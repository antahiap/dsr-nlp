EQ.0.0: Default, set to “2.0” 
EQ.1.0: |u1D4JD ≥ PC 
EQ.2.0: If |u1D7≠∆max  ≥ -PC, element spalls, and tension, |u1D4JD < 0, is 
never allowed. 
EQ.3.0: If |u1D4JD < PC element spalls, and tension, |u1D4JD < 0, is never 
allowed. 
RP |u1D44J|minuteCst.  If |u1D44J|minuteCst≠0.0, |u1D434 is not deﬁned.  See Remark 2 . *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-177 (MAT) |u1D44J|minuteCst=|u1D44J|u1D7≠+ 
|u1D434 , 
where |u1D44J is the gas constant and |u1D434 is the atomic weight.  If |u1D44J|minuteCst is not deﬁned, LS-
DYNA computes it with |u1D44J in the cm-gram-microsecond system of units. 
3.  Yield Strength.   The yield strength, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst, is given by: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆/u1D45C.st|minuteCst|<racketleftCvJ1 + |u1D44F′|u1D4JD|u1D449|oneCst|threeCst/fraction.v2−ℎ|parenleftCvJ|u1D438|u1D4J6Cst− |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst
3|u1D44J′− 300|parenriµhtCvJ |<racketriµhtCvJ|u1D4J2−/u1D45:.st|u1D438Cst|u1D4J6Csts
|u1D438Cst/u1D45A.sts−|u1D438Cst |u1D4J6Csts 
if |u1D438|u1D4JA exceeds |u1D438|u1D4J6 (see Remark 2).  Here, |u1D7≠∆/u1D45C.st|minuteCst is: 
|u1D7≠∆/u1D45C.st|minuteCst= |u1D7≠∆/u1D45C.st|<racketleftCv11 + |u1D6FD|parenleftCv1|u1D6F∆|u1D4J6Cst+ |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1|<racketriµhtCv1|u1D4JBCst 
where |u1D7≠∆/u1D45C.st is the initial yield stress and  |u1D6F∆|u1D4J6Cst is the initial plastic strain.  If the work-
hardened yield stress |u1D7≠∆/u1D45C.st|minuteCst exceeds |u1D4JA, |u1D7≠∆/u1D45C.st|minuteCst
 is set equal to |u1D4JA.  After the materials 
melt, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466 and |u1D43A are set to one half their initial value. 
4.  Cold Compression Energy.   If the coeﬃcients EC0, …, EC9 are not deﬁned 
above, LS-DYNA will ﬁt the cold compression energy to a ten term polynomial 
expansion either as a function of |u1D7≠7 or |u1D7≠2 depending on ﬁeld FLAG as: 
|u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠2|u1D4J6Cst|parenriµhtCv2 = |summationCv1 EC |u1D4J6Cst|u1D7≠2|u1D4J6Cst/nine.st
|u1D4J6Cst=|zeroCst
|u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠7|u1D4J6Cst|parenriµhtCv2 = |summationCv1 EC |u1D4J6Cst|u1D7≠7|u1D4J6Cst/nine.st
|u1D4J6Cst=|zeroCst 
where EC |u1D4J6Cst is the ith  coeﬃcient and: 
|u1D7≠2 =|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+/u1D45C.st
|u1D7≠7 =|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+/u1D45C.st− 1 
A linear least squares method is used to perform th e ﬁt. 
5.  Spall Models.   A choice of three spall models is oﬀered to repre sent material 
splitting, cracking, and failure under tensile load s.   
a)  Pressure Limit Model.   The pressure limit model, SPALL = 1, limits the h y- 
drostatic tension to the speciﬁed value, |u1D4JDcut .  If a pressure more tensile 
than this limit is calculated, the pressure is rese t to |u1D4JDcut .  This option is not 
strictly a spall model, since the deviatoric stress es are unaﬀected by the 
pressure reaching the tensile cutoﬀ, and the pressu re cutoﬀ value, |u1D4JDcut , 
remains unchanged throughout the analysis.   
b)  Maximum Principal Stress Spall Model.   The maximum principal stress spall 
model, SPALL = 2, detects spall if the maximum prin cipal stress, |u1D7≠∆max , ex- 
ceeds the limiting value - |u1D4JDcut .  Note that the negative sign is required be- *. _LUND
