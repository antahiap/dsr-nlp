  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
EQ.3.0:  Locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector /u1D42F with the 
element normal.   
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotr opic in cylindrical coordinate system 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D4JD, which deﬁne the centerline axis.  
This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR).   
A Flow potential exponent |u1D44∆ 
LCSS Load curve ID or table ID for (isotropic) hardening :  
GT.0: If LCSS is a load curve, then yield stress |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt is a function of 
plastic strain.  If LCSS is a table, then yield str ess |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt is a 
function of plastic strain and plastic strain rate.  
LT.0: If -LCSS is a load curve, then yield stress |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt is a function 
of plastic strain.  If -LCSS is a table, then yield  stress |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt is 
a function of plastic strain and temperature.

MACF Material axes change ﬂag for solid elements: 
EQ.-4: Switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450 before BETA rotation 
EQ.-3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450 before BETA rotation 
EQ.-2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F before BETA rotation  
EQ.1: No change, default 
EQ.2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F after BETA rotation 
EQ.3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450 after BETA rotation 
EQ.4: Switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450 after BETA rotation 
Figure M2-2  indicates when LS-DY NA applies MACF during the 
process to obtain the ﬁnal material axes.  If BETA on *ELE-
MENT_SOLID_ {OPTION}  is deﬁned, then that BE TA is used for *.   
 Each transformation matrix requires 9 coeﬃcients th at must be deﬁned on Cards 2, 3, 
and 4 of this material model input.  For identiﬁcat ion of all 18 coeﬃcients, uniaxial tests 
in several directions, biaxial tests, and crystal p lasticity models (for out-of-plane 
properties) are needed.  See Barlat et al.  [2005] for more details and examples for 
parameters sets. 
 
Note that the sequence of stress tensor components in LS-DYNA is as follows 
/u1D42C=
⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎡|u1D46≠|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst 
|u1D46≠|u1D466Cst|u1D466Cst 
|u1D46≠|u1D467Cst|u1D467Cst 
|u1D46≠|u1D46JCst|u1D466Cst 
|u1D46≠|u1D466Cst|u1D467Cst 
|u1D46≠|u1D467Cst|u1D46JCst ⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎤
 
meaning matrix entry “44” is linked to stress compo nent “ |u1D46J|u1D466 ”, “55” belongs to “ |u1D466 /u1D46̅”, and 
“66” refers to “ /u1D46̅|u1D46J ”. If compared to the paper from Barlat et al.  [20 05] that means the 
following relations hold (each equation: LS-DYNA pa rameters on the left, Barlat 
coeﬃcients on the right):
