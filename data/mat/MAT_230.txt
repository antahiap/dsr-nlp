 faces of this box may be open, as required by the g eometry of the problem.  For 
example, for a half-space problem, the “top” of the  box should be open. 
Internally, LS-DYNA will partition the entire PML i nto regions which form the 
“faces,” “edges” and “corners” of the above cuboid box, and generate a new 
material for each region.  This partitioning will b e visible in the d3plot  ﬁle.  The 
user may safely ignore this partitioning. 
4.  Number of Elements in Layer.   The layer should have 5-10 elements through 
its depth.  Typically, 5-6 elements are suﬃcient if  the excitation source is rea- 
sonably distant from the layer, and 8-10 elements i f it is close.  The size of the 
elements should be similar to that of elements in t he bounded domain near the 
layer, and should be small enough to suﬃciently dis cretize all signiﬁcant 
wavelengths in the problem. 
5.  Nodal Constraints.   The nodes on the outer boundary of the layer shou ld be 
fully constrained.  
6.  Stress and Strain.   The stress and strain values reported by this mat erial do 
not have any physical signiﬁcance. *. ) and *
