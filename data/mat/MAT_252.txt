LCSS Curve ID or Table ID 
Load Curve.  The curve speciﬁes yield stress /u1D̅0F/Y.st as a function of 
plastic strain |u1D4JF. 
Table Data.   If a 2D table is deﬁned, for each strain rate value  the 
table speciﬁes a curve ID giving the yield stress a s a function of 
plastic strain for that strain rate (see *DEFINE_TA BLE).  If a 3D 
table is deﬁned, for each temperature value, a tabl e ID is speciﬁed 
which, in turn, maps strain rates to curves giving the yield stress 
as a function of plastic strain (see DEFINE_TABLE_3 D). 
The yield stress as a function of plastic strain cu rve for the lowest 
value of strain rate or temperature is used when th e strain rate or 
temperature falls below the minimum value.  Likewis e, 
maximum values cannot be exceeded.  Hardening varia bles are 
ignored with this option (TAU0, Q, B, H, C, GAM0, a nd GAMM).

2.  FLG = 2 is used for the yield criterion |u1D4J3̂ which is changed at the vertex into the 
deviatoric  von Mises  yield function (see Figure M252-2 ) and is used for con- 
servative calculation in case of missing uniaxial c ompression or combined 
compression and shear experiments:

The yield functions |u1D4J3 and |u1D4J3̂ are formulated in terms of the eﬀective stress ten sor 
/u1D6D4/tilℂecomb.h1=/u1D6D4(1 − |u1D437) ⁄  
and the isotropic material damage |u1D437 according to the continuum damage mechanics in 
Lemaitre [1992].  The stress tensor /u1D6D4 is deﬁned in terms of the elastic strain  /u1D6C6|eCst and the 
isotropic damage |u1D437:  Figure M252-1.   Yield function |u1D4J3 and plastic ﬂow potential |u1D4J3∗

The second factor […] in /u1D̅0F/Y.st describes the rate dependency of the yield strengt h by a 
modiﬁed Johnson & Cook approach with the reference strain rates |u1D6F∆̇|zeroCst and |u1D6F∆̇|mCst which 
limit the shear strength /u1D̅0F/Y.st (see Figure M252-4 ).  
 
The second representation of the yield strength /u1D̅0F/Y.st is the table deﬁnition LCSS, where 
hardening can be deﬁned as a function of plastic st rain, strain rate, and temperature. 
 
Toughened structural adhesives show distortional ha rdening under plastic ﬂow, that is, 
the yield surface changes its shape.  This formativ e hardening can be phenomenological 
described by simple evolution equations of paramete rs |u1D44∆|oneCst= |u1D44∆̂|oneCst(|u1D4JF)  ∧  |u1D44∆|twoCst= |u1D44∆̂|twoCst(|u1D4JF) in the 
yield criterions |u1D4J3 with the initial values |u1D44∆|oneCst|zeroCst  and |u1D44∆|twoCst|zeroCst : 
|u1D44∆|oneCst= |u1D44∆̂|oneCst(|u1D4JF)∧|u1D44∆̇|oneCst= |u1D44∆|oneCst/H.st|u1D4JḞ

The parameters |u1D44∆|oneCst/H.st and |u1D44∆|twoCst/H.st can take positive or negative values as long as th e inequality 
|u1D44∆|twoCst≥ 0 is satisﬁed.  The criterion |u1D44∆|twoCst≥ 0 ensures an elliptic yield surface.  The yield 
criterion |u1D4J3̂ uses only the initial values |u1D44∆|oneCst= |u1D44∆|oneCst|zeroCst  and |u1D44∆|twoCst= |u1D44∆|twoCst|zeroCst  without the distortional 
hardening. 
 
The empirical isotropic damage model |u1D437 is based on the approach in Lemaitre [1985].  
Two diﬀerent evolution equations |u1D437/circum⨂lexcmb.h1̇(|u1D4JF, |u1D4JḞ) and |u1D437/c∙roncmb.h1̇(|u1D6F∆|vCst, |u1D6F∆̇|vCst) are available (see Fig- 
ure M252-5 ). The damage variable |u1D437 is formulated in terms of the damage plastic strai n 
rate |u1D4JḞ (DOPT = 0)
