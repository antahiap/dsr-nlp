  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
VC Viscous damping coeﬃcient (.05 < recommended val ue < .50) 
DFLG Density ﬂag: 
EQ.0.0:  Use initial density. 
EQ.1.0:  Use current density (larger step size with less mas s 
scaling). 
Remarks: 
The logarithmic volumetric strain is deﬁned in term s of the relative volume, |u1D449, as: 
|u1D6F∆ = −ln(|u1D449) . 
When deﬁning the curves, the stress and strain pair s should be positive values starting 
with a volumetric strain value of zero. *
