LS-DYNA R13 2-219 (MAT) All elements which reference a given part ID corres ponding to the rigid mate- 
rial should be contiguous, but this is not a requir ement.  If two disjoint groups 
of elements on opposite sides of a model are modele d as rigid, separate part 
IDs should be created for each of the contiguous el ement groups if each group 
is to move independently.  This requirement arises from the fact that LS-DYNA 
internally computes the six rigid body degrees-of-f reedom for each rigid body 
(rigid material or set of merged materials), and if  disjoint groups of rigid ele- 
ments use the same part ID, the disjoint groups wil l move together as one rigid 
body. 
3.  Inertial Properties.   Inertial properties for rigid materials may be de ﬁned in 
either of two ways.  By default, the inertial prope rties are calculated from the 
geometry of the constituent elements of the rigid m aterial and the density spec- 
iﬁed for the part ID.  Alternatively, the inertial properties and initial velocities 
for a rigid body may be directly deﬁned, and this o verrides data calculated 
from the material property deﬁnition and nodal init ial velocity deﬁnitions. 
4.  Contact and Material Constants.  Young's modulus, E, and Poisson's ratio, υ, 
are used for determining sliding interface paramete rs if the rigid body interacts 
in a contact deﬁnition.  Realistic values for these  constants should be deﬁned 
since unrealistic values may contribute to numerica l problems with contact. 
5.  Constraints.   Constraint directions for rigid materials (CMO eq ual to +1 or -1) 
are ﬁxed, that is, not updated, with time.  To impo se a constraint on a rigid 
body such that the constraint direction is updated as the rigid body rotates, use 
*BOUNDARY_PRESCRIBED_MOTION_RIGID_LOCAL. 
We strongly advise you not to apply nodal constrain ts, for instance, by 
*BOUNDARY_SPC_ OPTION , to nodes of a rigid body as doing so may com- 
promise the intended constraints in the case of an explicit simulation.  Such 
SPCs will be skipped in an implicit simulation and a warning issued.   
If the intended constraints are not with respect to  the calculated center-of-mass 
of the rigid body, *CONSTRAINED_JOINT_ OPTION  may often be used to 
obtain the desired eﬀect.  This approach typically entails deﬁning a second 
rigid body which is fully constrained and then deﬁn ing a joint between the two 
rigid bodies.  Another alternative for deﬁning rigi d body constraints that are 
not with respect to the calculated center-of-mass o f the rigid body is to manual- 
ly specify the initial center-of-mass location usin g *PART_INERTIA.  When 
using *PART_INERTIA, a full set of mass properties must be speciﬁed.  Note 
that the dynamic behavior of the rigid body, howeve r, is aﬀected by its mass 
properties.
