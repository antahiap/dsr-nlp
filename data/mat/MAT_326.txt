 The cohesive gasket material model is comprised of the following three un- 
coupled material models:  
a)  Isotropic linear elastic membrane stress: 
⎣⎢⎡|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst 
|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst ⎦⎥⎤= |u1D437
⎣⎢⎡|u1D7≠≠|oneCst|oneCst 
|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|twoCst 
2|u1D7≠≠|oneCst|twoCst ⎦⎥⎤ 
with |u1D437 as the constitutive matrix for either plane strain  or stress. 
b)  Isotropic linear elastic transverse stress: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|threeCst= |u1D438|u1D447Cst /u1D446.st |u1D44JCst |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst, |u1D4J6 = 1,2 
c)  A user deﬁned pressure-closure relation of the for m (see Remark 3 ): 
−|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst ≡|u1D4JD = |u1D4J3 (/u1D450),        /u1D450> 0
|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst = 0, otherwise  
3.  Pressure-Closure Relation.  The pressure-closure relation, |u1D4J3, is an important 
feature of the material model.  It can be used to i nclude mechanical eﬀects that 
are typical for gaskets, such as hysteresis.  It co nsists of a main loading curve 
and one or more unloading curves.  
Figure M326-1  gives a schematic of a pressure-closure response.  As the gasket 
is compressed the closure, /u1D450, increases and the pressure, |u1D4JD, follows the main 
loading curve from A to, say, B. Now, if the gasket  for some reason is unloaded 
at B, /u1D450 will then decrease and |u1D4JD follows the unloading curve BCA back to the 
initial conﬁguration A. If the gasket is then reloa ded it will follow the path 
ACB back to B. Then, when /u1D450 exceeds the closure value at point B, it will con-
