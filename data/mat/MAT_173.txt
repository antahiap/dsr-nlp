 For similar reasons, the shear modulus may reduce w ith plastic strain, but this 
option may sometimes give unstable results. 
5.  Additional Cohesion.   The load curves, LCCPDR, LCCPT, LCCJDR, and LC-
CJT, allow extra cohesion to be speciﬁed as a funct ion of time.  The cohesion is 
additional to that speciﬁed in the material paramet ers.  This is intended for use 
during the initial stages of an analysis to allow a pplication of gravity or other 
loads without cracking or yielding, and for the cra cking or yielding then to be 
introduced in a controlled manner.  This is done by  specifying extra cohesion 
that exceeds the expected stresses initially, then declining to zero.  If no curves 
are speciﬁed, no extra cohesion is applied. 
6.  Time-Dependent Properties.   LCSFAC, the load curve for factor on strength, 
applies simultaneously to the cohesion and tan (P H I)  of the parent material 
and all joints.  This feature is intended for reduc ing the strength of the material 
gradually to explore factors of safety.  If no curv e is present, a constant factor 
of 1 is assumed.  Values much greater than 1.0 may cause problems with stabil- 
ity.  Alternatively, separate functions of time may  be deﬁned for each of the 
properties GMOD, CVAL and PHI using load curves LCG MT, LCCVT and 
LCPHT, respectively.  
7.  ANISO.   The anisotropic factor, ANISO, applies the elasti c shear stiﬀness in the 
global /u1D44B |u1D44D  and /u1D44C |u1D44D  planes.  It can be used only in a pure Mohr-Coulom b mode 
(NPLANES = 0). 
8.  Tensile Pressure Limit.   For a friction angle greater than zero, the Mohr 
Coulomb yield surface implies a tensile pressure li mit equal to 
C V AL tan(P H I) ⁄. By default, voids develop in the material when th is pressure 
limit is reached, and the pressure will never becom e more tensile than the ten- 
sile pressure limit.  The volumetric void strain is  tracked and is reversible if the 
strain is reversed. 
9.  NOVOID.   If NOVOID = 1, then the tensile pressure limit is  not applied and 
stress states in which the pressure is more tensile  than C V AL tan(P H I) ⁄ are 
permitted but will be purely hydrostatic with no sh ear stress.  NOVOID is 
recommended in Multi-Material ALE simulations in wh ich the development of 
voids or air space is already accounted for by the Multi-Material ALE. 
10.  Soil or Rock.   To model soil, set NJOINT = 0. The joints allow m odeling of 
rock and are treated identically to those of *.   *. ) for a 
preferred alternative to this material model.
