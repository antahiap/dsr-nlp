The member slenderness ratio, |u1D7≠6,  is deﬁned as |u1D4J8Cst|u1D43FCst 
|u1D4JFCst, where /u1D458 depends on end conditions, /u1D4:F 
is the element length, and |u1D4JF is the radius of gyration such that |u1D434|u1D4JF|twoCst=/u1D4:C (and /u1D4:C=
min|parenleftCv2/u1D4:C|u1D466Cst|u1D466Cst ,/u1D4:C|u1D467Cst|u1D467Cst |parenriµhtCv2);  |u1D7≠6 will by default be calculated from the section prop erties and element 
length using /u1D458= 1. Optionally, this may be overridden by input param eter LAMDA to 
allow for diﬀerent end conditions.  
 
Optionally, you may provide a buckling curve BCUR.  The points of the curve give 
compressive displacement ( |u1D46J-axis) as a function of force ( |u1D466-axis); the ﬁrst point should 
have zero displacement and the initial buckling for ce.  Displacement and force should 
both be positive.  The initial buckling force must not be greater than the yield force.  
 
The tensile yield force (point 5 and segment 16-17 in Figure M171-1 ) is deﬁned by 
|u1D439|u1D466Cst= SIG Y × |u1D434, 
where yield stress SIGY is an input parameter and |u1D434 is the cross-sectional area. 
 
Following initial buckling and subsequent yield in tension, the member is assumed to 
be damaged.  The initial buckling curve is then sca led by input parameter CCBRF, 
leading to reduced strength curves such as segments  6-7, 10-14 and 18-19.  This  Figure M171-1.  Cyclic Behavior of a Steel Brace Displacemen tForce

 FEMA thresholds are the total axial strains (deﬁned  by change of length/initial length) 
at which the element is deemed to have passed from one category to the next, such as 
“Elastic”, “Immediate Occupancy”, “Life Safe”, etc.   During the analysis, the maximum 
tensile and compressive strains (“high tide strains ”) are recorded.  These are checked 
against the user-deﬁned limits TS1 to TS4 and CS1 t o CS4.  The output ﬂag is then set to 
0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 according to which limits have bee n passed.  The value in the output ﬁles 
is the highest such ﬂag from tensile or compressive  strains.  To plot this data, select IN-
TEGRATED beam results, Integration point 4, Axial S train. 
 
Maximum plastic strains in tension and compression are also output.  These are deﬁned 
as maximum total strain to date minus the yield or ﬁrst buckling strain for tensile and 
compressive plastic strains, respectively.  To plot  these, select INTEGRATED beam 
results, Integration point 4, “shear stress XY” and  “shear stress XZ” for tensile and 
compressive plastic strains, respectively. *
