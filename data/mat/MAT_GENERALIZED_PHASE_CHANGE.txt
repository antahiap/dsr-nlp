This is Material Type 254. It is designed to model phase transformations in materials 
and the implied changes in the material properties.   It is applicable to hot stamping, 
heat treatment and welding processes for a wide ran ge of materials.  It accounts for up 
to 24 phases and provides a list of generic phase c hange mechanisms for each possible 
phase changes. The parameters for the phase transfo rmation laws are to be given in 
tabulated form. 
Given the current microstructure composition, the f ormulation implements a 
temperature and strain-rate dependent elastic-plast ic material with non-linear 
hardening behavior.  Above a certain temperature, t he model shows an ideal elastic-
plastic behavior with no evolution of plastic strai ns. 
The material has been implemented for solid and she ll elements and is suitable for 
explicit and implicit analysis.

 a)  Koistinen-Marburger (KM), law 1 .  
The KM formulation is tailored for non-diﬀusive tra nsformations.  In the 
most basic and commonly used version, the temperatu re dependent 
amount of the target phase is computed as 
|u1D46J|u1D44FCst= (|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst)|parenleftCv21.0 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FC.stKM (|u1D447Cststart −|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv2  . 
PTXI deﬁnes the so-called Koistinen-Marburger facto r, |u1D6F+KM . 
b)  Generalized Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK), law 2 . 
This is a widely used model for diﬀusive phase tran sformation.  In litera- 
ture, often the incremental form of the JMAK equati on is given for an iso- 
thermal, incomplete transformation: 
|u1D46J|u1D44FCst= |u1D46Je q (|u1D447)(|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst)

⎠⎟⎞  . 
In the previous equation, exponent, |u1D4JB; equilibrium concentration, |u1D46Je q ; and 
relaxation time, /u1D̅0F, are functions of the temperature. 
In this material model, the diﬀerential form of the  JMAK equation is em- 
ployed which makes the model readily applicable for  non-isothermal pro- 
cesses:

In this evolution equation, the following factors a re deﬁned: 
/u1D458|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst =|u1D46J|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st(|u1D447)

As user input, load curve data for the exponent, |u1D4JB(|u1D447) , is deﬁned in PT-
TAB1, the equilibrium concentration, |u1D46Je q (|u1D447), in PTTAB2, and the relaxa- 
tion time, /u1D̅0F(|u1D447), in PTTAB3.  This model is a generalized JMAK appr oach 
that features additional parameters, such as the te mperature rate correc- 
tion factors, |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv1|u1D447̇|parenriµhtCv1 and |u1D4J3′|parenleftCv1|u1D447̇|parenriµhtCv1, given in PTTAB4 and PTTAB5, respectively.  
As an optional parameter an accelerator |u1D6F+|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1 for the transformation can 
be deﬁned as function of equivalent plastic strain in PTTAB6.  If not de- 
ﬁned, a constant value of 1.0 is assumed. 
Like the Koistinen-Marburger case, a temperature de pendent equilibrium 
concentration, |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst, of the source phase can optionally be deﬁned.  If  de- *.   
 For |u1D46J|u1D44FCst< |u1D46J|u1D44FCsttre , t he transformation scheme comprises three steps.  Fi rst, a 
temperature dependent equilibrium fraction for the starting phase is cal- 
culated based on an incomplete KM equation: 
|u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst= (|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst− |u1D46Jinc )|parenleftCv21.0 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FC.stKM |parenleftCv1|u1D447CstKM /comm∙.sts/u1D460.sts−|u1D447Cst|parenriµhtCv1|parenriµhtCv2  . 
The KM-parameter |u1D6F+KM  and the start temperature |u1D447KM /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D46≠Cst must be given in 
PTX1 and PTX2, respectively.  The incompleteness pa rameter |u1D46Jinc  is a 
function of temperature deﬁned in PTTAB4. 
Second, if the current fraction of the starting pha se |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst exceeds the calculat- 
ed equilibrium concentration |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst,  a diﬀusional process follows.  It is de- 
scribed by a JMAK approach.  Its incremental form f or an isothermal 
process is given by 
|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst= |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst+ |parenleftCv2|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst− |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst|parenriµhtCv2|u1D4J2−|parenleftCv4|u1D461Cst
/u1D̅0F.st(|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv4/u1D45B.sts(/u1D44̅.sts)
. 
Naturally, a diﬀerential form of this equation is u sed in the model in order 
to be applicable to non-isothermal situations.  The  ﬁnal calculated change 
∆|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst in identiﬁed with the formation of a recovery phas e |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst= −∆|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst.  The 
parameters for the JMAK equation are given in PTTAB 1 ( |u1D4JB) and PTTAB2 
(/u1D̅0F). 
Third, some of the recovery phase is partially tran sformed into the target 
phase: 
∆|u1D46J|u1D44FCst= |u1D6F∆(|u1D447)|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst  . 
The quotient |u1D6F∆(|u1D447)  can be deﬁned in PTTAB5. 
f)  Phase recovery II, law 6.  
This is the second part of the recovery and can onl y be deﬁned if the pre- 
vious transformation law (law 5) has also been deﬁn ed with the same 
starting phase.  This second step aims to transform  the remaining fraction 
of the virtual, recovery phase |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst into the physical phases deﬁned in the 
material. 
In order to allow for the deﬁnition of more than tw o target phases for one 
recovery process, an optional parameter |u1D7≠2(|u1D447)  can be deﬁned as the only 
input of this transformation in PTTAB1.  It is used  to control the transfor- 
mation by  
∆|u1D46J|u1D44FCst= |u1D7≠2(|u1D447)|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst  . 
Note that |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst here refers to the complete fraction of the recove ry phase as 
calculated by the JMAK approach.  If the parameter is not deﬁned, then 
the remainder of the virtual phase fraction is comp letely transformed. *.   
 Furthermore, an incomplete transformation is possib le in case of relatively 
slow cooling rates.  For this purpose, you can deﬁn e two rate limits |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|oneCst 
and |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|twoCst in PTX2 and PTX3, respectively, and an incompleten ess parame- 
ter |u1D46Jinc (|u1D447) as a function of temperature in PTTAB2.  The corre sponding 
equation for the transformation then is given by: 
|u1D46J|u1D44FCst=/˙raceleft.v6(|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst)|parenleftCv21.0 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FC.stKM (|u1D447Cststart −|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv2 , for   |u1D447̇< |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|oneCst
(|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst− |u1D46Jinc)|parenleftCv21.0 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FC.stKM (|u1D447Cststart −|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv2 , for |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|oneCst<  |u1D447̇< |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|twoCst  
 
A summary of input parameters for the diﬀerent mate rial laws is given in the 
following table.  If not stated otherwise, the para meters in the tabular data PT-
TAB i are expected to be functions of the current temper ature, |u1D447.

troduced incompleteness factor, |u1D6F+e q , as scalar input data in XAFPA. 
b)  Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK). For TASTART = 2, the evolution 
of the scale factor follows a JMAK-type approach.  For isothermal situa- 
tions and assuming a start time for the process of 0.0, an incremental form 
can be explicitly stated a 
|u1D6F+ = |u1D6F+e q (|u1D447) + |parenleftCv41 − |u1D6F+e q (|u1D447)|parenriµhtCv4|u1D4J2−|parenleftCv4|u1D461Cst
/u1D̅0F.st(|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv4/u1D45B.sts(/u1D44̅.sts)
. 
In the last equation, |u1D4JB(|u1D447)  denotes the exponent for the diﬀerential equa- 
tion, /u1D̅0F(|u1D447) the relaxation time and |u1D6F+|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st(|u1D447) denotes the limit value for the 
scale factor for inﬁnitely long processes.  All of those are functions of tem- 
perature and, thus, require the input of load curve  IDs in XAIPA1 ( |u1D4JB(|u1D447) ), 
XAIPA2 ( |u1D6F+e q (|u1D447)) and XAIPA3 ( /u1D̅0F(|u1D447)). 
In the material implementation a diﬀerential form o f the JMAK approach 
is invoked, which makes the formulation applicable to non-isothermal 
processes as well as independent of the start time of annealing. *
