Purpose:  This is Material Type 177.  This is a hig hly compressible foam based on the 
strain-energy function proposed by Hill [1979]; als o see Storakers [1986].  Poisson’s ratio 
eﬀects are taken into account.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label n ot exceeding 8 
characters must be speciﬁed. 
RO Mass density. 
K Bulk modulus.  This modulus is used for determining  the contact 
interface stiﬀness. 
N Material constant.  Deﬁne if LCID = 0 below; othe rwise, N is ﬁt 
from the load curve data.  See equations below. 
MU Damping coeﬃcient. 
LCID Load curve ID that deﬁnes the force per unit area v ersus the 
stretch ratio.  This curve can be given for either uniaxial or biaxial 
data depending on FITTYPE. 
FITTYPE Type of ﬁt: 
EQ.1:  uniaxial data, 
EQ.2:  biaxial data, 
EQ.3:  pure shear data. 
LCSR Load curve ID that deﬁnes the uniaxial or biaxial s tretch ratio (see 
FITTYPE) versus the transverse stretch ratio. 
Ci Material constants.  See equations below.  Deﬁne up  to 8 
coeﬃcients if LCID = 0. 
Bi Material constants.  See equations below.  Deﬁne up  to 8 
coeﬃcients if LCID = 0.

Remarks: 
If load curve data is deﬁned, the ﬁt generated by L S-DYNA must be closely checked in 
the d3hsp output ﬁle.  The nonlinear least squares procedure in LS-DYNA, which is 
used to ﬁt the data, may be inadequate.
