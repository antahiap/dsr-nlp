Purpose: This is a slimmed-down form of Material Ty pe 187. In contrast to the original 
SAMP-1 the options here are limited to rate indepen dent or rate dependent ﬂow in 
tension and compression as well as constant or vari able plastic Poisson’s ratio.  Shear 
and biaxial test data are not incorporated.  Damage  and failure are not available here.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCEMOD Load curve ID deﬁning Young’s modulus as function o f eﬀective 
strain rate.  LCEMOD ≠ 0 activates viscoelasticity (see Remark 3 ). 
The parameters BETA and RFILTF must be deﬁned too. 
BETA Decay constant in viscoelastic law (see Remark 3 ). BE TA has the 
unit [1/time].  If LCEMOD > 0 is used, a nonzero va lue for BE TA

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCID-T Load curve or table ID giving the yield stress as a  function of 
plastic strain.   These curves should be obtained f rom quasi- static 
and (optionally) dynamic uniaxial tensile tests.  T his input is 
mandatory.  If LCID-T is a table ID, the table valu es are eﬀ ective 
strain rates, and a curve of yield stress as a func tion of plastic 
strain must be given for each of those strain rates .  If the ﬁrst 
value in the table is negative, LS-DY NA assumes that all the table 
values represent the natural logarithm of eﬀe ctive strain rate.  
When the highest eﬀective strain rate is several or ders of 
magnitude greater than the lowest strain rate, it i s recommended 
that the natural log of strain rate be input in the  table.  See 
Remark 1 . 
LCID-C Optional load curve (or table) ID giving the yield stress as a 
function of plastic strain (and strain rate).  This  curve (or table) 
should be obtained from uniaxial compression tests.   If LCID- C is 
deﬁned as a curve and LCID-T given as a table, then the rate 
dependence from the tension table is adopted in com pression as 
well.  See Remark 1 .

and the plastic Poisson’s ratio /u1D̅08|u1D4JDCst deﬁnes the direction of plastic ﬂow. /u1D̅08|u1D4JDCstcan be 
input as a constant with NUEP or as a function of e quivalent plastic strain with 
LCID-P.  The elasto-plastic equations are solved wi th a classical predictor-
corrector algorithm for the plastic strain incremen t ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst and stress /u1D̅48|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst. 
2.  Effective strain rate.  If tables are used for hardening, the rate depende nce is 
deﬁned by using an eﬀective strain rate.  To reduce  the noise from the elastic 
portion of that strain rate, an averaged value is u sed.  This is governed by the 
ﬁltering parameter RFILTF as shown above. 
3.  Nonlinear viscoelasticity . For LCEMOD ≠ 0, viscoelasticity is activated.  Wi th 
this model, EMOD becomes the Young’s modulus for eq uilibrium stress ( |u1D438e q ). 
LCEMOD speciﬁes the viscous Young’s modulus which i s a function of aver- 
aged strain rate ( |u1D438|u1D463Cst(|u1D7≠≠̇a v g )). BETA gives a constant decay parameter specifying  
the ratio |u1D438Cst/u1D463.sts(|u1D7≠≠Csṫa v g )
/u1Dℜ02.st(|u1D7≠≠Csṫa v g ) where |u1D7≠2 is the viscosity.  The viscoelastic stress-strain law is 
given by: 
|u1D7≠∆̇|u1D463Cst= −BETA × |u1D7≠∆(|u1D461) + |u1D438|u1D463Cst(|u1D7≠≠̇a v g ) × |u1D7≠≠̇a v g  
The one-dimensional viscoelastic behavior can be vi sualized by a generalized 
Maxwell cell as rheological model as shown in Figure M187-1 . 
We will be using the notation of the viscoelastic-p lastic stress update.  For sim- 
plicity we will discuss the one-dimensional case.  Let ∆|u1D7≠≠v p  be the viscoplastic 
strain increment and let |u1D7≠∆e q  and |u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst be the equilibrium and viscous stress por- 
tions.  The stress update is then: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D7≠∆e q |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst 
or with stress increments: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst+ ∆|u1D7≠∆e q + ∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst. *.
