the ﬂuid density, and |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst is the deviatoric strain rate. *. 2 (4 cards follow)

the midsurface between the inner su rface and outer 
surface deﬁned by the ﬁrst four nodes and the last four 
nodes of the connectivity of the element, respectiv ely.  
Thus, for solid elements, AOPT = 3 is only available for 
hexahedrons. /u1D41A is determined by taking the cross 
product of /u1D42F with the normal vector, /u1D41B is determined 
by taking the cross product of the normal vector wi th /u1D41A, 
and /u1D41C is the normal vector.  Then /u1D41A and /u1D41B are rotated 
about /u1D41C by an angle BETA. BE TA may be set in the 
keyword input for the element or in the input for t h is

be switched depending on the choice of MACF. The 
switch may occur before or after applying BETA de-

G Shear modulus for frequency independent damping.  F requency 
independent damping is based on a spring and slider  in series.

SIGF.  This option applies only to solid elements.

Material Directions: 
We will give an overview of how LS-DYNA ﬁnds the pr incipal material directions for 
solid and shell elements for this material and othe r anisotropic materials based on the 
input.  We will call the material coordinate system  the {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} coordinate system.  The 
AOPT options illustrated in Figure M2-1  deﬁne the preliminary {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} system for all 
elements of the parts that use the material, but th is is not the ﬁnal material direction.  
The {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} system deﬁned by the AOPT options may be oﬀset by a ﬁnal rotation about 
the /u1D41C-axis.  The oﬀset angle we call BETA. Note that *EL EMENT_SOLID_ORTHO and 
*ELEMENT_SHELL_MCID allow you to set the preliminar y {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} coordinate system 
for individual solid and shell elements, instead of  using the preliminary system created 
with AOPT. Figures M2-2  and M2-3  give the ﬂow chart for ﬁnding the ﬁnal material 
direction based on the input to the *MAT keyword an d the *ELEMENT keyword.  As 
indicated in the ﬁgures, the orientation of the ﬁna l material axes is updated 
continuously through the simulation as the element moves and deforms, in accordance 
with the invariant numbering scheme (INN in *CONTRO L_ACCURACY). 
 
For solid elements, the BETA angle is speciﬁed in o ne of two ways.  When using 
AOPT = 3, the BETA parameter deﬁnes the oﬀset angle  for all elements that use the 
material.  The BETA parameter on *MAT has no meanin g for the other AOPT options.  
Alternatively, a BETA angle can be deﬁned for indiv idual solid elements as described in 
Remark 5 for *ELEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO.  The BETA angle set using the ORTHO 
option is available for all values of AOPT, and it overrides the BETA angle on the *MAT 
card for AOPT = 3 (see Figure M2-2 ). Note that when the BETA angle is applied in 
either case depends on the value of MACF (if availa ble) of the *MAT keyword.  With 
MACF two of the material directions may be switched .  
 
There are two fundamental diﬀerences between shell and solid element orthotropic 
materials.  (In the following discussion, tshell el ements fall into the “shell” category.)  
First, the /u1D41C-direction is always normal to a shell element such  that the /u1D41A and /u1D41B-directions 
are within the plane of the element.  Second, for s ome anisotropic materials, shell 
elements may have unique ﬁber directions within eac h layer through the thickness of 
the element so that a layered composite can be mode led with a single element.

EPS1, … Volumetric strain values in pressure as a function of volumetric 
strain curve (see Remarks below).  A maximum of 10 values 
including 0.0 are allowed and a minimum of 2 values  are 
necessary.  If EPS1 is not 0.0, then a point (0.0, 0.0)  will be 
automatically generated and a maximum of nine value s may be 
input.

Remarks: 
1.  Variable Deﬁnitions.  Pressure is positive in compression.  Volumetric st rain is 
given by the natural log of the relative volume and  is negative in compression.  
Relative volume is a ratio of the current volume to  the initial volume at the 
start of the calculation.  The tabulated data shoul d be given in order of increas- 
ing compression.  If the pressure drops below the c utoﬀ value speciﬁed, it is 
reset to that value.  For a detailed description we  refer to Kreig [1972]. The bulk unloading modulus is used
if the volumetric crushing option is on 
(VCR = 0).  In thiscase the aterial's response
follows the black arrows.Loading and unloading (along the grey
arows) follows the input curve when the
volumetric crushing option is off (VCR = 1.0)

PR Poisson’s ratio (used for null beams and shells only) 
Remarks: 
These remarks apply to solids and thick shells only . 
1.  Material Model.   When used with solids or thick shells, this mater ial must be 
used with an equation-of-state.  Pressure cutoﬀ is negative in tension.  A (devi- 
atoric) viscous stress of the form,  
|u1D7≠∆|minuteCst
|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = 2|u1D7≠7|u1D7≠≠|minuteCsṫ|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   ,  
is computed for nonzero |u1D7≠7, where |u1D7≠≠′̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  is the deviatoric strain rate and |u1D7≠7 is the 
dynamic viscosity.  Analyzing the dimensions of the  above equation gives 
units of the components in SI of 
|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|<racketriµhtCvJ~|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ |<racketleftCvJ1
|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ  . 
Therefore, |u1D7≠7 may have units of [Pa × s]. 
2.  Hourglass Control.   Null materials have no shear stiﬀness (except fro m 
viscosity) and hourglass control must be used with great care.  In some appli- 
cations, the default hourglass coeﬃcient may lead t o signiﬁcant energy losses.  
In general, for ﬂuids the hourglass coeﬃcient QM sh ould be small (in the range 
10 -6 to 10 -4), and the hourglass type IHQ should be set to 1 (d efault). 
3.  Yield Strength.   The Null material has no yield strength and behav es in a 
ﬂuid-like manner. 
4.  Cut-off Pressure.   The cut-oﬀ pressure, PC, must be deﬁned to allow for a 
material to “numerically” cavitate.  In other words , when a material undergoes 
dilatation above certain magnitude, it should no lo nger be able to resist this 
dilatation.  Since dilatation stress or pressure is  negative, setting the PC limit to 
a very small negative number would allow for the ma terial to cavitate once the 
pressure in the material goes below this negative v alue. *. 2 / *. 2 / .  3 and *. 2) and the anisotropic plast ic material model (*. 2 for a complete
