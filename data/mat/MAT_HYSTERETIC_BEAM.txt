 PHA and BETA are the IDs of the load curves (see *D EFINE_CURVE) that 
deﬁne the yield loci in |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst- |u1D439 and |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst- |u1D439 planes.  The program will automatically 
ﬁnd the set of parameters ALPHA, BETA, GAMMA, SFS, SFT, SFAT, SFAC, F0, 
DELTAS, KAPPAS, DELTAT and KAPPAT that best ﬁts the  yield loci and the 
yield surface type ISURF.  
5.  Skew Yield Surface.  Reinforced concrete sections with asymmetric reinf orce- 
ment have a skew yield surface, meaning that the be nding moment capacities 
at zero axial force are diﬀerent in positive and ne gative bending, and the max- 
imum axial capacity occurs at a nonzero bending mom ent. Furthermore, the 
axial load at which maximum biaxial bending moment occurs depends on the 
angle of the bending axis. This can be modelled wit h ISURF = 3, where DEL- 
TAS and DELTAT control the slope of the line connec ting peak tensile and 
compressive strength vertices, and KAPPAS and KAPPA T control the slope of 
the line connecting peak moment vertices (which lie s in the balance plane). 
 
6.  Hardening Behavior during Cyclic Deformation (Hyste resis).  The input 
parameter IHARD determines how the force as a funct ion of deformation and 
moment as a function of rotation curves on Card 2  are applied during cyclic 
deformation.  In this case, “deformation” includes both axial deformation and 
rotation at plastic hinges. If IHARD = 1, the absci ssa represents cumulative 
absolute plastic deformation.  This quantity is alw ays positive. It increases 
whenever there is deformation in either direction.  Thus, during hysteresis, the 
yield moments are taken from points in the input cu rve with increasingly posi- 
tive deformation. If the curve shows a degrading be havior (reducing strength 
with deformation), then, once degraded by plastic d eformation, the yield force 
or moment can never recover to its initial value.  This option can be described F

 as PINM does on ﬂexure hysteresis.  See Figure M209-5 . 
8.  Kinematic Hardening. Kinematic hardening (Bauschinger eﬀect, whereby an 
increase in tensile yield strength occurs at the ex pense of compressive yield 
strength) is modelled by shift of the yield surface  and is controlled by input 
parameters HARDxx and GAMxx, where xx is MS, MT, AT , and AC for mo- 
ment about |u1D46≠-axis, moment about |u1D461-axis, axial tension and axial compression, 
respectively.  HARDxx is the rate at which the yiel d surface shifts, in units of 
force/displacement or force/strain for axial respon se (depending on the set- 
ting of IAX) and in units of moment/rotation for ﬂe xure response.  GAMxx is 
deﬁned such that HARDxx/GAMxx is the maximum force or moment by 
which the yield surface can shift.  
 
 
9.  Degradation, Damage and Element Erosion.  Stiﬀness and strength 
degradation are modelled using a damage approach. T he damaged fraction of 
the material does not contribute to the forces, the  moments or the stiﬀness. 
Damage is calculated in two stages: 
a)  a single damage parameter based on passing FEMA th resholds, and 
b)  component-speciﬁc damage (where “component” means axial tension, ax- 
ial compression, bending about s-axis and bending a bout t-axis). Ks

 IHARD. Optionally, the shear strengths can be user- deﬁned functions of the 
axial force; this is obtained by setting SFSHS and SFSHT to negative values. 
11.  FEMA Thresholds.  FEMA thresholds are used in performance-based 
earthquake engineering to classify the response acc ording to the level of de- 
formation.  The thresholds are the divisions betwee n regimes such as “Elastic”, 
“Immediate Occupancy”, “Life Safe”, etc. Output par ameters indicate the sta- 
tus of each element with respect to these regimes.  The thresholds are deﬁned 
by input parameters PRS n, PRT n, TS n, CS n, SS n, ST n where n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 
for the diﬀerent regimes.  PRS and PRT are plastic rotation about the |u1D46≠ and |u1D461 
axes, TS and CS are tensile and compressive strain or deformation according to 
the setting of IAX, and SS and ST are shear strains  in the |u1D46≠ and |u1D461 directions.  The 
corresponding output parameters, described as “FEMA  ﬂags” (see Remark 12 ) 
are “high-tide” values indicating which thresholds have been passed during 
the analysis, for example 3.25 means that the maxim um deformation that has 
occurred to date exceeds threshold 3 and is one qua rter of the way from 
threshold 3 to threshold 4. 
12.  Output.  In addition to the six resultants written for all beam elements, this 
material model writes a further 50 extra history va riables to the d3plot  and 
d3thdt  ﬁles, given in the table below. The data is writte n in the same position 
in these ﬁles as where integrated beams write the s tresses and strains at inte- 
gration points requested by BEAMIP on *DATABASE_EXT ENT_BINARY. 
Therefore, some post-processors may interpret this data as if the elements were 
integrated beams with 10 integration points, and in  that case the data may be 
accessed by selecting the appropriate integration p oint and data component:
