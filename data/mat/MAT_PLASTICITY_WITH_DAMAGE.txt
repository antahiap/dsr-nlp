This manual entry applies to both types 81 and 82.  Materials 81 and 82 model an elas to-
visco-plastic material with user-deﬁned isotropic stress versus strain curves, which, 
themselves, may be strain-rate dependent.  This mod el accounts for the eﬀects of 
damage prior to rupture based on an eﬀective plasti c-strain measure.  Additionally, 
failure can be triggered when the time step drops b elow some speciﬁed value.  Adding 
an orthotropic damage option will invoke material t ype 82.  Since type 82 must track 
directional strains it is, computationally, more ex pensive.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
strain rate is used.  C, P, LCSR, EPS1 - EPS8, and ES1 - ES8 are 
ignored if a table ID is deﬁned. 
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   If the ﬁrst  value in the table is 
negative, LS-DY NA assumes that all the table values represent 
the natural logarith m of a strain rate.  Since the tables are 
internally discretized to equally space the table v alues, it makes 
good sense from an accuracy standpoint that the tab le values 
represent the natural log of strain rate when the l owest strain rate 
and highest strain rate diﬀer by several orders of magnitude.

VP Formulation for rate eﬀects: 
EQ.0.0:  Scale yield stress (default) 
EQ.1.0:  Viscoplastic formulation 
LCDM Optional curve ID deﬁning nonlinear damage curve.  If this curve 
is speciﬁed, either EPPF or EPPFR must also be inpu t.  If LCDM, 
EPPF, and EPPFR are all nonzero, then EPPFR is igno red. 
NUMINT Numbe r of through thickness integration points which mus t fail 
before a shell element is deleted.  (If zero, all p oints must fail.)  
The default of all integration points is not recomm ended since 
shells undergoing large strain are often not delete d due to nodal 
ﬁber rotations which limit strains at active integr ation points after 
most points have failed.  Better results are obtain ed if NU MINT is 
set to 1 or a number less than one half of the numb er of through 
thickness points.  For example, if four through thi ckness points 
are used, NU MINT should not exceed 2, even for fully integrated  
shells which have 16 integration points. 
EPS1 - EPS8 Eﬀective plastic strain values (optional if SIGY is  deﬁned).  At 
least 2 points should be deﬁned.

This latter equation is always used if the viscopla stic option is oﬀ. 
b)  For complete generality a load curve (LCSR) to sca le the yield stress may 
be input instead.  In this curve the scale factor a s a function of strain rate is 
deﬁned. 
c)  If diﬀerent stress as a function of strain curves can be provided for various 
strain rates, a table (LCSS) can be used.  Then the  table input in 
*DEFINE_TABLE is expected; see Figure M24-1 . 
2.  Damage.  The constitutive properties for the damaged materi al are obtained 
from the undamaged material properties.  The amount  of damage is represent- 
ed |u1D714 which varies from zero if no damage has occurred t o unity for complete 
rupture.  For uniaxial loading, the nominal stress in the damaged material is 
given by

deﬁnes the degradations of the material by the Rc-D c model. 
For the Rc-Dc model the gradient of damage needs to  be estimated.  The dam- 
age is connected to the integration points, and, th us, the computation of the 
gradient requires some manipulation of the LS-DYNA source code.  Provided 
that the damage is connected to nodes, it can be se en as a standard bilinear 
ﬁeld and the gradient is easily obtained.  To enabl e this, the damage at the in- 
tegration points are transferred to the nodes as fo llows.  Let |u1D438|u1D4JBCst be the set of 
elements sharing node |u1D4JB, ||u1D438|u1D4JBCst| be the number of elements in that set, |u1D443|u1D4J2Cst be the 
set of integration points in element |u1D4J2 and |dividesCv1|u1D443|u1D4J2Cst|dividesCv1 be the number of points in that 
set.  The average damage |u1D437/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D4J2Cst in element |u1D4J2 is computed as  
|u1D437/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D4J2Cst=∑ |u1D437|u1D4JDCst |u1D4JDCst∈|u1D443Cst|u1D4J2Csts
|dividesCv1|u1D443|u1D4J2Cst|dividesCv1 
where |u1D437|u1D4JDCst is the damage in integration point |u1D4JD. Finally, the damage value in 
node |u1D4JB is estimated as 
|u1D437|u1D4JBCst=∑ |u1D437/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D4J2Cst |u1D4J2Cst∈|u1D438Cst/u1D45B.sts
||u1D438|u1D4JBCst|. 
This computation is performed in each time step and  requires additional stor- 
age.  Currently we use three times the total number  of nodes in the model for 
this calculation, but this could be reduced by a co nsiderable factor if necessary.   
 
There is an Rc-Dc option for the Gurson dilatationa l-plastic model.  In the im- 
plementation of this model, the norm of the gradien t is computed diﬀerently.
