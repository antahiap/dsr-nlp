  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
RS Rupture strain.  See Remark 2 . 
ASFF Weld assembly simultaneous failure ﬂag (see Remark 4 ): 
EQ.0:  Damaged elements fail individually. 
EQ.1:  Damaged elements fail when ﬁrst reaches failure 
criterion. 
TRUE_T True weld thickness for single hexahedron solid wel d elements.  
See Remark 3 . 
CON_ID Connection ID of *DEFINE_CONNEC TION card.  A negative 
CON_ID deactivates failure; see Remark 6 . 
RFILTF Smoothing factor on the eﬀective strain rate (default is 0.0), 
potentially used in table DSIGY < 0 and in functions for 
PRUL.ge.2 (see *DEFINE_CONNECTION_PROPERTIES).

JTOL Tolerance value for relative volume change (de fault: JTOL = 0.01).  
Solid element spot welds with a Jacobian less than JTOL w ill be 
eroded.  
Remarks: 
1.  Loading Solid Welds Uniaxially. We have implemented two methods of 
loading solid and solid weld assemblies uniaxially.   The older method is in- 
voked by deﬁning the elastic modulus, |u1D438, as a negative number where the ab- 
solute value of |u1D438 is the desired value for |u1D438.  This uniaxial option causes the two 
transverse stress terms to be assumed to be zero th roughout the calculation.  
This assumption eliminates parasitic transverse str ess that causes slow growth 
of plastic strain-based damage.  
The other method is invoked by setting OPTION  to UNIAXIAL. This method is 
preferred.  It causes the two transverse stress ter ms and the two transverse 
strains terms to be set to zero.  It was added beca use we found that the older 
method sometimes induced spurious oscillations in t he axial force, leading to 
premature failure.  
The motivation for the uniaxial options can be expl ained with a weld loaded in 
tension.  Due to Poisson’s eﬀect, an element in ten sion would be expected to 
contract in the transverse directions.  However, be cause the weld nodes are *. DAIMLERCHRYSLER  
 6.  Deactivating Weld Failure.  An option to deactivate weld failure is switched 
on by setting CON_ID to a negative value where the absolute value of CON_-
ID becomes the connection ID.  When weld failure is  deactivated, the failure 
function is evaluated and output to swforc  and dcfail , but the weld retains its 
full strength. *
