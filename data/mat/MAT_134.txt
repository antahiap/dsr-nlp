 Viscoelastic Constant Cards.   Up to 6 cards may be input.  A keyword (“*” ) card 
terminates this input if fewer than 6 cards are use d.  These cards are not needed if 
relaxation data is deﬁned.  The number of terms for  the shear behavior may diﬀer from 
that for the bulk behavior: simply insert zero if a  term is not included.

Remarks: 
Rate eﬀects are taken into accounted through linear  viscoelasticity through a 
convolution integral of the form: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst 
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F   , 
where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) is the relaxation function.  If we wish to include  only simple rate 
eﬀects for the deviatoric stresses, the relaxation function is represented by six terms 
from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4JACst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst . 
We characterize this function by the input shear mo duli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and decay constants, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.  
An arbitrary number of terms, up to 6, may be used when applying the viscoelastic 
model.  
 
For volumetric relaxation, the relaxation function is also represented by the Prony series 
in terms of bulk moduli: 
/u1D458(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43∆|u1D4JACst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D̅05.sts/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst . *
