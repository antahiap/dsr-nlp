Formulation: 
The eﬀective plastic strain used in this model is d eﬁned to be plastic work equivalent.  
A consequence of this is that for parameters deﬁned  as functions of eﬀective plastic 
strain, the rolling (00) direction should be used a s reference direction.  For instance, the 
hardening curve for HR = 3 is the stress as functio n of strain for uniaxial tension in the *. -PARAMETER_BARLAT

The anisotropy parameter |u1D4JD is calculated implicitly.  According to Barlat and  Lian the |u1D44J-
value, width to thickness strain ratio, for any ang le /u1D̅1∫ can be calculated from:

where |u1D7≠∆/u1D̅1∫.st is the uniaxial tension in the /u1D̅1∫ direction.  This expression can be used to 
iteratively calculate the value of |u1D4JD.  Let /u1D̅1∫= 45  and deﬁne a function |u1D4J4 as: 
|u1D4J4|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1 =2|u1D4JA|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st|u1D4JACst

An iterative search is used to ﬁnd the value of |u1D4JD.  If PB > 0, material parameters |u1D44∆(AB), 
/u1D450(CB), ℎ(HB), and |u1D4JD(PB) are used directly.

With hardening rule HR = 10, the ﬂow curves in a ta ble deﬁnition can be based on 
diﬀerent pre-strain values.  Hence ﬂow curves can h ave varying shapes as deﬁned in 
the corresponding table.  For example, the plastic strain distribution as obtained in a 
ﬁrst step of a two-stage procedure is initialized i n the next stage with *INITIAL_-
STRESS_SHELL and corresponding values for EPS. With  HR = 10 this pre-strain is 
initially transferred to history variable #9 and al l stresses and other history variables are 
set to zero assuming that the part was subjected to  an annealing phase.  With EPS now 
stored on history variable #9 the table lookup for the actual yield value may now be 
used to interpolate on diﬀerently shaped ﬂow curves .  
A failure criterion for nonlinear strain paths (NLP ) in sheet metal forming: 
When the option NLP is used, a necking failure crit erion is activated to account for the 
non-linear strain path eﬀect in sheet metal forming .  Based on the traditional Forming 
Limit Diagram (FLD) for the linear strain path, the  Formability Index (F.I.) is calculated 
for every element in the model throughout the simul ation duration.  The entire F.I. time 
history for every element is stored in history vari able #1 in d3plot  ﬁles, accessible from 
Post/History  menu in LS-PrePost  v4.0.  In addition to the F.I. output, other usefu l 
information stored in other history variables can b e found as follows, 
1.  Formability Index: #1 
2.  Strain ratio (in-plane minor strain increment/majo r strain increment): #2 
3.  Eﬀective strain from the planar isotropic assumptio n : #3

Shown in Figures M36-1 , M36-2  and M36-3 , predictions and validations of forming limit 
curves (FLC) of various nonlinear strain paths on a  single shell element was done using 
this new option, for an Aluminum alloy with |u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst = 0.8, |u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst = 0.6 |u1D44∆|u1D4JB|u1D4J1 |u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst = 0.55  and the 
yield at 130.0 MPa.  In each case, the element is f urther strained in three diﬀerent paths 
(uniaxial stress – U.A., plane strain – P.S., and e qui-biaxial strain – E.B.) separately, 
following a pre-straining in uniaxial, plane strain  and equi-biaxial strain state, 
respectively.  The forming limits are determined at  the end of the secondary straining 
for each path, when the F.I. has reached the value of 1.0.  It is seen that the predicted 
FLCs (dashed curves) in case of the nonlinear strai n paths are totally diﬀerent from the 
FLCs under the linear strain paths.  It is noted th at the current predicted FLCs under 
nonlinear strain path are obtained by connecting th e ends of the three distinctive strain 
paths.  More detailed FLCs can be obtained by strai ning the elements in more paths 
between U.A. and P.S. and between P.S. and E.B.  In  Figure M36-4 , time-history plots of 
F.I., strain ratio and eﬀective strain are shown fo r uniaxial pre-strain followed by equi-
biaxial strain path on the same single element. 
 
Typically, to assess sheet formability, F.I. contou r of the entire part should be plotted.  
Based on the contour plot, non-linear strain path a nd the F.I. time history of a few 
elements in the area of concern can be plotted for further study.  These plots are similar 
to those shown in manual pages of *. -PARAMETER_BARLAT  *. -PARAMETER_BARLAT

PARAMETER_BARLAT. The HOSF = 1 allows for a “Hosfor d-based” eﬀective stress in 
the yield function instead of using the Barlat-base d eﬀective stress. If the material and 
principal axes are coincident, the plastic potentia l Φ for HOSF = 1 can be written as 
 
Φ(|u1D7≠∆) =1
2|parenleftCv1||u1D7≠∆|oneCst||u1D4JACst+ ||u1D7≠∆|twoCst||u1D4JACst+ ||u1D7≠∆|oneCst− |u1D7≠∆|twoCst||u1D4JACst|parenriµhtCv1 − |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D4JACst 
  
The main diﬀerence is that the Barlat-based eﬀectiv e stress contains the orthotropic 
parameters |u1D44∆,/u1D450,ℎ and |u1D4JD in the yield function meanwhile the Hosford-based eﬀective 
stress does not contain any information about the a nisotropy.  For HOSF = 1, the 
information about direction dependent yielding is d irectly obtained from the hardening 
curves LCH00, LCH45 and LCH90. For materials exhibi ting very dissimilar |u1D44J −values 
in the diﬀerent material directions (e.g. typical a luminum extrusion), HOSF = 0 might 
(but does not necessarily) lead to concave yield su rfaces which, in turn, might lead to 
numerical instabilities under certain circumstances .  HOSF = 1 tends to reduce this 
eﬀect. 
 
More information on the theoretical and numerical f oundations of HOSF = 1 can be

orthotropic plasticity model in LS-DYNA  (2019). *. 6) to model metal sheets und er cyclic plasticity loading with 
anisotropy in plane stress condition.  Lankford par ameters are used for the deﬁnition of 
the anisotropy.  Yoshida’s theory describes the har dening rule with a “two surfaces” 
method: the yield surface and the bounding surface.   In the forming process, the yield 
surface does not change in size, but its center mov es with deformation; the bounding 
surface changes both in size and location.

NLP 
The NLP option estimates necking failure using the Formability Index (F.I.), which 
accounts for the non-linear strain paths seen in me tal forming applications (see Remark 
4).  When using this option, specify IFLD in Card 3.   Since the NLP option also works 
with a linear strain path, it is recommended to be used as the default failure criterion in 
metal forming.  The NLP option is also available fo r *. 19  *. 19 keyword name cannot be used in the

 The cohesive gasket material model is comprised of the following three un- 
coupled material models:  
a)  Isotropic linear elastic membrane stress: 
⎣⎢⎡|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst 
|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst ⎦⎥⎤= |u1D437
⎣⎢⎡|u1D7≠≠|oneCst|oneCst 
|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|twoCst 
2|u1D7≠≠|oneCst|twoCst ⎦⎥⎤ 
with |u1D437 as the constitutive matrix for either plane strain  or stress. 
b)  Isotropic linear elastic transverse stress: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|threeCst= |u1D438|u1D447Cst /u1D446.st |u1D44JCst |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst, |u1D4J6 = 1,2 
c)  A user deﬁned pressure-closure relation of the for m (see Remark 3 ): 
−|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst ≡|u1D4JD = |u1D4J3 (/u1D450),        /u1D450> 0
|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst = 0, otherwise  
3.  Pressure-Closure Relation.  The pressure-closure relation, |u1D4J3, is an important 
feature of the material model.  It can be used to i nclude mechanical eﬀects that 
are typical for gaskets, such as hysteresis.  It co nsists of a main loading curve 
and one or more unloading curves.  
Figure M326-1  gives a schematic of a pressure-closure response.  As the gasket 
is compressed the closure, /u1D450, increases and the pressure, |u1D4JD, follows the main 
loading curve from A to, say, B. Now, if the gasket  for some reason is unloaded 
at B, /u1D450 will then decrease and |u1D4JD follows the unloading curve BCA back to the 
initial conﬁguration A. If the gasket is then reloa ded it will follow the path 
ACB back to B. Then, when /u1D450 exceeds the closure value at point B, it will con-
