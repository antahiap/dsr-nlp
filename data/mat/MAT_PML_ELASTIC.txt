Remarks: 
1.  Unboundedness.  A layer of this material may be placed at a boundar y of a 
bounded domain to simulate unboundedness of the dom ain at that boundary: 
the layer absorbs and attenuates waves propagating outward from the domain, 
without any signiﬁcant reﬂection of the waves back into the bounded domain.  
The layer cannot support any static displacement.  
2.  Material Properties of Bounded Domain.   It is assumed the material in the 
bounded domain near the layer is, or behaves like, a linear ﬂuid material.  The 
material properties of the layer should be set to t he corresponding properties 
of this material.  *
