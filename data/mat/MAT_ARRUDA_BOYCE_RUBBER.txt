This is Material Type 127.  This material model pro vides a hyperelastic rubber model 
(see [Arruda and Boyce 1993]) combined optionally w ith linear viscoelasticity as 
outlined by [Christensen 1980].

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
K Bulk modulus 
G Shear modulus 
N Number of statistical links

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
are determined using a least squares ﬁt.  This rela xation curve is 
shown in Figure M76-1 .  This model ignores the constant stress. 
TRAMP Optional ramp time for loading 
NT Number of Prony series terms in optional ﬁt.  If ze ro, the default 
is 6.  Currently, the maximum number is 6.  Values less than 6, 
possibly 3- 5 are recommended, since each term used adds 
signiﬁcantly to the cost.  Caution should be exercised when taking 
the results from the ﬁt.  Always check the results of the ﬁt in the 
output ﬁle.  Preferably, all generated coeﬃcients s hould be 
positive.  Negative values may lead to unstable res ults.  Once a 
satisfacto ry ﬁt has been achieved, it is recommended that the  
coeﬃcients which are written into the output ﬁle be  input in 
future runs. 
Gi Optional shear relaxation modulus for the ith  term. 
BETA i Optional decay constant if ith  term. 
Remarks: 
Rubber is generally considered to be fully incompre ssible since the bulk modulus 
greatly exceeds the shear modulus in magnitude.  To  model the rubber as an 
unconstrained material a hydrostatic work term, /u1D44A|u1D43BCst(/u1D4:D), is included in the strain energy 
functional which is function of the relative volume , /u1D4:D, [Ogden 1984]: 
/u1D44A(/u1D4:D|oneCst,/u1D4:D|twoCst,/u1D4:D) = |u1D4JB /u1D458/u1D̅0:|<racketleftCvJ1

where the hydrostatic work term is in terms of the bulk modulus, |u1D43∆, and the third 
invariant, /u1D4:D, as: 
/u1D44A|u1D43BCst(/u1D4:D) =|u1D43∆
2(/u1D4:D− 1)|twoCst 
Rate eﬀects are taken into account through linear v iscoelasticity by a convolution 
integral of the form: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst

or in terms of the second Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress, |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , and Green's strain tensor, |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , *
