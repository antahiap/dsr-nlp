The relative volume, |u1D449, is deﬁned as the ratio of the current volume over  the 
initial volume, and typically, |u1D449 = 1  at the beginning of a calculation.  
For corotational solid elements, types 0 and 9, the  components of the stress 
tensor remain uncoupled and the uncompressed elasti c moduli are used, that 
is, the fully compacted elastic moduli are ignored.  
3.  Stress Update for Uncompacted Material.   The load curves deﬁne the 
magnitude of the stress as the material undergoes d eformation.  The ﬁrst value 
in the curve should be less than or equal to zero c orresponding to tension and 
increase to full compaction.  Care should be taken when deﬁning the curves so the  
extrapolated values do not lead to negative yield s tresses.  
At the beginning of the stress update we transform each element’s stresses and 
strain rates into the local element coordinate syst em.  After completing the 
stress update we transform the stresses back to the  global conﬁguration.  For 
the uncompacted material, the trial stress componen ts are updated using the 
elastic interpolated moduli according to: 0Curve extends into negative strain 
quadrant since LS-DYNA will 
extrapolate using the two end points.
It is important that the extropolation 
does not extend into the negative 
stress region.

Unloading is based on the interpolated Young’s 
moduli which must provide an unloading tangent 
that exceeds the loading tangent. σij

Figure M126-1.  Stress as a function of strain.  Note that the “yield stress” at a 
strain of zero is nonzero.  In the load curve deﬁnition the “ time” value is the 
directional strain and the “function” value is the yield stress.   Note that for 
element types 0 and 9 engineering strains are used, but for all other element 
types the rates are integrated in time. *.   
 ial behavior.  We introduce the parameters |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st) and |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st) as the hydro- 
static  and shear  limit stresses , respectively.  These are functions of the volumet ric 
strain and are assumed given by  
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠v ol ) = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠v ol )
|u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠v ol ) = |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠v ol )  , 
where we have reused the densiﬁcation function |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst.  The new parameters are 
the initial hydrostatic and shear limit stress valu es, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st and |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st, and are provid- 
ed by the user as GCAU and |ECC U |, respectively.  The negative sign of ECCU 
ﬂags the third yield surface option whenever LCA < 0.  The eﬀect of the third 
formulation is that (i) for a uniaxial stress the s tress limit is given by 
|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st(/u1D̅1∫, |u1D7≠≠v ol ), (ii) for a pressure the stress limit is given by |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st), and (iii) for a 
simple shear the stress limit is given by |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st).  Experiments have shown 
that the model may give noisy responses and inhomog eneous deformation 
modes if parameters are not chosen with care.  We t herefore recommend to (i) 
avoid large slopes in the function |u1D7≠∆|u1D443Cst, (ii) let the functions |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst and |u1D7≠∆|u1D464Cst be slightly 
increasing, and (iii) avoid large diﬀerences betwee n the stress limit values 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst(/u1Dℜ11, |u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st), |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st) and |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st). These guidelines are likely to contradict how 
one would interpret test data and it is up to the u ser to ﬁnd a reasonable trade-
oﬀ between matching experimental results and avoidi ng the mentioned nu- 
merical side eﬀects. 
4.  Stress Update for Fully Compacted Material.   As in the uncompacted case, 
we transform each element’s stresses and strain rat es into the local element 
coordinate system.  For fully compacted material (e lement formulations 1 and 
2), we assume that the material behavior is elastic -perfectly plastic and updat- 
ed the stress components according to: 
|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst trial = |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+ 2|u1D43A∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D451.st |u1D4J2Cst|u1D463Cst/u1D45B.sts+|oneCsts|twoCsts/fraction.v2
 
where the deviatoric strain increment is deﬁned as 
∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D451.st |u1D4J2Cst|u1D463Cst = ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst −1
3∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
We now check to see if the yield stress for the ful ly compacted material is ex- 
ceeded by comparing

tive trial stress exceeds the yield stress we simpl y scale back the stress compo- 
nents to the yield surface
