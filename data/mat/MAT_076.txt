 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCID Load curve ID for deviatoric relaxation behavior.  If LCID is 
given, constants |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst are determined using a least squares 
ﬁt.  See Figure M76-1  for an example relaxation curve. 
NT Number of terms in shear ﬁt.  If zero, the default is 6.  Fewer than 
NT terms will be used if the ﬁt produces one or mor e negative 
shear moduli.  Currently, the maximum number is set  to 18. 10n10n+110n+210n+3σ∕ε0

Figure M76-1.   Relaxation curves for deviatoric behavior and bulk beh avior.  
The ordinate of LCID is the deviatoric stress divided  by 2 times the constant 
value of deviatoric strain where the stress and strain are in the direction of the 
prescribed strain, or in non-di rectional terms, the eﬀective stress divided by 3 
times the eﬀective strain.  LCIDK deﬁnes the mean stre ss divided by the 
constant value of volumetric strain imposed in a hydros tatic stress relaxation 
experiment as a function of time.  For best results, the points deﬁned in the 
curve should be equally spaced on the logarithmic scal e.  Note the values for the 
abscissa are input as time, not log(time). Furthermore, the curve should be smooth 
and deﬁned in the positive quadrant.  If nonphysical value s are determined by 
least squares ﬁt, LS-DY NA will terminate with an error message after the 
initialization phase is completed.  If the ramp time for loading is included, then 
the relaxation which occurs during the loading phase i s taken into account.  
This eﬀect may or may not be important. *.

Prony Series cards.  Card Format for viscoelastic constants.  U p to 18 cards may be 
input.  If fewer than 18 cards are used, the next k eyword (“*”) card terminates this 
input.  These cards are not needed if relaxation da ta is deﬁned.  The number of terms 
for the shear behavior may diﬀer from that for the bulk behavi or: insert zero if a term is 
not included.  If an elastic layer is deﬁned you on ly need to deﬁne G i and K i (note in an 
elastic layer only one card is needed)
