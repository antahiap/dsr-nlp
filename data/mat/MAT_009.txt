LS-DYNA R13 2-167 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
PR Poisson’s ratio (used for null beams and shells only) 
Remarks: 
These remarks apply to solids and thick shells only . 
1.  Material Model.   When used with solids or thick shells, this mater ial must be 
used with an equation-of-state.  Pressure cutoﬀ is negative in tension.  A (devi- 
atoric) viscous stress of the form,  
|u1D7≠∆|minuteCst
|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = 2|u1D7≠7|u1D7≠≠|minuteCsṫ|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   ,  
is computed for nonzero |u1D7≠7, where |u1D7≠≠′̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  is the deviatoric strain rate and |u1D7≠7 is the 
dynamic viscosity.  Analyzing the dimensions of the  above equation gives 
units of the components in SI of 
|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|<racketriµhtCvJ~|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ |<racketleftCvJ1
|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ  . 
Therefore, |u1D7≠7 may have units of [Pa × s]. 
2.  Hourglass Control.   Null materials have no shear stiﬀness (except fro m 
viscosity) and hourglass control must be used with great care.  In some appli- 
cations, the default hourglass coeﬃcient may lead t o signiﬁcant energy losses.  
In general, for ﬂuids the hourglass coeﬃcient QM sh ould be small (in the range 
10 -6 to 10 -4), and the hourglass type IHQ should be set to 1 (d efault). 
3.  Yield Strength.   The Null material has no yield strength and behav es in a 
ﬂuid-like manner. 
4.  Cut-off Pressure.   The cut-oﬀ pressure, PC, must be deﬁned to allow for a 
material to “numerically” cavitate.  In other words , when a material undergoes 
dilatation above certain magnitude, it should no lo nger be able to resist this 
dilatation.  Since dilatation stress or pressure is  negative, setting the PC limit to 
a very small negative number would allow for the ma terial to cavitate once the 
pressure in the material goes below this negative v alue. *. ) for further  details.  Accurate results are 
to be expected only for the case where the EOS pres ents a linear relationship between 
the pressure and volumetric strain.
