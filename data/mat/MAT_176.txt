  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label n ot exceeding 8 
characters must be speciﬁed. 
RO Mass density 
K Bulk modulus 
LC1 Load curve ID that deﬁnes the relaxation function i n shear.  This 
curve is used to ﬁt the coeﬃcients G i and BETA i.  If zero, deﬁne 
the coeﬃcients directly.  The latter is recommended . 
LC2 Load curve ID that deﬁnes the instantaneous ela stic respon se in 
compression and tension.  If zero, deﬁne the coeﬃci ents directly.  
Symmetry is not assumed if only the tension side is  deﬁned; therefore, 
deﬁning the response in tension only, may lead to n onphysical behavior 
in compression.  Also, this curve sh ould give a softening response for 
increasing strain without any negative or zero slop es.  A stiﬀening 
curve or one with negative slopes is generally unst able.  
N Number of terms used in the Prony series which must  be less 
than or equal to 6. This number should be equal to the number of 
decades of time covered by the experimental data.  Deﬁne this 
number if LC1 is nonzero.  Carefully check the ﬁt i n the d3hsp  ﬁle 
to ensure that it is valid, since the least square ﬁt is not always 
reliable. 
GSTART Star ting value for least square ﬁt.  If zero, a default  value is set 
equal to the inverse of the largest time in the exp eriment.  Deﬁne 
this number if LC1 is nonzero. 
M Number of terms used to determine the instantaneous  elastic 
response.  This variable is ignored with the new formulation but 
is kept for compatibility with the previous input.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
Gi Coeﬃcients of the relaxation function.  The number of coeﬃcients 
is currently limited to 6 although 12 may be read i n to maintain 
compatibility with the previous formulation’s input .  Deﬁne these 
coeﬃcients if LC1 is set to zero.  At least 2 coeﬃc ients must be 
nonzero. 
BETA i Decay constants of the relaxation function.  Deﬁne these 
coeﬃcients if LC1 is set to zero.  The number of co eﬃcients is 
currently limited to 6 although 12 may be read in t o maintain 
compatibility with the previous formulation’s input .
