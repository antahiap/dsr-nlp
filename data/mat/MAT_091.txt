Material Formulation: 
The overall strain energy, /u1D44A, is "uncoupled" and includes two isotropic deviato ric 
matrix terms, a ﬁber term, |u1D439, and a bulk term: 
/u1D44A= |u1D436|oneCst|parenleftCv2/u1D4:C̃|oneCst− 3|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D436|twoCst|parenleftCv2/u1D4:C̃|twoCst− 3|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D439(|u1D7≠6) +1
2|u1D43∆[ln(/u1D4:D)]|twoCst 
Here, /u1D4:C̃|oneCst and /u1D4:C̃|twoCst are the deviatoric invariants of the right Cauchy deformation tensor, |u1D7≠6 is 
the deviatoric part of the stretch along the curren t ﬁber direction, and /u1D4:D= det /u1D405 is the 
volume ratio.  The material coeﬃcients |u1D436|oneCst and |u1D436|twoCst are the Mooney-Rivlin coeﬃcients, 
while |u1D43∆ is the eﬀective bulk modulus of the material (inpu t parameter XK). 
 
The derivatives of the ﬁber term |u1D439 are deﬁned to capture the behavior of crimped 
collagen.  The ﬁbers are assumed to be unable to re sist compressive loading - thus the 
model is isotropic when |u1D7≠6 < 1.   An exponential function describes the straighteni ng of 
the ﬁbers, while a linear function describes the be havior of the ﬁbers once they are 
straightened past a critical ﬁber stretch level |u1D7≠6 ≥ |u1D7≠6∗ (input parameter XLAM): *. -092  
 contacts and equilibrium is established.  For examp le, a ligament tissue "uncrimping 
strain" of 3% can be represented with initial stret ch value of 1.03. 
 
If the VISCO keyword option is includeed, at least one Prony series term (S1, T1) must 
be deﬁned. *
