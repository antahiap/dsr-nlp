AOPT C P VLCID  PB NLP  *. .  A related keyword is *CONTROL_FORMING_ST RAIN_RATIO_SMOOTH, 
which applies a smoothing algorithm to reduce outpu t noise level of the strain ratio |u1D6FD 
(in-plane minor strain increment/major strain incre ment) when calculating F.I. 
 
The NLP_FAILURE option uses eﬀective plastic strain  to calculate the onset of necking, 
which assumes the necking happens in an instant.  H owever, necking may occur over a 
longer duration which the option NLP2 is developed to address.  NLP2 calculates the 
damage during forming and accumulates it to predict  the sheet metal failure.
