This is  Material Type 29.  It is a force limited resultant formulation.  With this material 
model, for the Belytschko-Schwer beam only, plastic  hinge forming at the ends of a 
beam can be modeled using curve deﬁnitions.  Option ally, collapse can also be 
modeled.  See also *.

10 20  to prevent interaction) 
Remarks: 
1.  Load Curves.   This material model is available for the Belytsch ko resultant 
beam element only.  Plastic hinges form at the ends  of the beam when the mo- 
ment reaches the plastic moment.  The moment as a f unction rotation relation- 
ship is speciﬁed by the user in the form of a load curve and scale factor.  The 
points of the load curve are |parenleftCv1plastic rotation in radians, plastic moment|parenriµhtCv1 .  Both 
quantities should be positive for all points, with the ﬁrst point being 
|parenleftCv10.0, initial plastic moment|parenriµhtCv1 .  Within this constraint any form of characteristi c 
may be used, including ﬂat or falling curves.  Diﬀe rent load curves and scale 
factors may be speciﬁed at each node and about each  of the local |u1D46≠ and |u1D461 axes. 
Axial collapse occurs when the compressive axial lo ad reaches the collapse 
load.  Collapse load as a function of collapse deﬂe ction is speciﬁed in the form 
of a load curve.  The points of the load curve are either 
|parenleftCv1true strain, collapse force|parenriµhtCv1  or |parenleftCv1change in length, collapse force|parenriµhtCv1 .  Both quanti- *.

and similar conditions hold for |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cstupper  and |u1D44≠|u1D461Cstupper . 
Thereafter, the plastic moments will be given by 
|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JDCst= min(|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstupper , |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstcur v e ) 
where |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JDCsts is the current plastic moment and |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstcur v e  is the moment from the 
load curve at the current rotation scaled by the sc ale factor.  |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D4JDCstand |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst|u1D4JDCst satisfy 
similar conditions. M1M1M2M3M4M5M6M7M8

For an intermediate value of the end moment LS-DY NA interpolates between 
the curves to determine the allowable force value. *
