This is Material Type 179 (and 180 if the ORTHO opt ion below is active) for modeling 
rate independent low density foams, which have the property that the hysteresis in the 
loading-unloading curve is considerably reduced aft er the ﬁrst loading cycle.  For this 
material we assume that the loading-unloading curve  is identical after the ﬁrst cycle of 
loading is completed and that the damage is isotrop ic, that is, the behavior after the ﬁrst 
cycle of loading in the orthogonal directions also follows the second curve.  The main 
application at this time is to model the observed b ehavior in the compressible synthetic 
foams that are used in some bumper designs.  Tables  may be used in place of load 
curves to account for strain rate eﬀects. 
Available options include:

WITH_FAILURE 
ORTHO_WITH_FAILURE 
If the foam develops orthotropic behavior, that is,  after the ﬁrst loading and unloading 
cycle the material in the orthogonal directions are  unaﬀected, then the ORTHO option 
should be used.  If the ORTHO option is active the directionality of the loading is 
stored.  This option requires additional storage fo r history variables related to the 
orthogonality and is slightly more expensive. 
An optional failure criterion is included.  A descr iption of the failure model is provided 
below for material type 181, *.
