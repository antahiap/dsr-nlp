LS-DYNA R13 2-281 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
C300 |u1D436|threeCst|zeroCst|zeroCst , constant in strain energy functional .  If a least squares ﬁt is 
being used, set this constant to 1.0 if the term it belongs to in the 
strain energy functional is to be included.  See Re marks. 
C400 |u1D436|fourCst|zeroCst|zeroCst , constant in strain energy functional.  If a least squares ﬁt is 
being used, set this constant to 1.0 if the term it  belongs to in the 
strain energy functional is to be included.  See Re marks. 
C110 |u1D436|oneCst|oneCst|zeroCst , constant in strain energy functional .  If a least squares ﬁt is 
being used, set this constant to 1.0 if the term it  belongs to in the 
strain energy functional is to be included.  See Re marks. 
C210 |u1D436|twoCst|oneCst|zeroCst , constant in strain energy functional .  If a least squares ﬁt is 
being used, set this constant to 1.0 if the term it  belongs to in the 
strain energy functional is to be included.  See Re marks. 
C010 |u1D436|zeroCst|oneCst|zeroCst , constant in strain energy functional .  If a least squares ﬁt is 
being used, set this constant to 1.0 if the term it  belongs to in the 
strain energy functional is to be included.  See Re marks. 
C020 |u1D436|zeroCst|twoCst|zeroCst , constant in strain energy functional .  If a least squares ﬁt is 
bein g used, set this constant to 1.0 if the term it bel ongs to in the 
strain energy functional is to be included.  See Re marks. 
EXIT Exit option: 
EQ.0.0: stop if strain limits are exceeded (recommended) 
NE.0.0: continue if strain limits are exceeded.  The cur ve is 
then extrapolated. 
EMAX Maximum strain limit, (Green-St, Venant Strain ). 
EMIN Minimum strain limit, (Green-St, Venant Strain ). 
REF Use reference geometry to initialize the stress ten sor.  The 
reference geometry is deﬁned by the keyword: *INI-
TIAL_FOAM_REFERENCE_ GEOMETRY (see there for more 
details). 
EQ.0.0: oﬀ, 
EQ.1.0: on. 
SGL Specimen gauge length; see Figure M27-1 . 
SW Specimen width; see Figure M27-1 . *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-283 (MAT) see Figure M27-2  The least square ﬁt to the experimental data is pe rformed during the 
initialization phase, and a comparison between the ﬁt and the actual input is provided 
in the printed ﬁle.  It is a good idea to visually check the ﬁt to make sure it is acceptable.  
The coeﬃcients |u1D436|oneCst|zeroCst|zeroCst  through |u1D436|zeroCst|twoCst|zeroCst  are also printed in the output ﬁle. *
