This is Thermal Material Type 8. With this model, o rthotropic thermal properties that 
are dependent on temperature (and/or mechanical his tory variables) can be speciﬁed 
with load curves.  The properties must be deﬁned fo r the temperature (and/or history 
variable) range that the material will see in the a nalysis.
