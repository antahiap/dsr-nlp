LS-DYNA R13 2-269 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
IAFLC Axial force load curve option: 
EQ.0: axial load curves are force as a function of strain . 
EQ.1: axial load curves are force as a function of change in 
length. 
YTFLAG Flag to allow beam to yield in tension: 
EQ.0.0: beam does not yield in tension. 
EQ.1.0: beam can yield in tension. 
ASOFT Axial elastic softening factor applied once hinge h as formed.  
When a hinge has formed the stiﬀ ness is reduced by this factor.  If 
zero, this factor is ignored. 
M1, M2, 
…, M8 Applied end moment for force as a function of (stra in/change in 
length) curve.  At least one must be deﬁned.  A max imum of 8 
moments can be deﬁned.  The values should be in ascending 
order. 
LC1, LC2, 
…, LC8 Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning axial force 
(collapse load) as a function of strain/change in l ength (see 
AOPT) for the corresponding applied end moment.  De ﬁne the 
same number as end moments.  Each curve must contai n the 
same number of points. 
LPS1 Load curve ID for pl astic moment as a function of rotation about 
the |u1D46≠-axis at node 1.  If zero, this load curve is ignor ed. 
SFS1 Scale factor for plastic moment as a function of ro tation curve 
about the |u1D46≠-axis at node 1.  Default = 1.0. 
LPS2 Load curve ID for plastic moment as a function of r otation about 
the |u1D46≠-axis at node 2.  Default: LPS1. 
SFS2 Scale factor for plastic momen t as a function of  rotation curve 
about the |u1D46≠-axis at node 2.  Default: SFS1. 
YMS1 Yield moment about the |u1D46≠-axis at node 1 for interaction 
calculations (default set to 10 20  to prevent interaction). 
YMS2 Yield moment about |u1D46≠-axis at node 2 for intera ction calculations 
(default set to YMS1). *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-271 (MAT) ties should be entered as positive for all points a nd will be interpreted as com- 
pressive.  The ﬁrst point should be |parenleftCv10.0, initial collapse load|parenriµhtCv1 . 
The collapse load may vary with end moment as well as with deﬂections.  In 
this case several load-deﬂection curves are deﬁned,  each corresponding to a 
diﬀerent end moment.  Each load curve should have t he same number of 
points and the same deﬂection values.  The end mome nt is deﬁned as the aver- 
age of the absolute moments at each end of the beam  and is always positive. 
2.  Damping.   Stiﬀness-proportional damping may be added using the damping 
factor |u1D7≠6.  This is deﬁned as follows: 
|u1D7≠6 =2 ×/u1D̅0∫
|u1D714 
where /u1D̅0∫ is the damping factor at the reference frequency |u1D714 (in radians per sec- 
ond).  For example if 1% damping at 2Hz is required  
|u1D7≠6 =2 × 0.01 
2/u1D̅0B× 2= 0.0015 92  . 
If damping is used, a small timestep may be require d.  LS-DYNA does not 
check this, so to avoid instability it may be neces sary to control the timestep 
using a load curve.  As a guide, the timestep requi red for any given element is 
multiplied by 0.3/u1D4:F/u1D450|u1D7≠6 ⁄ when damping is present ( /u1D4:F = element length, /u1D450 = sound 
speed). 
3.  Moment Interaction.   Plastic hinges can form due to the combined actio n of 
moments about the three axes.  This facility is act ivated only when yield mo- 
ments are deﬁned in the material input.  A hinge fo rms when the following 
condition is ﬁrst satisﬁed: 
⎝⎜⎛|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst
|u1D44≠ryield ⎠⎟⎞|twoCst
+
⎝⎜⎛|u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst
|u1D44≠syield ⎠⎟⎞|twoCst
+
⎝⎜⎛|u1D44≠|u1D461Cst
|u1D44≠tyield ⎠⎟⎞|twoCst
≥ 1  , 
where 
|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst,  |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst,  |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst= current moment 
|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstyield , |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cstyield , |u1D44≠|u1D461Cstyield = yield moment  
Note that scale factors for hinge behavior deﬁned i n the input will also be ap- 
plied to the yield moments:  for example, |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cstyield  in the above formula is given 
by the input yield moment about the local axis time s the input scale factor for 
the local |u1D46≠ axis.  For strain-softening characteristics, the y ield moment should 
generally be set equal to the initial peak of the m oment-rotation load curve. 
On forming a hinge, upper limit moments are set.  T hese are given by *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-273 (MAT) The eﬀect of this is to provide an upper limit to t he moment that can be gener- 
ated; it represents the softening eﬀect of local bu ckling at a hinge site.  Thus if a 
member is bent about is local |u1D46≠-axis it will then be weaker in torsion and about 
its local |u1D461-axis.  For moment-softening curves, the eﬀect is t o trim oﬀ the initial 
peak (although if the curves subsequently harden, t he ﬁnal hardening will also 
be trimmed oﬀ). 
It is not possible to make the plastic moment vary with axial load. *. .  In addition to th e original plastic hinge and collapse
