 Card Summary: 
Cards 2 through 4 specify ﬁber orientation.  They m ay be overwritten with may be 
overwritten by *INITIAL_STRESS_(T)SHELL/SOLID. Card s 5 and 6 are for specifying 
parameters for the ﬁber/inclusion material.  Cards 7 through 9 give properties 
associated with the matrix material.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
NUMINT Number or percentage of failed integration points p rior to 
element deletion (default value is 1): 
GT.0.0: Number of integration points which must fail before  
element is deleted.  
LT.0.0: Applies only to shells. |N U MINT|  is the percentage of 
layers which must fail before an element fails.  Fo r shell 
formulations with 4 integration points per layer, t he 
layer is considered failed if any of the integratio n points 
in the layer fails.

For this material, “Plastic Strain” is the equivale nt plastic strain in the matrix. Extra 
history variables may be requested for (t)shell (NE IPS) and solid (NEIPH) elements 
with *DATABASE_EXTENT_BINARY. Extra history variabl es 1 through 8 are intended 
for post-processing while 9 through18 are intended for initialization with *INITIAL_-
STRESS_(T)SHELL/SOLID. They have the following mean ing:
