This is Material Type 134.  The viscoelastic fabric  model is a variation on the general 
viscoelastic model of material 76.  This model is v alid for 3 and 4 node membrane 
elements only and is strongly recommended for model ing isotropic viscoelastic fabrics 
where wrinkling may be a problem.  For thin fabrics , buckling can result in an inability 
to support compressive stresses; thus, a ﬂag is inc luded for this option.  If bending 
stresses are important use a shell formulation with  model 76.

LCID Load curve ID if constants, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst are determined using a least 
squares ﬁt.  See Figure M134-1 . 
NT Number of terms in shear ﬁt.  If zero, the default is 6. Currently, 
the maximum number is set to 6. 
BSTART In the ﬁt, |u1D6FD|oneCst is set to zero, |u1D6FD|twoCst is set to BSTART, |u1D6FD|threeCst is 10 times |u1D6FD|twoCst, 
|u1D6FD|fourCst is 10 times |u1D6FD|threeCst, and so on.  If zero, BSTART = 0.01.

|u1D6FD/u1Dℜ0⃡.st|twoCsts, |u1D6FD/u1Dℜ0⃡.st/four.sts is 10 times |u1D6FD/u1Dℜ0⃡.st|threeCsts, and so on.  If zero, BSTARTK = 0.01. 
TRAMPK Optional ramp time for bulk loading 
 *.   
 For an example of a stress relaxation curve see Figure M134-1 . This curve deﬁnes stress 
as a function of time where time is deﬁned on a log arithmic scale.  For best results, the 
points deﬁned in the load curve should be equally s paced on the logarithmic scale.  
Furthermore, the load curve should be smooth and de ﬁned in the positive quadrant.  If 
nonphysical values are determined by least squares ﬁt, LS-DYNA will terminate with 
an error message after the initialization phase is completed.  If the ramp time for 
loading is included, then the relaxation which occu rs during the loading phase is taken 
into account.  This eﬀect may or may not be importa nt. 10n10n+110n+210n+3σ∕ε0
