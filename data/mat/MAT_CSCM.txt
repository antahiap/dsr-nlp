3.  Plasticity Surface.   The three invariant yield function is based on th ese three 
invariants, and the cap hardening parameter, /u1D̅05, as follows: 
|u1D4J3 |parenleftCv1/u1D4:D|oneCst,/u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst,/u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst,/u1D̅05|parenriµhtCv1 =/u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst−ℜ|twoCst|u1D439/u1D45:.st|twoCst|u1D439|u1D4J≠Cst . 
Here |u1D439/f.st is the shear failure surface, |u1D439/c.st is the hardening cap, and ℜ is the Rubin 
three-invariant reduction factor.  The cap hardenin g parameter /u1D̅05  is the value 
of the pressure invariant at the intersection of th e cap and shear surfaces. 
Trial elastic stress invariants are temporarily upd ated using the trial elastic 
stress tensor, /u1D̅48|u1D447Cst.  These are denoted /u1D4:D|oneCst|u1D447Cst, /u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst|u1D447Cst, and /u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst|u1D447Cst.  Elastic stress states are 
modeled when |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv2/u1D4:D|oneCst|u1D447Cst,/u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst|u1D447Cst,/u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst|u1D447Cst,/u1D̅05|u1D447Cst|parenriµhtCv2 ≤ 0 .  Elastic-plastic stress states are modeled 
when |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv2/u1D4:D|oneCst|u1D447Cst,/u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst|u1D447Cst,/u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst|u1D447Cst,/u1D̅05|u1D447Cst|parenriµhtCv2 ≤ 0.   In this case, the plasticity algorithm returns th e 
stress state to the yield surface such that |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv2/u1D4:D|oneCst|u1D443Cst,/u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst|u1D443Cst,/u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst|u1D443Cst,/u1D̅05|u1D443Cst|parenriµhtCv2 = 0.   This is accom- 
plished by enforcing the plastic consistency condit ion with associated ﬂow. 
4.  Shear Failure Surface.   The strength of concrete is modeled by the shear 
surface in the tensile and low conﬁning pressure re gimes: 
|u1D439/u1D45:.st(/u1D4:D|oneCst) = |u1D6F+ − |u1D7≠6 exp|parenleftCv1−|u1D6FD/u1D4:D|oneCst|parenriµhtCv1 +/u1D̅0:/u1D4:D|oneCst  . 
Here the values of |u1D6F+, |u1D6FD, |u1D7≠6, and /u1D̅0: are selected by ﬁtting the model surface to 
strength measurements from triaxial compression (TX C) tests conducted on 
plain concrete cylinders.

 /u1D44B|zeroCst determines the pressure at which compaction initia tes in isotropic compres- 
sion. |u1D44J, combined with /u1D44B|zeroCst, determines the pressure at which compaction initi - 
ates in uniaxial strain. |u1D437|oneCst and |u1D437|twoCst determine the shape of the pressure-
volumetric strain curves.  /u1D44A determines the maximum plastic volume compac- 
tion. 
7.  Shear Hardening Surface.  In unconﬁned compression, the stress-strain 
behavior of concrete exhibits nonlinearity and dila tion prior to the peak.  Such 
behavior is modeled with an initial shear yield sur face, /u1D441|u1D43BCst|u1D439/f.st, which hardens 
until it coincides with the ultimate shear yield su rface, |u1D439/f.st. Two input parame- 
ters are required.  One parameter, /u1D441|u1D43BCst, initiates hardening by setting the loca- 
tion of the initial yield surface.  A second parame ter, |u1D436|u1D43BCst, determines the rate of 
hardening (amount of nonlinearity). 
8.  Damage.   Concrete exhibits softening in the tensile and lo w to moderate 
compressive regimes. 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /d.st= (1 − |u1D4J1)|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |vCst /p.st  
A scalar damage parameter, |u1D4J1, transforms the viscoplastic stress tensor without  
damage, denoted |u1D7≠∆v p , into the stress tensor with damage, denoted |u1D7≠∆d. Damage 
accumulation is based upon two distinct formulation s, which we call brittle 
damage and ductile damage.  The initial damage thre shold is coincident with 
the shear plasticity surface, so the threshold does  not have to be speciﬁed by 
the user. 
a)  Ductile Damage.   Ductile damage accumulates when the pressure, |u1D443, is 
compressive and an energy-type term, /u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst, exceeds the damage threshold, 
/u1D̅0F|zeroCst|u1D4J≠Cst. Ductile damage accumulation depends upon the tota l strain compo- 
nents, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , as follows: 
/u1D̅0F/c.st=  /radical.v51
2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   
The stress components, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  are the elasto-plastic stresses (with kinematic 
hardening) calculated before application of damage and rate eﬀects. 
b)  Brittle Damage.   Brittle damage accumulates when the pressure is t ensile 
and an energy-type term, /u1D̅0F|u1D461Cst, exceeds the damage threshold, /u1D̅0F|zeroCst|u1D461Cst.  Brittle 
damage accumulation depends upon the maximum princi pal strain, |u1D7≠≠max , 
as follows: 
/u1D̅0F|tCst=/radical.v2|u1D438|u1D7≠≠max |twoCst  . 
As damage accumulates, the damage parameter, |u1D4J1, increases from an initial 
value of zero, towards a maximum value of one, usin g the following formula- 
tions: *.   
 available as a user option.  An element erodes when  |u1D4J1 > 0.99 and the maxi- 
mum principal strain is greater than a user supplie d input value, ERODE − 1.0 . 
11.  Viscoplastic Rate Effects.   At each time step, the viscoplastic algorithm 
interpolates between the elastic trial stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /ε.st, and the inviscid stress (without 
rate eﬀects), |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /p.st, to set the viscoplastic stress (with rate eﬀects),  |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |vCst /p.st : 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |vCst /p.st = (1 − |u1D6F∆)|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /ε.st+ |u1D6F∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /p.st , 
where 
|u1D6F∆ =∆|u1D461/|u1D7≠2
1 + ∆|u1D461/|u1D7≠2  . 
This interpolation depends upon the eﬀective ﬂuidit y coeﬃcient, |u1D7≠2, and the 
time step, ∆|u1D461.  The eﬀective ﬂuidity coeﬃcient is internally cal culated from ﬁve 
user-supplied input parameters and interpolation eq uations:

|u1D7≠≠̇NT 
|u1D7≠2|u1D4J≠Cst=ETA0C 
|u1D7≠≠̇NC  
The input parameters are ETA0T   and NT for ﬁtting uniaxial tensile stress data, 
ETA0X and NC  for ﬁtting the uniaxial compressive stress data, an d SRATE  for 
ﬁtting shear stress data.  The eﬀective strain rate  is |u1D7≠≠̇. 
This viscoplastic model may predict substantial rat e eﬀects at high strain rates 
(|u1D7≠≠̇ > 100).  To limit rate eﬀects at high strain rates , the user may input overstress 
limits in tension OVERT and compression OVERC.  The se input ﬁelds limit 
calculation of the ﬂuidity parameter, as follows: 
if |u1D438|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D7≠2 > O V ER,  then |u1D7≠2 =|u1D4JA
|u1D438|u1D7≠≠̇  . 
Here |u1D4JA = OVERT when the pressure is tensile and |u1D4JA = OVERC when the pres- 
sure is compressive. 
The user has the option of increasing the fracture energy as a function of eﬀec- 
tive strain rate using the REPOW input parameter, a s follows: *
