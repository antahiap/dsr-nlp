  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
VPC Variable pressure cutoﬀ for hydrostatic tension as a fraction of 
pressure yield value.  If nonzero this will overrid e the pressure 
cutoﬀ value PC. 
TC Tension cutoﬀ for uniaxial tensile stress.  Default  is zero.  A 
nonzero value is recommended for better stability. 
VTC Variable tension cutoﬀ for uniaxial tensile stress as a fraction of 
the uniaxial compressive yield strength.  If nonzer o; this will 
override the tension cutoﬀ value TC. 
LCRATE Load curve ID giving a scale factor for the previou s yield curves, 
dependent upon the volumetric strain rate 
PR Poisson’s ratio, which applies to both elastic and plastic 
deformations.  It must be smaller then 0.5. 
KCON Stiﬀness coeﬃcient for contact interface stiﬀness.  If undeﬁned 
one- third of Young’s modulus, E, is used.  KCON is also  
considered in the elem ent time step calculation; therefore, large 
values may reduce the element time step size. 
ISFLG Flag for tensile response (active only if negative abscissa are 
present in load curve LCUYS): 
EQ.0: load curve abscissa in tensile region correspond to  
volumetric strain 
EQ.1: load curve abscissa in tensile region correspond to  
eﬀective strain (for large PR, when volumetric stra in 
vanishes) 
NCYCLE Number of cycles to determine the average volumetri c strain rate.  
NCYCLE is 1 by default (no smoothing) and cannot ex ceed 100. 
Remarks: 
1.  Volumetric Strain.   The logarithmic volumetric strain is deﬁned in te rms of 
the relative volume, |u1D449, as: 
|u1D6F∆ = −ln(|u1D449) 
If option ISFLG = 1 is used, the eﬀective strain is  deﬁned in the usual way: 
|u1D7≠≠eff =/radical.v52
