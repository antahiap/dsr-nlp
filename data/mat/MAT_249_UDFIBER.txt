Stress Calculation: 
In this model up to three distinct ﬁber families ar e considered.  We assume that there is 
no interaction between the families.  Thus, the res ulting stress tensor is the sum of the 
single ﬁber responses.  Each ﬁber response is the s um of an isotropic and a spatially 
transversely isotropic neo-Hookean stress contribut ion, /u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cst|iCst|sCst /o.st  and /u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cst|tCst /r.st , respectively. The 
implementation is based on the work of Bonet and Bu rton (1998), adapted by BMW for 
simulation of unidirectional fabrics (see reference s below).  
 
The isotropic stress tensor, /u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cstiso , depends on an isotropic shear modulus, |u1D7≠7, and an 
isotropic bulk modulus, |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst where:  
|u1D7≠7 =|u1D438|iCst|sCst /o.st 
2(1 +/u1D̅08) and |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst=|u1D438|iCst|sCst /o.st (/u1D̅08+ |u1D4JB|u1D4J6Cst/u1D̅08|twoCst)
2(1 +/u1D̅08). 
Here, the variable |u1D4JB|u1D4J6Cst denotes the ratio between stiﬀness orthogonally to  the ﬁbers and in 
ﬁber direction, that is, |u1D4JB|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D438|iCst|sCst /o.st /|u1D438|u1D4J6Cst.  |u1D438iso , /u1D̅08, and |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst are input parameters.  Using the left 
Cauchy-Green tensor, /u1D41B, the isotropic neo-Hookean model reads: 
/u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cst|iCst|sCst /o.st =|u1D7≠7
/u1D4:D(/u1D41B−/u1D408) + |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst(/u1D4:D− 1)/u1D408 . 
 
Based on the orientation angel |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst of the ith  ﬁber family, an initial ﬁber direction /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst is 
computed.  The deformation gradient, /u1D405, transforms the initial ﬁber conﬁguration to the 
current ﬁber conﬁguration as /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst=/u1D405 /u1D426 |u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst. This vector contains all necessary information 
on ﬁber elongation and reorientation.
