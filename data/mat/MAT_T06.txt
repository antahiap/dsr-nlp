LS-DYNA R13 3-23 (. , but the thermal conducti vity is assumed to be orthotropic.  
A maximum of 8 species and 8 chemical reactions can  be deﬁned.  The orthotropic 
thermal material properties of a ﬁnite element unde rgoing chemical reactions are 
calculated based on a mixture law consisting of tho se chemical species currently present 
in the element.  The dependence of the chemical rea ction rate on temperature is 
described by the Arrhenius equation.  Time step spl itting is used to couple the system 
of ordinary diﬀerential equations describing the ch emical reaction kinetics to the system 
of partial diﬀerential equations describing the diﬀ usion of heat.
