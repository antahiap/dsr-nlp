This is  Material Type 165.  This relatively simple model, b ased on a material model by 
Lemaitre and Chaboche [1990], is suited to model no nlinear kinematic hardening 
plasticity.  The model accounts for the nonlinear B auschinger eﬀect, cyclic hardening, 
and ratcheting.  Huang [2009] programmed this model  and provided it as a user 
subroutine.  It is a very cost eﬀective model and i s available for shell and solid elements.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
GAMMA Kinematic hardening parameter, |u1D6F∆ 
FS Failure strain for eroding elements 
Remarks: 
If the isotropic hardening modulus, /u1D4:B, is nonzero, the size of the surface increases as a 
function of the equivalent plastic strain, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCst+/u1D4:B|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst  . 
The rate of evolution of the kinematic component is  a function of the plastic strain rate: 
|u1D6F+̇= [|u1D436|u1D4JB − |u1D6F∆|u1D6F+]|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst  , 
where |u1D4JB is the ﬂow direction.  The term, |u1D6F∆|u1D6F+|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, introduces the nonlinearity into the 
evolution law, which becomes linear if the paramete r, |u1D6F∆, is set to zero. *
