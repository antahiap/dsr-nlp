1.  Material Model.   The stress update for this material follows the s tandard 
approach for hypo-elastoplasticity, using the Jauma nn rate for objectivity.  The 
rate of Cauchy stress /u1D6D4 can be expressed as 
/u1D6D4̇=/u1D402|parenleftCv2/u1D6C6̇−/u1D6C6̇|u1D447Cst−/u1D6C6̇|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 +/u1D402̇/u1D402−|oneCst/u1D6D4  , 
where /u1D402 is the temperature dependent isotropic elasticity tensor, /u1D6C6̇ is the rate-
of-deformation, /u1D6C6̇|u1D447Cst is the thermal strain rate, and /u1D6C6̇|u1D4JDCst is the plastic strain rate.  
The coeﬃcient of thermal expansion is deﬁned as the  instantaneous value.  
Thus, the thermal strain rate becomes 
/u1D6C6̇|u1D447Cst= |u1D6F+|u1D447̇/u1D408 
where |u1D6F+ is the temperature dependent thermal expansion coe ﬃcient, |u1D447̇ is the 
rate of temperature and /u1D408 is the identity tensor.  Associated von Mises plas ticity 
is adopted, resulting in  
/u1D6C6̇|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst3/u1D42C
2|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt 
where |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain rate, /u1D42C is the deviatoric stress tensor, and 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt is the von Mises eﬀective stress.  The last term a ccounts for stress changes 
due to change in stiﬀness with respect to temperatu re, using the total elastic 
strain deﬁned as /u1D6C6|u1D4J2Cst=/u1D402−|oneCst/u1D6D4.  As a way to intuitively understand this contribu - 
tion, the special case of small displacement elasti city neglecting everything but 
the temperature dependent elasticity parameters giv es 
/u1D6D4̇=|u1D4J1
|u1D4J1|u1D461 (/u1D402/u1D6C6)  , 
showing that the stress may change without any chan ge in strain. 
2.  Model Requirements and Restrictions.   At least two temperatures and their 
corresponding material properties must be deﬁned.  The analysis will be ter- 
minated if a material temperature falls outside the  range deﬁned in the input.  
If a thermo-elastic material is considered, do not deﬁne SIGY and ETAN.
