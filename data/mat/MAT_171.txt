Remarks: 
The brace element is intended to represent the buck ling, yielding and cyclic behavior of 
steel elements, such as tubes or I-sections, that c arry only axial loads.  A single beam 
element should be used to represent each structural  element.  Empirical relationships 
are used to determine the buckling and cyclic load- deﬂection behavior.  The cyclic 
behavior is shown in Figure M171-1  (compression shown as negative force and 
displacement).   
 
The initial buckling load (point 2) is: 
|u1D439|u1D44FCst/co⋯⋯a.st initial = FB U CK +FB U CK2 
/u1D4:F|twoCst  , 
where FBUCK and FBUCK2 are input parameters, and /u1D4:F is the length of the beam 
element.  If neither FBUCK nor FBUCK2 are deﬁned, t he default is that the initial 
buckling load is  
SIG Y × A, 
where |u1D434 is the cross sectional area.  The buckling curve ( shown dashed) has the form: 
|u1D439(|u1D4J1) =|u1D439b, initial 
/radical.v1|u1D434|u1D6FF + |u1D43J 
where |u1D6FF is |dividesCv1strain yield strain ⁄ |dividesCv1 , and |u1D434 and |u1D43J are internally calculated functions of 
slenderness ratio ( |u1D7≠6) and loading history. *.   
 reduction factor is typically in the range 0.6 to 1 .0 (smaller values for more slender 
members).  By default, CCBRF is calculated using SE AOC 1990: 
CCBRF =1
⎝⎜⎜⎜⎛1 +0.5|u1D7≠6
/u1D̅0B/radical.v5|u1D438
0.5|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst⎠⎟⎟⎟⎞ 
When tensile loading is applied after buckling, the  member must ﬁrst be straightened 
before the full tensile yield force can be develope d.  This is represented by a reduced 
unloading stiﬀness (such as segment 14-15) and the tensile reloading curve (segments 8-
9 and 15-16).  Further details can be found in Brun eau, Uang, and Whittaker [1998] and 
Structural Engineers Association of California [197 4, 1990, 1996]. 
 
 
The response of stocky (low  |u1D7≠6) and slender (high  |u1D7≠6) braces are compared in the graph.  
These diﬀerences are achieved by altering the input  value LAMDA (or the section 
properties of the beam) and FBUCK.
