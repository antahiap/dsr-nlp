speciﬁed (see *PART).

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
/u1D41A is determined by taking the cross product of /u1D42F with 
the normal vector, /u1D41B is determined by taking the cross 
product of the normal vector with /u1D41A, and /u1D41C is the nor- 
mal vector.  Then /u1D41A and /u1D41B are rotated about /u1D41C by an an- 
gle BETA. BE TA may be set in the keyword input for 
the element or in the input for this keyword.  Note  that 
for solids, the material axes may be switched depen d- 
ing on the choice of MACF. The switch may occur be-
fore or after applying BE TA depending on the value of 
MACF. 
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector, /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D443, deﬁning the centerline axis.  
This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE-_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR). 
The ﬁber orientation information may be overwritten  using *INI-
TIAL_STRESS_(T)SHELL/SOLID 
MACF Material axes change ﬂag for solid elements: 
EQ.-4: Switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450 before BETA rotation 
EQ.-3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450 before BETA rotation 
EQ.-2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F before BETA rotation  
EQ.1: No change, default 
EQ.2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F after BETA rotation 
EQ.3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450 after BETA rotation 
EQ.4: Switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450 after BETA rotation 
Figure M2-2  indicates when LS-DY NA applies MACF during the 
process to obtain the ﬁnal material axes.  If BETA on *ELE-
MENT_SOLID_ {OPTION}  is deﬁned, then that BE TA is used for 
the rotation for all AOPT options.  Otherwise, if A OPT = 3, the 
BETA input on Card 3 rotates the axes.  For all other values of 
AOPT, the material axes will be switched as speciﬁe d by MACF, 
but no BETA rotation will be performed.

LCIDT Load curve ID or table ID for deﬁning eﬀectiv e stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain in tension of matrix materi al 
(Table to include strain-rate eﬀects, viscoplastic formulation.) 
LCDI Curve/table for ductile d amage initiation parameter.  The 
deﬁnitions depend on if the element is a shell or s olid. 
Shell elements.  LC DI can be a load curve or table ID. A load 
curve represents plastic strain at onset of damage as function of 
stress triaxiality.  A table represents plastic str ain at onset of 
damage as function of stress triaxiality and plasti c strain rate. 
Solid elements.  LC DI can be a load curve, table, or 3D table ID. 
A load curve represents plastic strain at onset of damage as 
function of stress triaxiality.  A table represents  plastic strain at 
onset of damage as function of stress triaxiality a nd lode angle .  A 
3D table represents plastic strain at onset of dama ge as function 
of stress triaxiality, lode angle and plastic strai n rate.

Material Orientation: 
Figure 4 of Reference 13  shows the 2nd order orientation tensor for which t here are 
eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues.  The co ordinate system based on the 
eigenvectors is the material coordinate system.  Th e values /u1D45E|oneCst|oneCst ,…, /u1D45E|threeCst|threeCst  for solids (history 
variables 11 through 16) and the values cos (|u1D6F+ ) and - sin |u1D6F+  for shells (history variables 11 
and 12) specify this material coordinate system wit h respect to the element coordinate 
system. The values |u1D44∆|oneCst and |u1D44∆|twoCst (A11 and A22 of history variables 9 and 10) shown in the 
ﬁgure represent the eigenvalues, or in other words,  the lengths of the ellipsoid.  Thus.  
history variables 9 and 10 give the shape of the el lipsoid while history variables 11 
through 16 give the orientation.
