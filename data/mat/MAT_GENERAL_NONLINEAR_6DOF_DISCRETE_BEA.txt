The equation of state is a Mie-Gruneisen form with a polynomial Hugoniot curve and a 
|u1D4JD − |u1D6F+  compaction model.  First, we deﬁne a history varia ble representing the porosity |u1D6F+ 
that is initialised to |u1D6F+|zeroCst> 1. The evolution of this variable is given as 
|u1D6F+(|u1D461) = max

EOSID Equation of state ID. A unique number or label must  be

GAMMA, K0 Constants in the equation of state 
V0 Initial relative volume 
Remarks: 
The Murnaghan equation of state deﬁnes pressure as 
|u1D4JD =/u1D458|zeroCst|<racketleftCvJ|parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst|parenriµhtCvJ/u1D6FE.st
− 1|<racketriµhtCvJ  . 
To model ﬂuid ﬂows accurately, |u1D6F∆ is often set to 7, and /u1D458|zeroCst is chosen such that 
/u1D450|zeroCst=/radical.v5|u1D6F∆/u1D458|zeroCst
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst≥ 10|u1D463|mCst|aCst|xCst    , 
where |u1D463|mCst|aCst|xCst  is the maximum expected ﬂuid ﬂow velocity.  This w ill ensure low 
compressibility while allowing for a relatively lar ge time step size. *EOS  *EOS_USER_DEFINED

axis as a function of relative translational displa cement during 
unloading.  The force values deﬁned by this curve m ust increase 
monotonically from the most negative displacement t o the m ost 
positive displacement.  For IUNLD = 1.0, the slope of this curve 
must equal or exceed the loading curve for stabilit y reasons.  This 
is not the case for IUNLD = 2.0.   For loading and unloading to 
follow the same path simply set LCIDTUR = LCIDTR.  For 
options IUNLD = 0.0 or 3.0 the unloading curve is not required.  
For IUNLD = 2.0, if LCID TUR is left blank or zero, the default is 
to use the same curve for unloading as for loading.

entire family of springs to be modeled with a singl e material.  Note that all the
