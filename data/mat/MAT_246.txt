 3.  Layer Geometry.   The layer should form a cuboid box around the bou nded 
domain, with the axes of the box aligned with the c oordinate axes.  Various 
faces of this box may be open, as required by the g eometry of the problem.  For 
example, for a half-space problem, the “top” of the  box should be open. 
Internally, LS-DYNA will partition the entire PML i nto regions which form the 
“faces,” “edges” and “corners” of the above cuboid box and generate a new 
material for each region.  This partitioning will b e visible in the d3plot  ﬁle.  The 
user may safely ignore this partitioning. 
4.  Number of Elements in the Layer.   The layer should have 5 - 10 elements 
through its depth.  Typically, 5 - 6 elements are s uﬃcient if the excitation 
source is reasonably distant from the layer, and 8 - 10 elements if it is close.  
The size of the elements should be similar to that of elements in the bounded 
domain near the layer, and should be small enough t o suﬃciently discretize all 
signiﬁcant wavelengths in the problem. 
5.  Nodal Constraints.  The nodes on the outer boundary of the layer should  be 
fully constrained.  
6.  Stress and Strain.   The stress and strain values reported by this mat erial do 
not have any physical signiﬁcance. *
