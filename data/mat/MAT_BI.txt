 The stress and strain pairs in load curve LCPY shou ld be positive values start- 
ing with a volumetric strain value of zero. 
2.  LCUYS.   The load curve LCUYS can optionally contain the r esults of the 
tensile test (corresponding to negative values of t he volumetric strain); if it 
does, then the load curve information will override  PC, VPC, TC and VTC. 
This is the recommended approach, because the neces sary continuity between 
tensile and compressive regime becomes obvious (see  Figure M75-1 ). 
3.  Yield Surface.   The yield surface is deﬁned as an ellipse in the equivalent 
pressure and von Mises stress plane.  This ellipse is characterized by three 
points: 
a)  the hydrostatic compression limit (LCPY), 
b)  the uniaxial compression limit (LCUYS), and 
c)  either the pressure cutoﬀ for hydrostatic stress ( PC,VPC), the tension cut- 
oﬀ for uniaxial tension (TC,VTC), or the optional t ensile part of LCUYS. 
4.  High Frequency Oscillations.  To prevent high frequency oscillations in the 
strain rate from causing similar high frequency osc illations in the yield stress, a 
modiﬁed volumetric strain rate is used to obtain th e scaled yield stress.  The 
modiﬁed strain rate is obtained as follows.  If NYC LE is > 1, then the modiﬁed 
strain rate is obtained by a time average of the ac tual strain rate over NCYCLE 
solution cycles.  The averaged strain rate is store d in history variable #3. Volumetric Strain True Stress

This is  Material Type 232.  This is a Biot linear hystereti c material, to be used for 
modeling the nearly-frequency-independent viscoelas tic behavior of soils subjected to 
cyclic loading, such as in soil-structure interacti on analysis [Spanos and Tsavachidis 
(2001), Makris and Zhang (2000), Muscolini, Palmeri  and Ricciardelli (2005)].  The 
hysteretic damping coeﬃcient for the model is compu ted from a prescribed damping 
ratio by calibrating with an equivalent viscous dam ping model for a single-degree-of-
freedom system.  The damping increases the stiﬀness  of the model and thus reduces the 
computed time-step size.

Remarks: 
1.  Stress.   The stress is computed as a function of the strai n rate as 
|u1D7≠∆(|u1D461) =/integral.v:|u1D436|u1D44JCst(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D7≠≠̇(/u1D̅0F)|u1D461Cst
|zeroCst|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F  
where *. OT_HYSTERETIC  
 |u1D436|u1D44JCst(|u1D461) = |u1D436 |<racketleftCvJ1 +2|u1D7≠2
/u1D̅0B|u1D438|oneCst|parenleftCv1|u1D6FD|u1D461|parenriµhtCv1|<racketriµhtCvJ . 
In the above, |u1D436 is the elastic isotropic constitutive tensor, |u1D7≠2 is the hysteretic 
damping factor, and |u1D6FD = 2/u1D̅0B|u1D4J3/u1D451.st/10 , where |u1D4J3/u1D451.st is the dominant excitation frequen- 
cy in Hz.  The function |u1D438|oneCst is given by 
|u1D438|oneCst(|u1D46≠) =/integral.v:e−/u1Dℜ09.st
/u1D̅0∫|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0∫∞
|u1D46≠Cst 
For eﬃcient implementation, this function is approx imated by a 5-term Prony 
series as 
|u1D438|oneCst(|u1D46≠) ≈ |summationCv1 |u1D44F|u1D4J8Cste|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J8Csts|u1D46≠Cst|fiveCst
|u1D4J8Cst=|oneCst , 
such that |u1D44F|u1D4J8Cst> 0. 
2.  Hysteretic Damping Factor.   The hysteretic damping factor |u1D7≠2 is obtained 
from the prescribed damping ratio /u1Dℜ0D as  
|u1D7≠2 =/u1D̅0B /u1Dℜ0D/atan(10) = 2.14 /u1Dℜ0D 
by assuming that, for a single degree-of-freedom sy stem, the energy dissipated 
per cycle by the hysteretic material is the same as  that by a viscous damper, if 
the excitation frequency matches the natural freque ncy of the system. 
3.  Young’s Modulus.   The consistent Young’s modulus for this model is given by  
|u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst= |u1D438|<racketleftCvJ1 +2|u1D7≠2
/u1D̅0B|u1D4J4|<racketriµhtCvJ  , 
where 
|u1D4J4 = |summationCv1 |u1D44F|u1D4J8Cst1
|u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D6FD∆|u1D461|u1D4JBCst|<racketleftCv1exp|parenleftCv1|u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D6FD∆|u1D461|u1D4JBCst|parenriµhtCv1 − 1|<racketriµhtCv1|fiveCst
|u1D4J8Cst=|oneCst  . 
Because |u1D4J4 > 0 , the computed element time-step size is smaller th an that for the 
corresponding elastic element.  Furthermore, the ti me-step size computed at 
any time depends on the previous time-step size.  I t can be demonstrated that 
the new computed time-step size stays within a narr ow range of the previous 
time-step size and for a uniform mesh, converges to  a constant value.  For |u1D4J3/u1D451.st=
3.25 Hz and /u1Dℜ0D= 0.05 , the percentage decrease in time-step size can be expected 
to be about 12 - 15% for initial time-step sizes of  less than 0.02 secs, and about 
7 - 10% for initial time-step sizes larger than 0.0 2 secs.
