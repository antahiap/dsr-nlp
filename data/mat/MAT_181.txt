  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
G Shear modulus for frequency independent damping.  F requency 
independent damping is based on a spring and slider  in series.  
The critical stress for the slider mechanism is SIG F deﬁned below.  
For the best results, the value of G should be 250- 1000 times 
greater than SIGF. 
SIGF Limit stress for frequency independent, fricti onal, damping. 
REF Use reference geometry to initialize the stress ten sor.  The 
reference geometry is deﬁned by the keyword:*INITIA L_FOAM_-
REFERENCE_GEOMETRY (see there for more details). 
EQ.0.0: oﬀ, 
EQ.1.0: on. 
PRTEN The tensile Poisson’s ratio for shells (optio na l).  If PRTEN is zero, 
PR/BETA will serve as the Poisson’s ratio for both tension and 
compression in shells.  If PRTEN is nonzero, PR/BET A will serve 
only as the compressive Poisson’s ratio for shells.    
SGL Specimen gauge length 
SW Specimen width 
ST Specimen thickness 
LC/TBID Load curve ID or table ID, see *DEFINE_TA BLE, deﬁning the 
force versus actual change in the gauge length.  If  SGL, SW, and 
ST are set to unity (1.0), then curve LC is also en gineering stress 
versus engineering strain.  If the table deﬁnition is used, a family 
of curves is deﬁned for discrete s train rates.  The curves should 
cover the complete range of expected response, incl uding both 
compressive (negative values) and tensile (positive  values) 
regimes. 
TENSION Parameter that controls how the rate eﬀects are tre ated.  
Applicable to the table deﬁnition. 
EQ.-1.0: rate eﬀects are considered during tension and 
compression loading, but not during unloading, 
EQ.0.0: rate eﬀects are considered for compressive loading 
only, 
EQ.1.0: rate eﬀects are treated identically in tension and 
compression. *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
GAMA1 Material failure parameter, see equations bel ow and Figure 181.1.  
GAMA2 Material failure parameter, see equations bel ow. 
EH Damage parameter. 
LCUNLD Load curve, see *DEFINE_ CURVE, deﬁning the force versus 
actual length during unloading.  The unload curve s hould cover 
exactly the same range as LC or the load curves of TBID and its 
end points should have identical values, i.e., the combination of 
LC and LCUNLD or the ﬁrst cur ve of TBID and LCUNLD 
describes a complete cycle of loading and unloading .  See also

 /u1D4:C|threeCst= det(/u1D402) = |u1D7≠6|oneCst|twoCst |u1D7≠6|twoCst|twoCst |u1D7≠6|threeCst|twoCst 
with |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst are the stretch ratios in three principal directio ns. 
 
To avoid sudden failure and numerical diﬃculty, mat erial failure, which is usually a 
time point, is modeled as a process of damage growt h.  In this case, the two threshold 
values are chosen as (1 - h)K and  K, where h (also called EH) is a small number chosen 
based on experimental results reﬂecting the range b etween damage initiation and 
material failure. 
 
The damage is deﬁned as function of |u1D4J3: 
|u1D437 =
⎩|<raceleftCex|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex|<raceleftCex⎧
  0     if    |u1D4J3 ≤ (1 − ℎ)|u1D43∆
1
2|<racketleftCvJ 1 + cos /u1D̅0B(|u1D4J3 − |u1D43∆)
ℎ|u1D43∆|<racketriµhtCvJ    if    (1 −ℎ)|u1D43∆ < |u1D4J3 < |u1D43∆
1     if    |u1D4J3 ≥ |u1D43∆ 
This deﬁnition indicates that damage is ﬁrst-order continuous.  Under this deﬁnition, 
the tangent stiﬀness matrix will be continuous.  Th e reduced stress considering damage 
eﬀect is 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = (1 − |u1D437)|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D45C.st 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D45C.st is the undamaged stress.  It is assumed that prior  to ﬁnal failure, material 
damage is recoverable.  Once material failure occur s, damage will become permanent. 
 
The LOG_LOG_INTERPOLATION option interpolates the s train rate eﬀect in the table 
TBID using log-log interpolation. 
 
Bad choices of curves for the stress-strain respons e may lead to an unstable model, and 
there is an option to check this to a certain toler ance level, see dimensionless parameter 
STOL. The check is done by examining the eigenvalue s of the tangent modulus at 
selected stretch points and a warning message is is sued if an eigenvalue is less than –
STOL × BULK, where BULK indicates the bulk modulus of the  material.  For STOL < 0 
the check is disabled, otherwise it should be chose n with care, a too small value may 
detect instabilities that are insigniﬁcant in pract ice.  To avoid signiﬁcant instabilities it is 
recommended to use smooth curves, at best the curve s should be continuously 
diﬀerentiable, in fact for the incompressible case,  a suﬃcient condition for stability is 
that the stress-stretch curve |u1D446(|u1D7≠6)  can be written as 
|u1D446(|u1D7≠6) =/u1D4:B(|u1D7≠6) −/u1D4:B
⎝⎜⎛1
/radical.v1|u1D7≠6⎠⎟⎞
|u1D7≠6/radical.v1|u1D7≠6 
where /u1D4:B(|u1D7≠6) is a function with /u1D4:B(1) = 0  and /u1D4:B′(|u1D7≠6) > 0 .
