  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
INTFAIL The number of integration points required for the c ohesive 
element to be deleted.  If it is zero, the element won’t be deleted 
even if it satisﬁes the failure criterion.  The val ue of INT FAIL may 
range from 1 to 4, with 1 the recommended value. 
SIGMAX Peak traction. 
NLS Length scale (maximum separation) in the normal  direction. 
TLS Length scale (maximum separation) in the tangen tial direction. 
LAMDA1 Scaled distance to peak traction ( Λ1). 
LAMDA2 Scaled distance to beginning of softening ( Λ2). 
LAMDAF Scaled distance for failure ( Λfail ). 
STFSF Penetration stiﬀness multiplier.  The penetration s tiﬀness, PS , in 
terms of input parameters becomes: 
PS =STFSF × SIGMAX

This cohesive material model outputs three traction s having units of force per unit area 
into the D3PLOT database rather than the usual six stress components.  The in plane 
shear traction t1 along the 1-2 edge replaces the x-stress, the orth ogonal in plane shear 
traction t2 replaces the y-stress, and the traction in the nor mal direction t3  replaces the z-
stress. 
 
 
Used in XFEM, TLS corresponding to |u1D6FF|twoCst |u1D4J6|u1D4JB  above equations is replaced with TLS2. Since 
the initially rigid cohesive law is used, element f ails only when the stress level reaches 
the SIGMAX and Λ|oneCst is only used to deﬁne the penetration stiﬀness in case of crack 
closing (compression). *. ).

The following description of the model is for two d eformation/fracture modes (I and II) 
only, meaning without the option 3MODES. This is a natural choice for cohesive solid 
elements, where no speciﬁc distinction between in-p lane and out-of-plane shear can be 
made.  On the other hand, if this material model is  used with the cohesive shell element 
type ±29, shear deformation can clearly be separate d into in-plane shear (Mode II) and 
out-of-plane shear (Mode III).  This can be taken i nto account by adding 3MODES to the 
keyword and deﬁning additional Cards 4 and 5. Corre sponding equations including 
Mode III are not explicitly given here (for the sak e of brevity), but derivation of them is 
straightforward.  
 
The separations, ∆|u1D4JBCst and ∆|u1D461Cst, in the normal (peel) and tangential (shear) direc tions, 
respectively, are calculated from the element’s sep arations in the integration points, 
∆|u1D4JBCst= max (|u1D462|u1D4JBCst, 0) 
and 
∆|u1D461Cst=/radical.v2|u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst|twoCst+ |u1D462|u1D461Cst|twoCst|twoCst  . 
|u1D462|u1D4JBCst is the separation in the normal direction while |u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst and |u1D462|u1D461Cst|twoCst is the separation in both 
tangential directions of the element coordinate sys tem.  The total (mixed-mode) 
separation ∆|u1D4JACst is determined by 
∆|u1D4JACst=/radical.v2∆|u1D4JBCst|twoCst+ ∆|u1D461Cst|twoCst  . 
The initial stiﬀnesses in both modes are calculated  from the elastic Young’s and shear 
moduli and are respectively,
