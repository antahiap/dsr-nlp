this option active, EF1 is ignored.

DAF1 Load curve or table ID for damage parameter |u1D4J1|oneCst/u1D45:.stfor 1 st  ﬁber (see 
Remark 2 ). If a curve, DAF1 speciﬁes damage as a function o f 
ﬁber strain (for compression and elongation).  If D AF1 refers to a 
table, then tw o diﬀerent damage functions for tensile and 
compressive stresses are input.  The values in the table are 
arbitrary and exist only to index the two curves.  The ﬁrst indexed 
curve is assumed to specify tensile damage as a fun ction of ﬁber 
strains while s econd curve speciﬁes compressive damage as a 
function of ﬁber strains.  i nput different damage functions for 
tensile and compressive stresses.  Any other curves  input with the 
table definition are ignored.  
The damager parameter |u1D4J1|oneCst/u1D45:.st ranges from 0.0 for an undamaged 
ﬁber to 1.0 for a failed ﬁber family.  If all famil ies have failed, 
material failure at the integration point is initia ted.  
DAM1 Load curve or table ID for damage parameter |u1D4J1|oneCst|u1D4JACstfor matrix 
material based on the current deformation status of  the 1 st  ﬁber 
(see Remark 2 ). If a curve, it speciﬁes damage as a function of 
ﬁber strain (for compression and elongation).  If a  table, then the 
values are ﬁber strain rates which index damage as a function of 
ﬁber strain curves. 
The damager parameter |u1D4J1|oneCst|u1D4JACst ranges from 0.0 to 1.5. A value of 0.0 
indicates an undamaged matrix, whereas 1.0 refers t o a 
completely damaged matrix.  To initiate failure of the composite 
at the integration point, a matrix damage |u1D4J1|oneCst|u1D4JACst of 1.5 must be 
reached.  Naturally, the mechanical behavior of the  matrix does 
not change for damage values between 1.0 and 1.5.

to a completely damaged matrix.  To initiate failur e of the

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
GE.1:  Use *INITIAL_STRESS_ SHELL to initialize some 
material properties on an element-by-ele ment basis (see 
Remark 5  below). 
Remarks: 
1.  Stress Calculation.   This material features an additive split of the m atrix and 
reinforcement contributions to the stress.  Therefo re, the combined stress re- 
sponse, /u1D̅48, equals the sum  /u1D̅48|u1D4JACst+/u1D̅48/u1D45:.st. 
The matrix uses an elastic-plastic material formula tion with a von-Mises yield 
criterion.  This material supports a mixed hardenin g approach. 
We formulated the contribution of the ﬁber reinforc ement as a hyperelastic 
material.  Based on the orientation angle, |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst, of the ith  ﬁber family, LS-DYNA 
computes an initial ﬁber direction in the element c oordinate system /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst. By 
using the deformation gradient, /u1D405, the current ﬁber conﬁguration is given as 
/u1D426|iCst=/u1D405 /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst, containing all necessary information on ﬁber stra in and reorienta- 
tion.  Here, this vector is always orthogonal to th e shell normal and can, thus, 
be represented by the two in-plane vector component s. 
Following standard textbook mechanics for anisotrop ic and hyperelastic mate- 
rials, the elastic stresses within the ﬁbers due to  tension or compression are 
given as  
/u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/u1D45:.st= |summationCv1/u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst)|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst= |summationCv11
/u1D4:D|u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst)(/u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst)|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  , 
where the function |u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst of the ﬁber strain |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst corresponds to the load curve LCEF i. 
|u1D4JB is the number of ﬁber families. 
The shear behavior of the reinforcement can be cont rolled by METH ij.  For val- 
ues less than 10, the behavior is again standard te xtbook mechanics: 
/u1D̅48/u1D446.st/u1D45:.st= |summationCv1/u1D̅48/u1D446.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst/u1D45:.st|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst= |summationCv11
/u1D4:D|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst(/u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst)(/u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst+|oneCst)|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
Here /u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst represents the employed shear measure (scalar prod uct or shear 
angle in radians).  In general, the dyadic product /u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst+|oneCst does not deﬁne a 
shear stress tensor.  This formulation might result  in unphysical shear behavior 
in the case of woven fabrics.  Therefore, we devise d METH ij  = 10 and 11 to 
always give a pure shear stress tensor, /u1D̅48/u1D446.st/u1D45:.st.  *.   
 Matrix failure ( |u1D4J1|u1D4JACst= 1.0 ) does not necessarily initiate failure of the comp osite 
material.  In this implementation, matrix damage pa rameters |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JACst and |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst|u1D4JACst that 
exceed a value of 1.0 are admissible.  Failure of t he composite is initiated as 
soon as the damage parameter reaches 1.5. To accoun t for this delayed failure, 
the degradation of the matrix stresses is given by:  
/u1D̅48/circum⨂lexcmb.h1|u1D4JACst= |parenleftCv21 − min |parenleftCv11.0, |u1D4J1|u1D4JACst|parenriµhtCv1|parenriµhtCv2/u1D̅48|u1D4JACst  . 
3.  Fiber Viscosity.   Input parameter VISC activates ﬁber viscosity.  Thi s feature 
adds numerical damping to the post-damage behavior of the material.  Damp- 
ing might be necessary since brittle ﬁber failure t ends to induce shockwaves 
through the material, resulting in oscillations or even unphysical damage 
propagation.  
If activated, an additional viscous stress term is added to the ﬁber contribution: 
/u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D463Cst/u1D45:.st= |summationCv11
/u1D4:D⎝⎜⎛/integral.v:|u1D4J3|u1D463Cst(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D71J|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst(/u1D̅0F)

|zeroCst|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F 
⎠⎟⎞(/u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst)|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
The relaxation function, |u1D4J3|u1D463Cst, is represented by up to four terms of the Prony 
series expansions and thus reads 
|u1D4J3|u1D463Cst(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J8Csts|u1D461Cst
|u1D4J8Cst 
with relaxation moduli |u1D43A|u1D4J8Cst and decay constants |u1D6FD|u1D4J8Cst. 
4.  History Data.   This material formulation outputs to d3plot  additional data for 
post-processing to the set of history variables if requested.  The parameter 
POSTV speciﬁes the data to be written.  Its value i s calculated as 
POST V = |u1D44∆|oneCst+ 2 |u1D44∆|twoCst+ 4 |u1D44∆|threeCst+8 |u1D44∆|fourCst+ 16 |u1D44∆|fiveCst+ 32 |u1D44∆|sixCst+ 64 |u1D44∆|sevenCst. 
Each ﬂag  |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary number (can be either 1 or 0) and corr esponds to one 
particular type of post-processing variable accordi ng to the following table.

 5.  Description of IHIS.   Some material data can be initialized on an element -by-
element basis through history variables deﬁned with  *INITIAL_STRESS_-
SHELL starting at position HISV5.   
How the data is interpreted depends on the paramete r IHIS. Following the 
same concept as for parameter POSTV, the value of I HIS is computed by the 
following expression: 
I H IS = |u1D44∆|oneCst+ 2 |u1D44∆|twoCst 
Each ﬂag  |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary number (can be either 1 or 0) and corr esponds to one 
particular type of material variable.  So far, the only material variables imple- 
mented are ﬁber orientation in two diﬀerent coordin ate systems, global and 
material.  Thus, at most one of the ﬂags |u1D44∆|oneCst and |u1D44∆|twoCst should be set to 1.
