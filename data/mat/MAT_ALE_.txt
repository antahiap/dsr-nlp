MULO Dynamic viscosity (see Remark 1 ): 
EQ.0.0:  inviscid ﬂuid is assumed. 
GT.0.0:  if MUHI = 0.0 or is not deﬁned, then this is the 
traditional constant dynamic viscosity coeﬃcient, |u1D7≠7.

this case MULO is a parameter for the subroutine.

deﬁned only if RK and RN are deﬁned for the variabl e 
viscosity case. 
RK Variable dynamic viscosity multiplier.  See Remark 6 . 
RN Variable dynamic viscosity exponent.  See Remark 6 . 
Remarks: 
1.  Deviatoric Viscous Stress.   The null material must be used with an equation-
of-state.  Pressure cutoﬀ is negative in tension.  A (deviatoric) viscous stress of 
the form 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst= 2|u1D7≠7|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst 
|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|<racketriµhtCvJ~|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ |<racketleftCvJ1
|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ 
is computed for nonzero |u1D7≠7 where |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst is the deviatoric strain rate.  |u1D7≠7 is the dy- 
namic viscosity.  For example, in SI unit system, |u1D7≠7 has a unit of [Pa × s] . 
2.  Hourglass Control Issues.   The null material has no shear stiﬀness and 
hourglass control must be used with care.  In some applications, the default 
hourglass coeﬃcient might lead to signiﬁcant energy  losses.  In general for 
ﬂuid(s), the hourglass coeﬃcient QM should be small  (in the range 10 -4 to 10 -6 
for the standard default IHQ choice). 
3.  Null Material Properties.   Null material has no yield strength and behaves i n 
a ﬂuid-like manner. 
4.  Numerical Cavitation.   The pressure cut-oﬀ, PC, must be deﬁned to allow for 
a material to “numerically” cavitate.  In other wor ds, when a material under- 
goes dilatation above certain magnitude, it should no longer be able to resist 
this dilatation.  Since dilatation stress or pressu re is negative, setting PC limit 
to a very small negative number would allow for the  material to cavitate once 
the pressure in the material goes below this negati ve value. 
5.  Issues with Small Values of Viscosity Exponent.   If the viscosity exponent is 
less than 1.0 ( RN < 1.0 ), then RN − 1.0 < 0.0.   In this case, at very low equiva- 
lent strain rate, the viscosity can be artiﬁcially very high.  MULO is then used 
as the viscosity value. *. 03  
 6.  Empirical Dynamic Viscosity.   The empirical variable dynamic viscosity is 
typically modeled as a function of equivalent shear rate  based on experimental 
data. 
µ|parenleftCv1|u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ|minuteCst|parenriµhtCv1 = RK × |u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ|minuteCst(RN−|oneCst) 
For an incompressible ﬂuid, this may be written equ ivalently as 
µ|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅̇|minuteCst|parenriµhtCv1 = RK × |u1D7≠≠̅̇|minuteCst(RN−|oneCst) 
The “overbar” denotes a scalar equivalence.  The “d ot” denotes a time deriva- 
tive or rate eﬀect.  And the “prime” symbol denotes  deviatoric or volume pre- 
serving components.  The equivalent shear rate  components may be related to 
the basic deﬁnition of (small-strain) strain rate c omponents as follows: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =1

|u1D6F∆̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = 2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
Typically, the 2 nd  invariant of the deviatoric strain rate tensor is deﬁned as: 
/u1D4:C|twoCst|u1D7≠≠Cst̅̇/⋯inute.sts=1

The equivalent (small-strain) deviatoric strain rat e is deﬁned as:

In non-Newtonian literatures, the  equivalent shear rate  is sometimes deﬁned as  
|u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ≡/radical.v5|u1D6F∆̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D6F∆̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst

It turns out that, (a) for incompressible materials  ( |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst = 0), and (b) the shear 
terms are equivalent when |u1D4J6 ≠/u1D45̅→ |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst, the equivalent shear rate  is algebrai- 
cally equivalent to the equivalent (small-strain) deviatoric strain rate .

are lower and upper viscosity limit values for a po wer-

4.  If MULO is negative (for example, MULO = - 1), then a 
user-input data load curve (with LCID = 1) deﬁning dy- 
namic viscosity as a function of equivalent strain rate is 
used.

Remarks: 
1.  Viscous Stress.   The null material must be used with an equation-o f-state.  
Pressure cutoﬀ is negative in tension.  A (deviator ic) viscous stress of the form 
|u1D7≠∆′|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = 2|u1D7≠7|u1D7≠≠′̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst

|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ 
is computed for nonzero |u1D7≠7 where |u1D7≠≠′̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  is the deviatoric strain rate.  |u1D7≠7 is the dy- 
namic viscosity.  For example, in SI unit system, |u1D7≠7 has a unit of [Pa-s]. 
2.  Hourglass Control.   The null material has no shear stiﬀness and hourg lass 
control must be used with care.  In some applicatio ns, the default hourglass 
coeﬃcient might lead to signiﬁcant energy losses.  In general for ﬂuid(s), the 
hourglass coeﬃcient QM should be small (in the rang e of 10 -4 to 10 -6 for the 
standard default IHQ choice). 
3.  Yield Strength.   Null material has no yield strength and behaves i n a ﬂuid-like 
manner. 
4.  Pressure Cut-Off.   The pressure cut-oﬀ, PC, must be deﬁned to allow for a 
material to “numerically” cavitate.  In other words , when a material undergoes 
dilatation above certain magnitude, it should no lo nger be able to resist this *. HERSCHEL  
 dilatation.  Since dilatation stress or pressure is  negative, setting PC limit to a 
very small negative number would allow for the mate rial to cavitate once the 
pressure in the material goes below this negative v alue. 
5.  Viscosity.   If the viscosity exponent is less than 1.0, |u1D44J /u1D441 < 1.0 , then |u1D44J /u1D441 − 1.0 <
0.0.  In this case, at very low equivalent strain rate , the viscosity can be artiﬁ- 
cially very high.  MULO is then used as the viscosi ty value. 
6.  Herschel-Buckley Model.   The Herschel-Buckley model employs a large 
viscosity to model the “rigid-like” behavior for lo w shear strain rates ( |u1D6F∆̇< |u1D6F∆̇|u1D4J≠Cst).
