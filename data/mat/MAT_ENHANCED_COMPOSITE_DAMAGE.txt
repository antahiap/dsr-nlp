These are  Material Types 54 - 55 which are enhanced versions of the composite model 
material type 22.  Arbitrary orthotropic materials,  such as unidirectional layers in 
composite shell structures, can be deﬁned.  Optiona lly, various types of failure can be 
speciﬁed following either the suggestions of [Chang  and Chang 1987b] or [Tsai and Wu 
1971].  In addition, special measures are taken for  failure under compression.  See 
[Matzenmiller and Schweizerhof 1991]. 
By using the user deﬁned integration rule, see *INT EGRATION_SHELL, the 
constitutive constants can vary through the shell t hickness.  For all shells, except the 
DKT formulation, laminated shell theory can be acti vated to properly model the 
transverse shear deformation.  Lamination theory is  applied to correct for the 
assumption of a uniform constant shear strain throu gh the thickness of the shell. 
For sandwich shells where the outer layers are much  stiﬀer than the inner layers, the 
response will tend to be too stiﬀ unless lamination  theory is used.  To turn on 
lamination theory, see *CONTROL_SHELL. A damage mod el for transverse shear strain 
to model interlaminar shear failure is available.  The deﬁnition of minimum stress limits 
is available for thin/thick shells and solids.

elements only.  
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR. 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotro pic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle (MANGLE) from a line in the plane of the e l- 
ement deﬁned by the cross product of the vector, /u1D42F, 
with the element normal. 
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D4JD, which deﬁne the centerline ax- 
is.  This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordina te system ID 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR).   
2WAY Flag to turn on 2-way ﬁber action: 
EQ.0.0: Standard unidirectional behavior, meaning ﬁbers run  
only in the |u1D44∆-direction 
EQ.1.0: 2-way ﬁber behavior, meaning ﬁbers run in both the |u1D44∆-
and |u1D44F-directions.  The meaning of the ﬁelds DFAILT, 
DFAILC, YC, YT, SLIMT2 and SLIM C2 are altered if 
this ﬂag is set.  This option is only available for  *.   *.

2-404 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
SOFT Softening reduction factor for material strength in  crashfront 
elements (default = 1.0).  TFAIL must be greater than zero to 
activate this option.  Crashfront elements are elem ents that are 
direct neighbors of failed (deleted) elements. 
FBRT Softening for ﬁber tensile strength: 
EQ.0.0: Tensile strength = XT  
GT.0.0: Tensile strength = XT, reduced to XT × FBRT after 
failure has occurred in compressive matrix mode

2-412 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 4.  Failure/Damage Status.   The status in each layer (integration point) and 
element can be plotted using additional integration  point history variables.  
The number of additional integration point history variables for shells written 
to the LS-DYNA database is input by the *DATABASE_E XTENT_BINARY 
deﬁnition as variable NEIPS.  For Models 54 and 55 these additional history 
variables are tabulated below ( i = shell integration point): 
 
History 
Variable  Description Value 
1 ef( i) tensile ﬁber mode 
1 – elastic 
 
0 – failed 2 ec( i) compressive ﬁber mode 
3 em( i) tensile (shear for 2WAY) matrix mode  
4 ed( i) compressive matrix mode 
5 efail max[ef(ip)] 
6 dam damage parameter −1 – element intact 
10 −/eight.st – element in crashfront 
1 – element failed 
The variables in the table above are labeled by LS- PrePost simply as history 
variables 1 to 6.   
The three element history variables in the table be low, which represent the 
fraction of elastic (non-failed) integration points  in tensile ﬁber, compressive 
ﬁber, and tensile matrix modes, resp., are labeled as “eﬀective plastic strain” by 
LS-PrePost for integration points 1, 2, and 3.
