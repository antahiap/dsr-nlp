AOPT Material axes option, see Figure M2-1 : 
EQ.0.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes as shown in Figure M2-1 .  Nodes 1, 2, 
and 4 of an element are identical to the nodes used  for 
the deﬁnition of a coordinate system as by *DEFINE_ -
COORDINATE_ NODES, and then rotated about the 
shell element normal by an angle BETA. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR. 
EQ.3.0: Locally ortho tropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector, /u1D42F, with the 
element normal. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT i s a coordinate system ID 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR).   *
