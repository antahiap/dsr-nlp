  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
ROT Option for two-dimensional solids (shell elemen t forms 13, 14, or 
15): 
EQ.0.0: no rotation of material axes (default).  Direction o f 
material axes are solely deﬁned by AOPT.  I t is only 
possible to rotate in shell-plane.  
EQ.1.0: rotate coordinate system around material 1- axis such 
that 2-axis coincides with shell normal.  This rota ti on is 
done in addition to AOPT. 
EQ.2.0: Rotate coordinate system around material 2- axis such 
that 1- axis coincides with shell normal.  This rotation is  
done in addition to AOPT.

1.  Hardening Function.   Each hardening function, /u1D45E|u1D4J6Cst (note that /u1D45E|sixCst=/u1D45E|threeCst), is given 
by a load curve if |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst< 0, otherwise

2.  Material Model for Solid Elements.   The stress-strain relationship for solid 
elements is based on a multiplicative split of the deformation gradient into an 
elastic and a plastic part 
/u1D405=/u1D405|u1D4J2Cst/u1D405|u1D4JDCst  . 
The elastic Green strain is formed as 
/u1D404|u1D4J2Cst=1
2|parenleftCv2/u1D405|u1D4J2Cst/ε.st/u1D405|u1D4J2Cst−/u1D408|parenriµhtCv2  , 
and the 2 nd  Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress as 
/u1D412=/u1D402/u1D404|u1D4J2Cst  , 
where the constitutive matrix is taken as orthotrop ic and can be represented in 
Voigt notation by its inverse as

Three yield surfaces are present: in-plane, out-of- plane, and transverse shear.  
The in-plane yield surface is given as (see Remark 1 )

sion of the velocity gradient is appropriately norm alized. 
3.  Material Model for Shell Elements.  The stress-strain relationship for shell 
elements is based on an additive split of the rate of deformation into an elastic 
and a plastic part 
/u1D40:=/u1D40:|u1D4J2Cst+/u1D40:|u1D4JDCst  , 
and the rate of Cauchy stress is given by 
/u1D6D4̇=/u1D402/u1D40:|u1D4J2Cst  . 
In out-of-plane compression the stress rate is modi ﬁed according to 
|u1D7≠∆̇|threeCst|threeCst = |u1D436|threeCst|oneCst |u1D437|oneCst|oneCst |u1D4J2Cst+ |u1D436|threeCst|twoCst |u1D437|twoCst|twoCst |u1D4J2Cst+ |u1D437|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4J2Cst|<raceleftCvJ|u1D438|threeCst, |u1D7≠≠|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4J2Cst≥ 0

For shell elements, |u1D437|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4JDCst= 0, and only two yield surfaces are present: the in-
plane yield surface (see Remark 1 ),  
|u1D4J3 = |summationCv1
⎣⎢⎡max(0, |u1D7≠∆:/u1D441|u1D4J6Cst)
/u1D45E|u1D4J6Cst|parenleftCv3|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/u1D45:.st|parenriµhtCv3 ⎦⎥⎤|twoCst|u1D4J8Cst

and the transverse-shear yield surface, 
ℎ=/radical.v2|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|threeCst |twoCst+ |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|threeCst |twoCst

For this case, the plastic ﬂow rule is given by 
/u1D6C6̇|u1D4JDCst=/u1D40:|u1D4JDCst=/u1D40B|u1D4JDCst  , 
where the plastic velocity gradient is given as 
/u1D40B|u1D4JDCst=
