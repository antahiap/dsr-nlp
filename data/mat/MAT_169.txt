 2.  Bond Stiffness and Strength.   In-plane stresses are set to zero: it is assumed 
that the stiﬀness and strength of the substrate is large compared with that of 
the adhesive, given the relative thicknesses. 
If the substrate is modeled with shell elements, it  is expected that these will lie 
at the mid-surface of the substrate geometry.  Ther efore, the solid elements 
representing the adhesive will be thicker than the actual bond.  If the elastic 
compliance of the bond is signiﬁcant, this can be c orrected by increasing the 
elastic stiﬀness property |u1D438. 
3.  Stress and Failure.   The yield and failure surfaces are treated as a p ower-law 
combination of direct tension and shear across the bond: 
|parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆
|u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst|xCst |parenriµhtCvJPWRT 
    + |parenleftCvJ/u1D̅0F
/u1D̅0F|mCst|aCst|xCst − SH T _SL × |u1D7≠∆|parenriµhtCvJPWRS 
    = 1.0 
At yield SHT_SL is the slope of the yield surface a t |u1D7≠∆ = 0 .  See Figure M169-1 . 
The stress-displacement curves for tension and shea r are shown in Figure 
M169-2 . In both cases, GC is the area under the curve.  T he displacement to 
failure in tension is given by 
|u1D4J1ft = 2 |parenleftCvJGCTEN 
TENMAX |parenriµhtCvJ   , 
subject to a lower limit 
|u1D4J1ft, min = |parenleftCvJ2/u1D4:F|zeroCst
|u1D438|minuteCst|parenriµhtCvJ TENMAX  , 
where /u1D4:F|zeroCst is the initial element thickness (or BTHK if used)  and 
|u1D438|minuteCst=|u1D438(1 −/u1D̅08)
(1 − 2/u1D̅08)(1 +/u1D̅08)   . 
If GCTEN is input such that |u1D4J1ft < |u1D4J1ft, min , LS-DYNA will automatically increase 
GCTEN to make |u1D4J1ft = |u1D4J1ft, min .  Therefore, GCTEN has a minimum value of SHT_SL > 0
