This is Material Type 70.  This special purpose ele ment represents a combined hydraulic 
and gas-ﬁlled damper which has a variable oriﬁce co eﬃcient.  A schematic of the 
damper is shown in Figure M70-1 .  Dampers of this type are sometimes used on buﬀer s 
at the end of railroad tracks and as aircraft under carriage shock absorbers.  This 
material can be used only as a discrete beam elemen t.  See also the remarks below.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
hydraulic force only and is applied when unloading.   It is 
intended to represent a valve that opens when the p iston unloads 
to relieve hydraulic pressure.  Set it to 1.0 for n o such relief. 
SCLF Scale factor on force (default = 1.0). 
CLEAR Clearance.  If nonzero, no tensile force develops f or positive 
displacements and negative forces develop only afte r the 
clearance is closed. 
Remarks: 
As the damper is compressed two actions contribute to the force which develops.  First, 
the gas is adiabatically compressed into a smaller volume.  Secondly, oil is forced 
through an oriﬁce.  A proﬁled pin may occupy some o f the cross-sectional area of the 
oriﬁce; thus, the oriﬁce area available for the oil  varies with the stroke.  The force is 
assumed proportional to the square of the velocity and inversely proportional to the 
available area. 
The equation for this element is:
