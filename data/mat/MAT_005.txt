EPS1, … Volumetric strain values in pressure as a function of volumetric 
strain curve (see Remarks below).  A maximum of 10 values 
including 0.0 are allowed and a minimum of 2 values  are 
necessary.  If EPS1 is not 0.0, then a point (0.0, 0.0)  will be 
automatically generated and a maximum of nine value s may be 
input. 
P1, P2, …, PN Pressures corresponding to volumetric strain values  given on 
Cards 3 and 4. 
Remarks: 
1.  Variable Deﬁnitions.  Pressure is positive in compression.  Volumetric st rain is 
given by the natural log of the relative volume and  is negative in compression.  
Relative volume is a ratio of the current volume to  the initial volume at the 
start of the calculation.  The tabulated data shoul d be given in order of increas- 
ing compression.  If the pressure drops below the c utoﬀ value speciﬁed, it is 
reset to that value.  For a detailed description we  refer to Kreig [1972]. The bulk unloading modulus is used
if the volumetric crushing option is on 
(VCR = 0).  In thiscase the aterial's response
follows the black arrows.Loading and unloading (along the grey
arows) follows the input curve when the
volumetric crushing option is off (VCR = 1.0)
