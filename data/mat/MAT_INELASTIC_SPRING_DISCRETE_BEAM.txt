2.  Yield Force Curve.  Unless the origin of the curve starts at (0,0) , the negative 
part of the curve is used when the spring force is negative where the negative 
of the plastic displacement is used to interpolate,  |u1D439|u1D466Cst.  The positive part of the 
curve is used whenever the force is positive.  In t hese equations, ∆/u1D4:F is the 
change in length 
∆/u1D4:F= current  length - initial  length  . 
3.  Cross-Sectional Area.   The cross-sectional area is deﬁned on the section  card 
for the discrete beam elements, See *SECTION_BEAM.  The square root of this 
area is used as the contact thickness oﬀset if thes e elements are included in the 
contact treatment. *.  a bove (type 94).  
Generally, these referenced parts are used only for  the deﬁnition of this material model 
and are not referenced by any elements.  The two no des deﬁning a beam may be 
coincident to give a zero length beam, or oﬀset to give a ﬁnite length beam.  For ﬁnite 
length discrete beams, the absolute value of the va riable SCOOR in the *SECTION_-
BEAM input should be set to a value of 2.0, which c auses the local |u1D4JF-axis to be aligned 
along the two nodes of the beam, to give physically  correct behavior.  The distance 
between the nodes of a beam should not aﬀect the be havior of this material model.  A 
triad must be used to orient the beam for zero leng th beams.

TPIDR Translational motion in the local |u1D4JF-direction is governed by part 
ID TPIDR . If zero, no force is computed in this direction. 
TPIDS Translational motion in the local |u1D46≠-direction is governed by part 
ID TPIDS . If zero, no force is computed in this direction. 
TPIDT Translational motion in the local |u1D461-direction is governed by part 
ID TPIDT . If zero, no force is computed in this direction. 
RPIDR Rotational motion about the local |u1D4JF-axis is governed by part ID 
RPIDR .  If zero, no moment is computed about this axis. 
RPIDS Rotational motion about the local |u1D46≠-axis is governed by part ID 
RPIDS .  If zero, no moment is computed about this axis. *
