2-416 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
KCON Stiﬀness coeﬃcient for contact interface stiﬀness.  If undeﬁned the 
maximum slope in the stress as a function of strain  curve is used.  
When the maximum slope is taken for the contact, th e time step 
size for this material is reduced for stability.  I n some cases, ∆|u1D461
may be signiﬁcantly smaller, so deﬁning a reasonabl e stiﬀness is 
recommended.

Material Formulation: 
The compressive behavior is illustrated in Figure M57-1  where hysteresis upon 
unloading is shown.  This behavior under uniaxial l oading is assumed not to 
signiﬁcantly couple in the transverse directions.  In tension the material behaves in a 
linear fashion until tearing occurs.  Although our implementation may be somewhat 
unusual, it was motivated by Storakers [1986]. 
 
The model uses tabulated input data for the loading  curve where the nominal stresses 
are deﬁned as a function of the elongations, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst, which are deﬁned in terms of the 
principal stretches, |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst, as: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst− 1 
The negative of the principal elongations (negative  of principal engineering strains) are 
stored in an arbitrary order as extra history varia bles 16, 17, and 18 if ED = 0 and as 
extra history variables 28, 29, and 30 if ED > 0.   (See NEIPH in *DATABASE_EXTENT_-
BINARY for output of extra history variables.) The stretch ratios are found by solving Typical unloading
curves determined by
the hysteretic unloading
factor. With the shape
factor equal to unity.

curvesTypical unloading for
a large shape factor, e.g. 
5.0-8.0, and a small 
hystereticfactor, e.g., 0.010.

2-418 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D45:.st+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JFCst  . 
Since we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, t he relaxation function is 
represented by one term from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst 
given by, 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D438/u1D451.st|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|oneCsts|u1D461Cst . 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a damper and 
spring in series.  We characterize this in the inpu t by a Young's modulus, |u1D438/u1D451.st, 
and decay constant, |u1D6FD|oneCst.  The formulation is performed in the local system of 
principal stretches where only the principal values  of stress are computed and 
triaxial coupling is avoided.  Consequently, the on e-dimensional nature of this 
foam material is unaﬀected by this addition of rate  eﬀects.  The addition of rate 
eﬀects necessitates twelve additional history varia bles per integration point.  
The cost and memory overhead of this model comes pr imarily from the need 
to “remember” the local system of principal stretch es. 
6.  Time Step Size.  The time step size is based on the current density and the 
maximum of the instantaneous loading slope, |u1D438, and KCON.  If KCON is un- 
deﬁned, the maximum slope in the loading curve is u sed instead. *. .

strain for the undamaged material (see Remark 2 ):

as a function of strain for the undamaged material.

stress as a function of strain for the undamaged ma terial

LCID2 Load curve or table ID.  The load curve ID (s ee *DEFINE_-
CURVE) deﬁnes the nominal stress as a function of strain for the 
damaged material.  The table ID (see *DEFINE_TA BLE) deﬁnes 
the nominal stress as a function of strain for the damaged 
material as a function of strain rate.  See Remark 2 . 
HU Hysteretic unloading factor between 0.0 and 1.0 (default = 1.0, 
that is, no energy dissipation); see Figure M179-1  and Remarks 1
and 2. 
BETA Decay constant to model creep in unloading, |u1D6FD 
DAMP Viscous coeﬃcient (.05 < recommended value < .50) to model 
damping eﬀects. 
LT.0.0: |DAMP | is the load curve ID that deﬁnes the damping *. .  
The uniaxial response is shown in Figure M179-1  with a large shape factor and 
small hysteretic factor.  If the shape factor is no t used, the unloading will occur 
on the loading curve for the second and subsequent cycles. 
2.  Damage and Hysteresis.   The damage is deﬁned as the ratio of the current 
volume strain to the maximum volume strain, and it is used to interpolate be- 
tween the responses deﬁned by LCID1 and LCID2.  
HU deﬁnes a hysteretic scale factor that is applied  to the stress interpolated 
from LCID1 and LCID2,  
|u1D7≠∆ = |<racketleftCvJHU + (1 −HU ) × min |parenleftCvJ1,|u1D4J2|iCst|nCst|tCst 
|u1D4J2|iCst|nCst|tCst |mCst|aCst|xCst |parenriµhtCvJ|u1D46≠Cst
|<racketriµhtCvJ|u1D7≠∆(LCID1,LCID2) 
where |u1D4J2int  is the internal energy and |u1D446 is the shape factor.  Setting HU to 1 re- 
sults in a scale factor of 1. Setting HU close to z ero scales the stress by the ratio 
of the internal energy to the maximum internal ener gy raised to the power S, 
resulting in the stress being reduced when the stra in is low. *
