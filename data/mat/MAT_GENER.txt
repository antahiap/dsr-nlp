 where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst(|u1D461Cst−/u1D̅0F.st) is the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent stres s measures.  This stress is 
added to the stress tensor determined from the stra in energy functional. 
 
If we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, the relaxation function is represented by 
18 terms from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
We characterize this in the input by shear moduli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and decay constants, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.  An 
arbitrary number of terms, up to 18, may be used wh en applying the viscoelastic model. 
 
For volumetric relaxation, the relaxation function is also represented by the Prony series 
in terms of bulk moduli: 
/u1D458(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43∆|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J8Csts/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
The Arrhenius and Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) shift  functions account for the eﬀects 
of the temperature on the stress relaxation.  A sca led time, |u1D461|minuteCst, 
|u1D461′=/integral.v:Φ(|u1D447)|u1D4J1|u1D461 |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst 
is used in the relaxation function instead of the p hysical time.  The Arrhenius shift 
function is 
Φ(|u1D447) = exp |<racketleftCvJ−|u1D434 |parenleftCvJ1
|u1D447−1
|u1D447REF |parenriµhtCvJ|<racketriµhtCvJ 
and the Williams-Landel-Ferry shift function is 
Φ(|u1D447) = exp |parenleftCvJ−|u1D434|u1D447 − |u1D447REF 
|u1D43J + |u1D447 − |u1D447REF |parenriµhtCvJ 
If all three values (TREF, A, and B) are nonzero, t he WLF function is used; the 
Arrhenius function is used if B is zero; and no sca ling is applied if all three values are 
zero. 
 
The moisture model allows the scaling of the materi al properties as a function of the 
moisture content of the material.  The shear and bu lk moduli are scaled by  |u1D6F+, the decay 
constants are scaled by |u1D6FD, and a moisture strain, |u1D6F∆(|u1D44≠)[|u1D44≠ − |u1D44≠/u1D442.st] is introduced 
analogous to the thermal strain. *. AL_JOINT_DISCRETE_BEAM  *. AL_JOINT_DISCRETE_BEAM

is not the case for IUNLD = 2.0.   For loading and unloading to 
follow the same path simply set LCIDTUR = LCIDTR.  For 
options IUNLD = 0.0 or 3.0 the unloading curve is not required.  
For IUNLD = 2.0, if LCID TUR is left blank or zero, the default is 
to use the same curve for unloading as for loading.

EQ.2.0: Loading follows loading curve; unloading follows 
unloading stiﬀness, K, to the unloading curve.  The  
loading and unloading curves may only intersect at the 
origin of the axes. 
EQ.3.0: Quadratic unloading fr om peak displacement value to 
a permanent oﬀset. 
OFFSET Oﬀset to determine permanent set upon unloading if the 
IUNLD = 3.0.  The permanent sets in compression and tension  are 
equal to the product of this oﬀset value and the ma ximum 
compressive and tensile displacements, respectively . 
DAMPF Damping factor for stability.  Values in the neighb orhood of unity 
are recommended.  This damping factor is properly s caled to 
eliminate time step size dependency.  Also, it is a ctive if and only 
if the local stiﬀness is deﬁned. 
LCIDT Load curve ID deﬁning translational force resultant  along the axis 
as a function of relative translational displacemen t.  If zero, no 
stiﬀness related forces are generated for this degr ee of freedom.  
The loading curves must be deﬁ ned from the most negative 
displacement to the most positive displacement.  Th e force does 
not need to increase monotonically for the loading curve.  The 
curves are extrapolated when the displacement range  falls 
outside the curve deﬁnition. 
LCIDTU Load curve ID deﬁning translational force resultant  along the axis 
as a function of relative translational displacemen t during 
unloading.  The force values deﬁned by this curve m ust increase 
monotonically from the most negative displacement t o the most 
positive displacement.  For IUNLD = 1.0, the slope of this curve 
must equal or exceed the loading curve for stabilit y reasons.  This 
is not the case for IUNLD = 2.0.  For loading and unloading to 
follow the same path simply set LCIDTU = LCIDT.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
FLCID Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_CURVE).   
TYPE.EQ.0: this curve deﬁnes force or moment as a function of 
deﬂection for nonlinear elastic behavior.   
TYPE.EQ.1: this curve deﬁnes the yield force as a function of 
plastic deﬂection.  If the abscissa of the ﬁrst poi nt 
of the curve is 0. the force magnitude i s identical in 
tension and compression, that is, only the sign 
changes.  If not, the yield stress in the compressi on 
is used when the spring force is negative.  The 
plastic displacement increases monotonically in 
this implementation.  The load curve is req uired 
input. 
HLCID Optional load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning force as a 
function of relative velocity.  If the origin of th e curve is at (0,0) , 
the force magnitude is identical for a given magnit ude of the 
relative velocity, meaning only the sign changes. 
C1 Damping coeﬃcient 
C2 Damping coeﬃcient 
DLE Factor to scale time units 
GLCID Optional load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning a scale 
factor as a function of deﬂection for load curve ID , HLCID.  If 
zero, a scale factor of unity is assumed. 
Remarks: 
1.  Elastic Behavior.   If TYPE = 0, elastic behavior is obtained.  In th is case, if the 
linear spring stiﬀness is used, the force, |u1D439, is given by: 
|u1D439 = K × ∆/u1D4:F+ D × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ  . 
But if the load curve ID is speciﬁed, the force is then given by: *. AL_SPRING_DISCRETE_BEAM  
 |u1D439|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D439 × |<racketleftCv61 + C1 × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ+ C2 × sgn|parenleftCv1∆/u1D4:Ḟ|parenriµhtCv1ln |parenleftCv6max /˙raceleft.v61. ,|dividesCv2∆/u1D4:Ḟ|dividesCv2

+ |u1D4J4(∆/u1D4:F)ℎ|parenleftCv1∆/u1D4:Ḟ|parenriµhtCv1  . 
Unless the origin of the curve starts at (0,0) , the negative part of the curve is 
used when the spring force is negative where the ne gative of the plastic dis- 
placement is used to interpolate, |u1D439|u1D466Cst.  The positive part of the curve is used 
whenever the force is positive.  
3.  Cross-Sectional Area.  The cross-sectional area is deﬁned on the section c ard 
for the discrete beam elements, See *SECTION_BEAM.  The square root of this 
area is used as the contact thickness oﬀset if thes e elements are included in the 
contact treatment.

This is Material Type 254. It is designed to model phase transformations in materials 
and the implied changes in the material properties.   It is applicable to hot stamping, 
heat treatment and welding processes for a wide ran ge of materials.  It accounts for up 
to 24 phases and provides a list of generic phase c hange mechanisms for each possible 
phase changes. The parameters for the phase transfo rmation laws are to be given in 
tabulated form. 
Given the current microstructure composition, the f ormulation implements a 
temperature and strain-rate dependent elastic-plast ic material with non-linear 
hardening behavior.  Above a certain temperature, t he model shows an ideal elastic-
plastic behavior with no evolution of plastic strai ns. 
The material has been implemented for solid and she ll elements and is suitable for 
explicit and implicit analysis.

 a)  Koistinen-Marburger (KM), law 1 .  
The KM formulation is tailored for non-diﬀusive tra nsformations.  In the 
most basic and commonly used version, the temperatu re dependent 
amount of the target phase is computed as 
|u1D46J|u1D44FCst= (|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst)|parenleftCv21.0 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FC.stKM (|u1D447Cststart −|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv2  .

This is a widely used model for diﬀusive phase tran sformation.  In litera-

thermal, incomplete transformation: 
|u1D46J|u1D44FCst= |u1D46Je q (|u1D447)(|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst)

⎠⎟⎞  . 
In the previous equation, exponent, |u1D4JB; equilibrium concentration, |u1D46Je q ; and 
relaxation time, /u1D̅0F, are functions of the temperature. 
In this material model, the diﬀerential form of the  JMAK equation is em-

As an optional parameter an accelerator |u1D6F+|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1 for the transformation can 
be deﬁned as function of equivalent plastic strain in PTTAB6.  If not de- 
ﬁned, a constant value of 1.0 is assumed. 
Like the Koistinen-Marburger case, a temperature de pendent equilibrium 
concentration, |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst, of the source phase can optionally be deﬁned.  If  de- *. ALIZED_PHASE_CHANGE  
 For |u1D46J|u1D44FCst< |u1D46J|u1D44FCsttre , t he transformation scheme comprises three steps.  Fi rst, a 
temperature dependent equilibrium fraction for the starting phase is cal- 
culated based on an incomplete KM equation: 
|u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst= (|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst− |u1D46Jinc )|parenleftCv21.0 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FC.stKM |parenleftCv1|u1D447CstKM /comm∙.sts/u1D460.sts−|u1D447Cst|parenriµhtCv1|parenriµhtCv2  . 
The KM-parameter |u1D6F+KM  and the start temperature |u1D447KM /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D46≠Cst must be given in 
PTX1 and PTX2, respectively.  The incompleteness pa rameter |u1D46Jinc  is a 
function of temperature deﬁned in PTTAB4. 
Second, if the current fraction of the starting pha se |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst exceeds the calculat- 
ed equilibrium concentration |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst,  a diﬀusional process follows.  It is de- 
scribed by a JMAK approach.  Its incremental form f or an isothermal 
process is given by 
|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst= |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst+ |parenleftCv2|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst− |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst|parenriµhtCv2|u1D4J2−|parenleftCv4|u1D461Cst
/u1D̅0F.st(|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv4/u1D45B.sts(/u1D44̅.sts)
. 
Naturally, a diﬀerential form of this equation is u sed in the model in order 
to be applicable to non-isothermal situations.  The  ﬁnal calculated change 
∆|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst in identiﬁed with the formation of a recovery phas e |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst= −∆|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst.  The 
parameters for the JMAK equation are given in PTTAB 1 ( |u1D4JB) and PTTAB2 
(/u1D̅0F). 
Third, some of the recovery phase is partially tran sformed into the target 
phase: 
∆|u1D46J|u1D44FCst= |u1D6F∆(|u1D447)|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst  . 
The quotient |u1D6F∆(|u1D447)  can be deﬁned in PTTAB5. 
f)  Phase recovery II, law 6.  
This is the second part of the recovery and can onl y be deﬁned if the pre- 
vious transformation law (law 5) has also been deﬁn ed with the same 
starting phase.  This second step aims to transform  the remaining fraction 
of the virtual, recovery phase |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst into the physical phases deﬁned in the 
material. 
In order to allow for the deﬁnition of more than tw o target phases for one 
recovery process, an optional parameter |u1D7≠2(|u1D447)  can be deﬁned as the only 
input of this transformation in PTTAB1.  It is used  to control the transfor- 
mation by  
∆|u1D46J|u1D44FCst= |u1D7≠2(|u1D447)|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst  . 
Note that |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst here refers to the complete fraction of the recove ry phase as 
calculated by the JMAK approach.  If the parameter is not deﬁned, then 
the remainder of the virtual phase fraction is comp letely transformed. *. ALIZED_PHASE_CHANGE  
 Furthermore, an incomplete transformation is possib le in case of relatively 
slow cooling rates.  For this purpose, you can deﬁn e two rate limits |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|oneCst 
and |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|twoCst in PTX2 and PTX3, respectively, and an incompleten ess parame- 
ter |u1D46Jinc (|u1D447) as a function of temperature in PTTAB2.  The corre sponding 
equation for the transformation then is given by: 
|u1D46J|u1D44FCst=/˙raceleft.v6(|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst)|parenleftCv21.0 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FC.stKM (|u1D447Cststart −|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv2 , for   |u1D447̇< |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|oneCst
(|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst− |u1D46Jinc)|parenleftCv21.0 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FC.stKM (|u1D447Cststart −|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv2 , for |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|oneCst<  |u1D447̇< |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|twoCst

b)  Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK). For TASTART = 2, the evolution

can be explicitly stated a

In the last equation, |u1D4JB(|u1D447)  denotes the exponent for the diﬀerential equa- 
tion, /u1D̅0F(|u1D447) the relaxation time and |u1D6F+|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st(|u1D447) denotes the limit value for the 
scale factor for inﬁnitely long processes.  All of those are functions of tem- 
perature and, thus, require the input of load curve  IDs in XAIPA1 ( |u1D4JB(|u1D447) ), 
XAIPA2 ( |u1D6F+e q (|u1D447)) and XAIPA3 ( /u1D̅0F(|u1D447)). 
In the material implementation a diﬀerential form o f the JMAK approach 
is invoked, which makes the formulation applicable to non-isothermal 
processes as well as independent of the start time of annealing. *. AL_VISCOELASTIC. -0.08-0.05-0.030.000.020.050.07

Here |u1D6F+(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) and |u1D6FD(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) are two new material properties that are functions  of the aging

Therefore, if one plots the stress as a function of  time on log-log scales, with the vertical 
axis being the stress and the horizontal axis being  the time, then the stress-relaxation 
curve for any aged time history can be obtained dir ectly from the stress-relaxation curve 
at |u1D461|u1D44∆Cst= 0 by imposing a vertical shift and a horizontal shif t on the stress-relaxation 
curves.  The vertical shift and the horizontal shif t are log |u1D6F+(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) and log |u1D6FD(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) respectively. *. AL_VIS-
