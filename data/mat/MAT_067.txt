4.  Failure.  Catastrophic failure based on force resultants occu rs if the following 
inequality is satisﬁed.

After failure the discrete element is deleted.  Lik ewise, catastrophic failure 
based on displacement resultants occurs if the foll owing inequality is satisﬁed:

− 1. ≥ 0  . 
After failure, the discrete element is deleted.  If  failure is included, either or 
both of the criteria may be used.
