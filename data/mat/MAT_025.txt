LS-DYNA R13 2-251 (MAT) Remarks: 
The implementation of an extended two-invariant cap  model, suggested by Stojko 
[1990], is based on the formulations of Simo, et al .  [1988, 1990] and Sandler and Rubin 
[1979].  In this model, the two-invariant cap theor y is extended to include nonlinear 
kinematic hardening as suggested by Isenberg, Vaugh an, and Sandler [1978].  A brief 
discussion of the extended cap model and its parame ters is given below.  
 
The cap model is formulated in terms of the invaria nts of the stress tensor.  The square 
root of the second invariant of the deviatoric stre ss tensor, /radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st is found from the 
deviatoric stresses /u1D42C as 
/radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st≡/radical.v51
2|u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
and is the objective scalar measure of the distorti onal or shearing stress.  The ﬁrst 
invariant of the stress, /u1D4:D|oneCst, is the trace of the stress tensor. 
 
The cap model consists of three surfaces in /radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st−/u1D4:D|oneCst space, as shown in Figure M25-1   
First, there is a failure envelope surface, denoted  |u1D4J3|oneCst in the ﬁgure.  The functional form of 
|u1D4J3|oneCst is 
|u1D4J3|oneCst=/radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st− min[|u1D439|u1D4J2Cst(/u1D4:D|oneCst), |u1D447mises ], 
where |u1D439|u1D4J2Cst is given by

where |u1D7≠6|u1D4J8Cst is the plastic consistency parameter for surface /u1D458.  If |u1D4J3|u1D4J8Cst< 0 then, |u1D7≠6̇|u1D4J8Cst= 0 and the 
response is elastic.  If |u1D4J3|u1D4J8Cst> 0 then surface /u1D458 is active and |u1D7≠6̇|u1D4J8Cst is found from the 
requirement that |u1D4J3̇|u1D4J8Cst= 0. 
 
Associated plastic ﬂow is assumed, so using Koiter’ s ﬂow rule, the plastic strain rate is 
given as the sum of contribution from all of the ac tive surfaces,

One of the major advantages of the cap model over o ther classical pressure-dependent 
plasticity models is the ability to control the amo unt of dilatancy produced under shear 
loading.  Dilatancy is produced under shear loading  as a result of the yield surface 
having a positive slope in /radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st−/u1D4:D space, so the assumption of plastic ﬂow in the 
direction normal to the yield surface produces a pl astic strain rate vector that has a 
component in the volumetric (hydrostatic) direction  (see Figure M25-1 ).  In models such 
as the Drucker-Prager and Mohr-Coulomb, this dilata ncy continues as long as shear 
loads are applied, and in many cases produces far m ore dilatancy than is experimental- 
ly observed in material tests.  In the cap model, w hen the failure surface is active, 
dilatancy is produced just as with the Drucker-Prag er and Mohr-Coulumb models.  
However, the hardening law permits the cap surface to contract until the cap intersects 
the failure envelope at the stress point, and the c ap remains at that point.  The local 
normal to the yield surface is now vertical, and th erefore the normality rule assures that 
no further plastic volumetric strain (dilatancy) is  created.  Adjustment of the parameters 
that control the rate of cap contractions permits e xperimentally observed amounts of 
dilatancy to be incorporated into the cap model, th us producing a constitutive law 
which better represents the physics to be modeled. 
 
Another advantage of the cap model over other model s such as the Drucker-Prager and 
Mohr-Coulomb is the ability to model plastic compac tion.  In these models all purely 
volumetric response is elastic.  In the cap model, volumetric response is elastic until the 
stress point hits the cap surface.  Therefore, plas tic volumetric strain (compaction) is 
generated at a rate controlled by the hardening law .  Thus, in addition to controlling the 
amount of dilatancy, the introduction of the cap su rface adds another experimentally 
observed response characteristic of geological mate rial into the model. 
 
The inclusion of kinematic hardening results in hys teretic energy dissipation under 
cyclic loading conditions.  Following the approach of Isenberg, et al.  [1978] a nonlinear 
kinematic hardening law is used for the failure env elope surface when nonzero values 
of /u1D450̅ and /u1D441 are speciﬁed.  In this case, the failure envelope surface is replaced by a family 
of yield surfaces bounded by an initial yield surfa ce and a limiting failure envelope *
