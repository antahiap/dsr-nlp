  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
EPFLG Function ﬂag: 
EQ.0.0:  Nonlinear elastic analysis 
EQ.1.0:  Multi-linear plastic analysis 
CTA, CTB, 
CTT Type of axial force-strain, moment-curvature, and t orque- twist 
rate curves (see Remarks): 
EQ.0.0:  Curve is symmetric. 
EQ.1.0:  Curve is asymmetric. 
N1 - N8 Axial forces at which moment- curvature curves are given.  The 
axial forces must be ordered monotonically increasi ng.  At least 
two axial forces must be deﬁned if the curves are s y mmetric.  At 
least three axial forces must be deﬁned if the curv es are 
asymmetric. 
LCMS1 - 
LCMS8 Load curve IDs for the moment-curvature curves abou t axis |u1D446
under corresponding axial forces. 
LCMT1 - 
LCMT8 Load curve IDs for the moment-curvature curves abou t axis |u1D447
under corresponding axial forces. 
LCT1 - LCT8 Load curve IDs for the torque- twist rate curves under 
corresponding axial forces. 
CFA, CFB, 
CFT For multi- linear plastic analysis only.  Ratio of axial, bend ing and 
torsional elastic rigidities to their initial value s, no less than 1.0 in 
value. 
HRULE Hardening rule, for multi-linear plastic anal ysis only. 
EQ.0.0: Isotropic hardening 
GT.0.0.AND.LT.1.0: Mixed hardening 
EQ.1.0: Kinematic hardening 
REPS Rupture eﬀective plastic axial strain
