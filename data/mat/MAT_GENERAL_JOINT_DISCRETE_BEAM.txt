This is Material Type 97.  This model is used to de ﬁne a general joint constraining any 
combination of degrees of freedom between two nodes .  The nodes may belong to rigid 
or deformable bodies.  In most applications the end  nodes of the beam are coincident 
and the local coordinate system ( |u1D4JF, |u1D46≠, |u1D461 axes) is deﬁned by CID (see *SECTION_BEAM).

Remarks: 
1.  Inertia and Stability.   For explicit calculations, the additional stiﬀnes s due to 
this joint may require addition mass and inertia fo r stability.  Mass and rotary 
inertia for this beam element is based on the deﬁne d mass density, the volume, 
and the mass moment of inertia deﬁned in the *SECTI ON_BEAM input. 
2.  Penalty Stiffness.   The penalty stiﬀness applies to explicit calculat ions.  For 
implicit calculations, constraint equations are gen erated and imposed on the 
system equations; therefore, these constants, RPST and RPSR, are not used. *
