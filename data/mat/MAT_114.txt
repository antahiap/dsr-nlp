 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
E Young’s modulus 
PR Poisson’s ratio 
SIGY Yield stress 
ETAN Tangent modulus; ignored if LCSS > 0 is deﬁned . 
FAIL Failure ﬂag: 
LT.0.0: User deﬁned failure subroutine, matusr_24  in dyn21.F , 
is called to determine failure. 
EQ.0.0: Failure is not considered.  This option is recommen ded 
if failure is not of interest since many calculatio ns will 
be saved. 
GT.0.0: Plastic strain to failure.  When the plastic strain  reaches 
this value, the element is deleted from the calcula tion. 
TDEL Minimum time step size for automatic element d eletion 
C Strain rate parameter, |u1D436; see Remarks below. 
P Strain rate parameter, |u1D4JD; see Remarks below. 
LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID.   
Load Curve ID.  The load curve deﬁnes eﬀective stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain.  If deﬁned, EP S1 - EP S8 and 
ES1 - ES8 are ignored.   *.   
 3.  If diﬀerent stress as a function of strain curves can be provided for various 
strain rates, the option using the reference to a t able (LCSS) can be used.  Then 
the table input in *DEFINE_TABLE must be used; see Figure M24-1 .*
