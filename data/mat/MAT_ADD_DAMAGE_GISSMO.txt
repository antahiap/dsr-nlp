2-62 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
damage, just with the given reference element size.  
LT.0: The reference element size is |REFS Z |. In addition to the 
reference size related damage values, a correspondi ng 
plastic strain is computed and written to history v ariable 
ND + 17. See remarks for details.   
NUMFIP Number or percentage of failed integration points prior to 
element deletion (default value is 1).  When the ma terial is a 
composite with diﬀerent through-the- thickness material types 
deﬁned using *PART_COMPOS ITE, then values other than 1 will 
not work correctly; use *DEFINE_ELEMENT_EROSION ins tead. 
GT.0.0: Number of integration points which must fail before  
element is deleted.  
LT.0.0: Applies only to shells. |N U MFIP|  is the percentage of 
layers which must fail before an element is deleted .  
For shell formulations with 4 integration points p er 
layer, the layer is considered failed if any of the  inte- 
gration points in the layer fails. 
LCSDG Failure strain curve/table or function: 
GT.0.0: Load curve ID or table ID. As a load curve, it deﬁn es 
equivalent plastic strain to failure as a function of triax- 
iality.  As a table, it deﬁnes for each Lode parame ter 
value (between - 1 and 1) a load curve ID giving the 
equivalent plastic strain to failure as a function of triax- 
iality for that Lode parameter value.  With HISVN ≠  0, 
a 3D table can be used, where failure strain is a f unc- 
tion of the history variable (TABLE_3D), Lode param e- 
ter (TA BLE), and triaxiality (CURVE).  With 
HISVN = 0, a 3D table i ntroduces thermal eﬀects, that 
is, failure strain is a function of temperature (TA BLE_-
3D), Lode parameter (TA BLE), and triaxiality 
(CURVE).  
LT.0.0: |LCSDG|  is the ID of a function (*DEFINE_FUNC TION) 
with the arguments triaxiality and Lode parameter: 
|u1D4J3(|u1D7≠2,/u1D4:F). 
ECRIT Critical plastic strain (material instability ); see below. 
LT.0.0: |ECRIT|  is either a load curve ID deﬁning critical 
equivalent plastic strain versus triaxiality or a t able ID 
deﬁning critical equivalent plastic strain as a fun ction *.   
2-64 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
function of strain rate (TABLE) and triaxility (CUR VE). 
GT.0: Scale ECRIT. 
LT.0: Do not scale ECRIT. 
SHRF Reduction factor for regularization for shear stres s states.  This 
parameter can be deﬁned between - 1.0 and +1.0. See remarks 
below. 
BIAXF Reduction factor for regularization for biaxial str ess states.  This 
parameter can be deﬁned between -1.0 and +1.0 . See remarks 
below. 
LCDLIM Load curve ID deﬁning damage limit values as a func tion of 
triaxiality.  Damage can be restricted to values le ss than 1.0 to 
prevent further stress reduction and failure for ce rtain 
triaxialities. 
MIDFAIL Mid-plane failure op tion for shell elements.  If active, then critical 
strain is only checked at the mid- plane integration point (IP), 
meaning an odd number for NIP should be used.  The other 
integration points compute their damage, but no cou pling to the 
stresses is done ﬁrst.  As soon as the mid- plane IP reaches 
ECRIT/DCRIT, then all the other IPs are also checke d.  
EQ.0.0: Inactive. 
EQ.1.0: Active.  Those of the non-mid- plane IPs that are 
already above their critical value immediately star t to 
reduce the stresses.  Those still below the critica l value 
still do not couple, only if they reach their crite rion.  
EQ.2.0: Active.  All of the non-mid- plane IPs immediately start 
to reduce the stresses.  NUMFIP is active. 
EQ.3.0: Active.  Same as 2 but when D = 1 is reached in the 
middle integration point, the element is eroded ins tan- 
taneously.  NUMFIP is disregarded.  
EQ.4.0: Active.  Damage and fai lure are applied only to the 
midpoint.  When D = 1 at the midpoint, the element is 
eroded.  NUM FIP is disregarded.  Integration points 
away from the midplane see no stress reduction and no 
failure. 
HISVN History variable used to evaluate the 3D tabl e LCS DG (and 
optionally 3D table ECRIT < 0): *.   
2-66 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 The model is based on an incremental formulation of  damage accumulation: 
∆|u1D437 =DMGEXP×|u1D437|parenleftCv4|oneCst−|oneCst
DMGEXP |parenriµhtCv4
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst 
where, 
|u1D437 Damage value  (0 ≤ |u1D437 ≤ 1).  For numerical reasons, |u1D437 is initialized to a 
value of 10 -20  for all damage types in the ﬁrst time step. 
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st Equivalent plastic strain to failure, determined f rom LCSDG as a function 
of the current triaxiality value |u1D7≠2 (and Lode parameter /u1D4:F as an option). 
A typical failure curve LCSDG for metal sheet, mode lled with shell ele- 
ments is shown in Figure 2-3 . Triaxiality should be monotonically increas- 
ing in this curve.  A reasonable range for triaxial ity is -2/3 to 2/3 if shell 
elements are used (plane stress). 
For 3-dimensional stress states (solid elements), t he possible range of tri- 
axiality goes from −∞ to +∞, but to get a good resolution in the internal 
load curve discretization (depending on parameter L CINT of *CON-
TROL_SOLUTION) you should deﬁne lower limits, such as -1 to 1 if 
LCINT = 100 (default). 
 ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst Equivalent plastic strain increment 
 
For constant values of failure strain, this damage rate can be integrated to get a relation 
of damage and actual equivalent plastic strain: 
|u1D437 = |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst

2-68 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 using the following relation, which is similar to t he accumulation of damage |u1D437 
except for the instability curve is used as an inpu t: 
∆|u1D439 =DMGEXP

DMGEXP |parenriµhtCv4∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst 
with, 
 |u1D439 Instability measure ( 0 ≤ |u1D439 ≤ 1 ).  
 |u1D7≠≠p,loc  Equivalent plastic strain to instability, determin ed from ECRIT 
 ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst Equivalent plastic strain increment 
As soon as the instability measure |u1D439 reaches unity, the current value of damage 
|u1D437 in the respective element is stored.  Damage will from this point on be cou- 
pled to the ﬂow stress using the relation described  above. 
3.  If no input for ECRIT is made, parameter DCRIT wil l be considered.  Coupling 
of damage to the stress tensor starts if this value  (damage threshold) is exceeded 
(0 ≤ DCRIT ≤ 1).  Coupling of damage to stress is d one using the relation de- 
scribed above. 
This input allows for the use of extreme values als o – for example, DCRIT = 1.0 
would lead to no coupling at all, and element delet ion under full load (brittle 
fracture). 
 
The values of SHRF and BIAXF generally lie between 0.0 and 1.0 where 0.0 means full 
regularization and 1.0 means no regularization unde r shear (triaxiality = 0.0 for 
SHRF = 1.0) or biaxial tension (triaxiality = 2/3 f or BIAXF = 1.0).  Any other 
intermediate triaxiality follows a linear interpola tion between triaxiality 0.0 and 1/3 and 
also between triaxiality 1/3 and 2/3. Notice that a  full regularization is always 
undertaken for a one-dimensional tensile stress sta te (triaxiality = 1/3) according to the 
factors deﬁned under LCREGD. For the sake of genera lization, both SHRF and BIAXF 
can also assume negative values (e.g., SHRF = -1.0 and BIAXF = -1.0).  In this case, 
regularization is aﬀected not at triaxialities 0.0 and 2/3 but rather at the triaxialities 
where the failure curve (LCSDG) crosses the instabi lity curve (-ECRIT).  The use of a 
triaxiality-dependent regularization approach may b e necessary because simple 
regularization only depending on the element size c an be unrealistic for certain stress 
states. 
If the results of a ﬁrst simulation should be trans ferred to a second computation with 
potentially modiﬁed mesh size, such as mapping from  forming to crash, it might be 
necessary to alter damage values (and maybe plastic  strain) as well.  For that purpose, 
reference element size REFSZ can be deﬁned.  With R EFSZ  >  0, corresponding damage 
is computed in the same fashion as the actual damag e, just with the given reference 
element size instead, and written to history variab le ND + 9. An alternative approach is *.
