This is  Material Type 7 for discrete elements (*ELEMENT_DIS CRETE).  This material 
provides a three Parameter Maxwell Viscoelastic tra nslational or rotational spring.  
Optionally, a cutoﬀ time with a remaining constant force/moment can be deﬁned.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label n ot exceeding 8 
characters must be speciﬁed. 
K0 |u1D43∆|zeroCst, short time stiﬀness 
KI |u1D43∆∞, long time stiﬀness 
BETA Decay parameter, |u1D6FD 
TC Cut oﬀ time.  After this time, a constant force/mom ent is 
transmitted. 
FC Force/moment after cutoﬀ time 
COPT Time implementation option: 
EQ.0.0: incremental time change 
NE.0.0: continuous time change 
Remarks: 
1.  Stiffness.   The time varying stiﬀness, |u1D43∆(|u1D461) , may be described in terms of the 
input parameters as 
|u1D43∆(|u1D447) = |u1D43∆∞+ (|u1D43∆|zeroCst− |u1D43∆∞) exp|parenleftCv1−|u1D6FDt|parenriµhtCv1  . 
This equation was implemented by Schwer [1991] as e ither a continuous func- 
tion of time or incrementally following the approac h of Herrmann and Peter- *.   
 son [1968].  The continuous function of time implem entation has the disad- 
vantage of the energy absorber’s resistance decayin g with increasing time even 
without deformation.  The advantage of the incremen tal implementation is that 
an energy absorber must undergo some deformation be fore its resistance de- 
cays, meaning there is no decay until impact, even in delayed impacts.  The 
disadvantage of the incremental implementation is t hat very rapid decreases in 
resistance cannot be easily matched. 
2.  Rotational Displacement.   Rotational displacement is measured in radians. *
