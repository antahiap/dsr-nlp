calculated from the distance between the initial po sitions of the element’s corner nodes

While the total energy under the traction-separatio n law is given by |u1D43A/u1D4:6.st, one further 
parameter is needed to describe the exact shape of the tri-linear material model.  If the 
area (energy) under the constant stress (plateau) r egion is denoted |u1D43A|u1D443Cst (see Fig- 
ure M240-1 ), a parameter |u1D4J3/u1D4:A.st deﬁnes the shape of the traction-separation law,

0, T0, S0, FG1, and FG2 (as well as GMOD3, G3C_0, R 0, and FG3 if combined with 
3MODES) should refer to *DEFINE_FUNCTION IDs.  The arguments of those functions 
include several properties of both connection partn ers if corresponding solid elements 
are in a tied contact with shell elements. 
These functions depend on: 
(t1, t2) = thic k nesses of b oth b ond partners 
|parenleftCv1sy1, sy2|parenriµhtCv1 = initial yield stresses at plastic strain  of 0.002 
(sm1, sm2) = maximum engineering yield stresses (nec k ing points) 
r = strain rate 
a = element area 
For T0 = -100 such a function could look like:

 func(t1,t2,sy1,sy2,sm1,sm2,r,a)=0.5*(sy1+sy2 ) 
Since material parameters must be identiﬁed from bo th bond partners during
