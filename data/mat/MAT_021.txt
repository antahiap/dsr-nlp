element normal. 
EQ.4.0: locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector, /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D4JD, which deﬁne the centerline axis.  
This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: the absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VEC TOR).  Available in R3 version of 971 
and later.

where |u1D447 is temperature.  After computing |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  we then obtain the Cauchy stress:

|u1D7≠+|zeroCst∂|u1D46J|u1D4J6Cst

∂/u1D44B|u1D4J9Cst|u1D446|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst  
This model will predict realistic behavior for ﬁnit e displacement and rotations as long 
as the strains are small. 
 
In the implementation for shell elements, the stres ses are integrated in time and are 
updated in the corotational coordinate system.  In this procedure the local material axes 
are assumed to remain orthogonal in the deformed co nﬁguration.  This assumption is 
valid if the strains remain small. *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-229 (MAT) The current degree of cure as well as the chemical shrinkage in the diﬀerent directions 
is output in the history variables.  For solid elem ents it can be found at positions 30 to 
33 and for shell elements at positions 22 to 25. *
