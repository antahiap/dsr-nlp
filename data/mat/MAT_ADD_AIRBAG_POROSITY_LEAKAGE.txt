LS-DYNA R13 2-35 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
X2 X2 is one of the coeﬃcients of the porosity in the equation of 
Anagonye and Wang [1999].  (Deﬁned below in descrip tion for 
X0/X1) 
X3 X3 is one of the coeﬃcients of the porosity in the equation of 
Anagonye and Wang [1999].  (Deﬁned below in descrip ti on for

ELA Eﬀective leakage area for blocked fabric, ELA 
LT.0.0: |ELA|  is the load curve ID of the curve deﬁning ELA as 
a function of time.  The default value of zero assu mes 
that no leakage occurs.  A value of .10 would assum e 
that 10% of the blocked fabric is leaking gas. 
FVOPT Fabric venting option. 
EQ.1: Wang-Nefske fo rmulas for venting through an oriﬁce are 
used.  Blockage is not considered. 
EQ.2: Wang- Nefske formulas for venting through an oriﬁce are 
used.  Blockage of venting area due to contact is c onsid- 
ered. 
EQ.3: Leakage formulas of Graefe, Krummheuer, and Sieja k 
[1990] are used.  Blockage is not considered. 
EQ.4: Leakage formulas of Graefe, Krummheuer, and Siejak 
[1990] are used.  Blockage of venting area due to c ontact 
is considered. 
EQ.5: Leakage formulas based on ﬂow through a porous medi a 
are used.  Blockage is not considered. 
EQ.6: Leakage formulas based on ﬂow through a porous medi a 
are used.  Blockage of venting area due to contact is con- 
sidered. 
EQ.7: Leakage is based on gas volume outﬂow as a function  of 
pressure load curve [Lian, 2000].  Blockage is not consid- 
ered.  Absolute pressure is used in the porous-velo city-
versus-pressure load curve, given as FAC. 
EQ.8: Leakage is based on gas volume outﬂow as a function  of 
pressure load curve [Lian 2000].  Blockage of venti ng or 
porous area due to contact is considered.  Absolute  pres- 
sure is used in the porous-velocity-versus- pressure load 
curve, given as FAC. *MAT  *.   *MAT
