  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
GBC |u1D43A|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst , shear modulus 
GCA |u1D43A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst , shear modulus 
KF Bulk modulus of failed material 
AOPT Material axes option (see MAT _{ OPTION }TROPIC_ELASTIC for 
a more complete description) (SPH particles only su pport 
AOPT = 2.0): 
EQ.0.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes 1, 2, and 4, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_NODES.  For shells only, the axes are then ro-
tated about the shell element normal by an angle BE -
TA. 
EQ.1.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined by a 
point in space and the global location of the eleme nt 
center; this is the |u1D44∆-direction.  This option is for solid 
elements only. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector /u1D42F with the 
element normal 
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D4JD, which deﬁne the centerline ax- 
is.  This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system ID 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VEC TOR).  Available in R3 version of 971 
and later. *. _ OPTION _MODEL
