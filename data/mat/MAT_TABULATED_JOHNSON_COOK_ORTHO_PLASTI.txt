This is Material Type 264. This is an orthotropic e lastic plastic material law with J3 
dependent yield surface.  This material considers t ensile/compressive asymmetry in the 
material response, which is important for HCP metal s like titanium.  This model is 
available for solid elements.

a function of plastic strain for that rate in the 4 5 degree direction. 
LCS45T Table ID deﬁning for each temperature value a load curve ID 
giving the (quasi- static) shear yield stress versus strain for that 
temperature.  The load cur ves deﬁne shear yield stress as a 
function of plastic strain or eﬀective plastic stra in (see IFLAG) in 
the 45 degree direction.

Remarks: 
If IFLAG = 0 the compressive and shear curves are d eﬁned as follows: 
σcomp |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/co⋯⋯a.st comp , |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst/co⋯⋯a.st comp |parenriµhtCv2,     |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/co⋯⋯a.stcomp = |u1D7≠≠comp −|u1D7≠∆comp

|u1D71J|u1D461  
where comp is one of the tension (0°,45°,90°), compression (0° ,45°,90°), tension and 
compression thickness or shear components. 
 
If IFLAG = 1, the compressive and shear curves are deﬁned as follows:
