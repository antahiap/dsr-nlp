LCD Optional load curve ID deﬁning damping ratio of hys teresis at 
diﬀerent strain amplitudes (overrides Masing rules for 
unload/reload).  The |u1D46J-axis is shear strain; the |u1D466-axis is the 
damping ratio (such as 0.05 for 5% damping).  The s trains ( |u1D46J-axis 
values) of curve LCD must be identical to those of curve LCID. 
LCSR Load curve ID deﬁning plastic strain rate scaling e ﬀect on yield 
stress.  See *DEFINE_CURVE.  The |u1D46J-axis is plastic strain rate; the 
|u1D466-axis is the yield enhancement factor. 
PINIT Flag for pressure sensitivity.  Positive values app ly to both B 
(elastic stiﬀness scaling) and the A0, A1, A2 equat ions (strength 
scaling).  Negative v alues apply only to B, while the A0, A1, A2 
equations use the current pressure like PINIT = 0. 
|PINT|.EQ.0: Use current pressure (will vary during the 
analysis). 
|PINT|.EQ.1: Use pressure from initial stress state. 
|PINT|.EQ.2: Use initial “plane stress” pressure (|u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst+ |u1D7≠∆ℎ)/2. 
|PINT|.EQ.3: User (compressive) initial vertical stress.

The constants |u1D44∆|zeroCst, |u1D44∆|oneCst, and |u1D44∆|twoCst govern the pressure sensitivity of the yield stres s.  Only the 
ratios between these values are important - the abs olute stress values are taken from the 
stress-strain curve.  The shear stress-strain curve  (with points (/u1D̅0F|oneCst, |u1D6F∆|oneCst), 
(/u1D̅0F|twoCst, |u1D6F∆|twoCst),…,  (/u1D̅0F|u1D441Cst, |u1D6F∆|u1D441Cst)) is converted into a series of /u1D441 elastic perfectly plastic curves such 
that ∑|parenleftCv2/u1D̅0F|u1D4J6,(|u1D6F∆)|parenriµhtCv2=/u1D̅0F(|u1D6F∆), as shown in Figure M79-1 .  
 
 
 
Each elastic perfectly plastic curve represents one  “layer” in the material model.  
Deviatoric stresses are stored and calculated separ ately for each layer.  The total 
deviatoric stress is the sum of the deviatoric stre sses in each layer.  By this method, 
hysteretic (energy-absorbing) stress-strain curves are generated in response to any 
strain cycle of amplitude greater than the lowest y ield strain of any layer.  The example 
below ( Figure M79-2 ) shows response to small and large strain cycles s uperposed on 
the input curve (thick line labeled backbone curve) . 
Deﬁnition of shear strain and shear stress: 
Diﬀerent deﬁnitions of “shear strain” and “shear st ress” are possible when applied to 
three-dimensional stress states.  .   *.   
 Pressure sensitivity can make the solution sensitiv e to numerical noise.  In cases where 
the expected pressure changes are small compared to  the initial stress state, using 
pressure from the initial stress state instead of c urrent pressure as the basis for the 
pressure sensitivity (option PINIT) may be preferab le.  This causes the bulk modulus 
and shear stress-strain curve to be calculated once  for each element at the start of the 
analysis and to remain ﬁxed thereafter.  Positive s ettings of PINIT aﬀect both stiﬀness 
scaling (calculated using B) and strength scaling ( calculated using A0, A1 and A2).  If 
PINIT options 2 (“plane stress” pressure) or 3 (ver tical stress) are used, these quantities 
substitute for pressure |u1D4JD in the equations above.  Input values of |u1D4JDref  and |u1D4JD|zeroCst should then 
also be “plane stress” pressure or vertical stress,  respectively.  Negative settings of 
PINIT have these eﬀects only on stiﬀness scaling (B ), while the strength scaling is 
calculated from the current pressure as for PINIT =  0.   
 
If PINIT is used, B is allowed to be as high as 1.0  (stiﬀness proportional to initial 
pressure); otherwise, values of B higher than about  0.5 are not recommended. 
Dilatancy: 
Parameters DIL_A, DIL_B, DIL_C and DIL_D control th e compaction and dilatancy that 
occur in sandy soils as a result of shearing motion .  If this facility is used together with 
pore water pressure (see *CONTROL_PORE_FLUID), liqu efaction can be modeled.  
However, note that the compaction/dilatancy algorit hm used in this material model is 
very unsophisticated compared to recently published  research ﬁndings.
