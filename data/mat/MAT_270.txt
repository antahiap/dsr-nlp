14.  LCTRE (Transformation Induced Strains).   Transformation induced strains 
can be included with a load curve LCTRE as a functi on of temperature.  The 
load curve represents the diﬀerence between the har d phases and the austenite 
phase in the dilatometer curves.  Therefore, positi ve curve values result in a 
negative transformation strain for austenitization and a positive transfor- 
mation strain for the phase transformation from aus tenite to one of the hard 
phases.

that are involved in the plastic equations.  To thi s end, the eﬀective yield stress 
is given as 
|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st= |u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st(|u1D447) + |u1D6FD /u1D4:B (|u1D447)|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst

where |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst is the rate of eﬀective plastic strain that follow s from consistency

3.  Annealing.   When the temperature reaches the start annealing temperature, 
the material starts assuming its virgin properties.   Beyond the start annealing 
temperature it behaves as an ideal elastic-plastic material but with no evolution 
of plastic strains.  The resetting of eﬀective plas tic properties in the annealing 
temperature interval is done by modifying the eﬀect ive plastic strain and back 
stress before the stress update as 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JBCstmax |<racketleftCv60, min |parenleftCv61,|u1D447 − |u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend

|u1D447|u1D44∆Cststart − |u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend |parenriµhtCv6|<racketriµhtCv6 
 
Depending on the choice for parameter ANOPT, anneal ing may also aﬀect the 
thermal expansion of the structure.  A cut-oﬀ tempe rature can be deﬁned for 
the evaluation of the thermal expansion.  Above thi s temperature limit, further 
expansion is suppressed.  The cut-oﬀ temperature do es not necessarily coin- 
cide with the annealing temperature. 
4.  Average temperature rate.   The optional Card 3 is used to set history variab le 
11, which is the average temperature rate by which the temperature has gone 
from T2PHASE to T1PHASE. To fringe this variable th e range should be set to 
positive values since it is during the simulation t emporarily used to store the 
time when the material has reached temperature T2PH ASE and is then stored *.
