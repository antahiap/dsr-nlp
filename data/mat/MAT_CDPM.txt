  
This is material type 273. CDPM is a damage plastic  concrete model based on work 
published in Grassl et al.  (2011, 2013) and Grassl  and Jirásek (2006).  This model is 
aimed to simulations where failure of concrete stru ctures subjected to dynamic loadings 
is sought.  It describes the characterization of th e failure process subjected to multi-axial 
and rate-dependent loading.  The model is based on eﬀective stress plasticity and with a 
damage model based on both plastic and elastic stra in measures.  This material model is 
available only for solids. 
 
There are a lot of parameters for the advanced user  but note that most of them have 
default values that are based on experimental tests .  They might not be useful for all 
types of concrete and all types of load paths but t hey are values that can be used as a 
good starting point.  If the default values are not  good enough the theory chapter at the 
end of the parameter description can be of use.
