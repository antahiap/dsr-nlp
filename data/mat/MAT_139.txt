 Remarks: 
1.  Load Curves.   This material model is available for the Belytsch ko resultant 
beam element only.  Plastic hinges form at the ends  of the beam when the mo- 
ment reaches the plastic moment.  The plastic momen t as a function of rotation 
relationship is speciﬁed by the user in the form of  a load curve and scale factor.  
The points of the load curve are (plastic rotation in radians, plastic moment).  
Both quantities should be positive for all points, with the ﬁrst point being (ze- 
ro, initial plastic moment).  Within this constrain t any form of characteristic 
may be used, including ﬂat or falling curves.  Diﬀe rent load curves and scale 
factors may be speciﬁed at each node and about each  of the local |u1D46≠ and |u1D461 axes. 
Axial collapse occurs when the compressive axial lo ad reaches the collapse 
load.  Collapse load as a function of collapse deﬂe ction is speciﬁed in the form 
of a load curve.  The points of the load curve are either 
|parenleftCv1true strain, collapse force|parenriµhtCv1  or |parenleftCv1change in length, collapse force|parenriµhtCv1 .  Both quanti- 
ties should be entered as positive for all points a nd will be interpreted as com- 
pressive.  The ﬁrst point should be |parenleftCv1zero, initial collapse load|parenriµhtCv1 . 
The collapse load may vary with end moment as well as with deﬂections.  In 
this case several load-deﬂection curves are deﬁned,  each corresponding to a 
diﬀerent end moment.  Each load curve should have t he same number of 
points and the same deﬂection values.  The end mome nt is deﬁned as the aver- 
age of the absolute moments at each end of the beam  and is always positive. 
2.  Damping.   Stiﬀness-proportional damping may be added using the damping 
factor |u1D7≠6.  This is deﬁned as follows: 
|u1D7≠6 =2 ×/u1D̅0∫
|u1D714 
where /u1D̅0∫ is the damping factor at the reference frequency |u1D714 (in radians per sec- 
ond).  For example, if 1% damping at 2Hz is require d 
|u1D7≠6 =2 × 0.01 
2/u1D̅0B× 2= 0.0015 92 
If damping is used, a small time step may be requir ed.  LS-DYNA does not 
check this so to avoid instability it may be necess ary to control the time step 
using a load curve.  As a guide, the time step requ ired for any given element is 
multiplied by 0.3/u1D4:F/u1D450|u1D7≠6 ⁄ when damping is present ( /u1D4:F = element length, /u1D450 = sound 
speed). 
3.  Moment Interaction.   Plastic hinges can form due to the combined actio n of 
moments about the three axes.  This facility is act ivated only when yield mo- 
ments are deﬁned in the material input.  A hinge fo rms when the following 
condition is ﬁrst satisﬁed. *.   
 On forming a hinge, upper limit moments are set.  T hese are given by  
|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstupper = max 
⎝⎜⎛|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst,|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstyield 
2⎠⎟⎞ 
with similar conditions holding for |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D462Csts|u1D4JDCsts|u1D4JDCsts|u1D4J2Csts /u1D45F.stsand |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst|u1D462Csts|u1D4JDCsts|u1D4JDCsts|u1D4J2Csts /u1D45F.sts.  Thereafter the plastic 
moments will be given by 
|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JDCst= min(|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstupper , |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstcur v e )  , 
where |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JDCsts is the current plastic moment and |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstcur v e  is the moment from the 
load curve at the current rotation scaled by the sc ale factor.  |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D4JDCstand |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst|u1D4JDCst satisfy 
similar conditions.  |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D4JDCstand |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst|u1D4JDCst satisfy similar conditions. 
This provides an upper limit to the moment that can  be generated; it represents 
the softening eﬀect of local buckling at a hinge si te.  Thus, if a member is bent 
about the local |u1D46≠-axis, it will then be weaker in torsion and about its local |u1D461-axis.  
For moments-softening curves, the eﬀect is to trim oﬀ the initial peak (although 
if the curves subsequently harden, the ﬁnal hardeni ng will also be trimmed 
oﬀ). 
It is not possible to make the plastic moment vary with the current axial load, 
but it is possible to make hinge formation a functi on of axial load and subse- 
quent plastic moment a function of the moment at th e time the hinge formed.  
This is discussed in Remark 4 . 
4.  Independent Plastic Hinge Formation.   In addition to the moment interac- 
tion equation, Cards 7 through 18 allow plastic hin ges to form independently 
for the |u1D46≠-axis and |u1D461-axis at each end of the beam as well as for the to rsional axis.  
A plastic hinge is assumed to form if any component  of the current moment 
exceeds the yield moment as deﬁned by the yield mom ent as a function axial 
force curves input on cards 7 and 8.  If any of the  5 curves is omitted, a hinge 
will not form for that component.  The curves can b e deﬁned for both compres- 
sive and tensile axial forces.  If the axial force falls outside the range of the 
curve, the ﬁrst or last point in the curve will be used.  A hinge forming for one 
component of moment does not aﬀect the other compon ents. 
Upon forming a hinge, the magnitude of that compone nt of moment will not 
be permitted to exceed the current plastic moment.  The current plastic mo- 
ment is obtained by interpolating between the plast ic moment as a function of 
plastic rotation curves input on cards 10, 12, 14, 16, or 18.  Curves may be input 
for up to 8 hinge moments, where the hinge moment i s deﬁned as the yield 
moment at the time that the hinge formed.  Curves m ust be input in order of 
increasing hinge moment and each curve should have the same plastic rotation 
values.  The ﬁrst or last curve will be used if the  hinge moment falls outside the 
range of the curves.  If no curves are deﬁned, the plastic moment is obtained *
