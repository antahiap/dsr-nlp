This is  Material Type 34.  This material is especially deve loped for airbag materials.  
The fabric model is a variation on the layered orth otropic composite model of material 
22 and is valid for 3 and 4 node membrane elements only. 
 
In addition to being a constitutive model, this mod el also invokes a special membrane 
element formulation which is more suited to the def ormation experienced by fabrics 
under large deformation.  For thin fabrics, bucklin g can result in an inability to support 
compressive stresses; thus a ﬂag is included for th is option.  A linearly elastic liner is 
also included which can be used to reduce the tende ncy for these elements to be 
crushed when the no-compression option is invoked.  In LS-DYNA versions after 931 
the isotropic elastic option is available.

Remarks: 
1.  The Compressive Stress Elimination Option for Airba g Wrinkling.   Setting 
CSE = 1 switches oﬀ compressive stress in the fabri c, thereby eliminating wrin- 
kles.  Without this “no compression” option, the ge ometry of the bag’s wrin- 
kles controls the amount of mesh reﬁnement.  In eli minating the wrinkles, this 
feature reduces the number of elements needed to at tain an accurate solution. *.

FINE_CURVE. 
Additionally, for formulations 14, -14, and 24, the  uniaxial loading curves LCA 
and LCB may be deﬁned for negative values of strain  and stress, that is, a 
straightforward extension of the curves into the co mpressive region.  This is 
available for modeling the compressive stresses res ulting from tight folding of 
airbags. 
The |u1D44∆-axis and |u1D44F-axis stress follow the curves for the entire deﬁne d strain re- 
gion and if compressive behavior is desired the use r should preferably make 
sure the curve covers all strains of interest.  For  strains below the ﬁrst point on 
the curve, the curve is extrapolated using the stiﬀ ness from the constant values, 
EA  or  EB.  
Shear stress/strain behavior is assumed symmetric a nd curves should be de- 
ﬁned for positive strain only.  However, formulatio ns 14, -14, and 24 allow the 
extending of the curves in the negative strain regi on to model asymmetric be- 
havior.  The asymmetric option cannot be used with a shear stress unload 
curve.  If a load curve is omitted, the stress is c alculated from the appropriate 
constant modulus, EA,  EB,  or  GAB. 
7.  Yield Behavior.   When formulations 4, 14, -14, and 24 (see FORM) a re used 
with loading and unloading curves the initial yield  strain is set equal to the 
strain of the ﬁrst point in the load curve having a  stress greater than zero.  
When the current strain exceeds the yield strain, t he stress follows the load 
curve and the yield strain is updated to the curren t strain.  When unloading 
occurs, the unload/reload curve is shifted along th e |u1D46J-axis until it intersects the 
load curve at the current yield strain and then the  stress is calculated from the 
shifted curve.  When using unloading curves, compre ssive stress elimination 
should be active to prevent the ﬁbers from developi ng compressive stress dur- 
ing unloading when the strain remains tensile.  To use this option, the unload 
curve should have a nonnegative second derivate so that the curve will shift right as the 
yield stress increases.  In fact, if a shift to the  left would be needed, the unload curves is 
not used and unloading will follow the load curve i nstead. 
If LCUA, LCUB, or LCUAB are input with negative cur ve ID values, then un- 
loading is handled diﬀerently.  Instead of shifting  the unload curve along the 
|u1D46J-axis, the curve is stretched in both the |u1D46J-direction and |u1D466-direction such that 
the ﬁrst point remains anchored at (0,0)  and the initial intersection point of the 
curves is moved to the current yield point.  This o ption guarantees the stress 
remains tensile while the strain is tensile, so com pressive stress elimination is 
not necessary.  To use this option the unload curve should have an initial slope less 
steep than the load curve and should steepen such t hat it intersects the load curve at 
some positive strain value.  *.   
2-318 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 mented to reduce the stored initial strain values o ver time thereby restor- 
ing the total stain which drives the airbag towards  the correct volume. 
During each cycle, the stored initial strains are s caled by (1.0 − TSRFAC) .  A 
small value on the order of 0.0001 is typically suﬃ cient to restore the strains in 
a few milliseconds of simulation time.

The adjustment to restore initial strain is then, 
/u1D6C6ad justment =εinitial /product.v1[1 − TSFRAC]
|u1D4J6Cst. 
a)  Time Dependent TSRFAC.   When TSRFAC ˂ 0, |TSRFAC|  becomes the ID of 
a curve that deﬁnes TSRFAC as a function of time.  To delay the eﬀect of 
TSRFAC, the curve ordinate value should be initiall y zero and should 
ramp up to a small number to restore the strain at an appropriate time 
during the simulation.  The adjustment to restore i nitial strain is then, 
/u1D6C6ad justment (|u1D461|u1D4J6Cst) =εinitial /product.v1[1 − TSFRAC(|u1D461|u1D4J6Cst)]
|u1D4J6Cst. 
To prevent airbags from opening prematurely, it is recommended to use 
the load curve option of TSRFAC to delay the strain  restoration until the 
airbag is partially opened due to pressure loading.  
b)  Alternate Time Dependent TSRFAC.  For fabric formulations 2 and higher, a 
second curve option is invoked by setting TSRFAC ≥ 1 where TSRFAC is 
again the ID of a curve that deﬁnes TSRFAC as a fun ction of time.  Like 
the ﬁrst curve option, the stored initial strain va lues are scaled by 
(1.0 − TSRFAC) , but the modiﬁed initial strains are not saved, so  the eﬀect 
of TSRFAC does not accumulate.  In this case the ad justment to eliminate 
initial strain

Therefore, the curve should ramp up from zero to on e to fully restore the 
strain.  This option gives the user better control of the rate of restoring the 
strain as it is a function of time rather than solu tion time step. 
11.  Enhancements to the Material Formulations.   Material formulations (see 
FORM) 12, 13, and 14 are enhanced versions of formu lations 2, 3, and 4, respec- 
tively.  The most notable diﬀerence in their behavi or is apparent when a refer- 
ence geometry is used for the fabric.  As discussed  in Remark 10 , the strain is 
modiﬁed to prevent initial strains from prematurely  opening an airbag at the 
start of a calculation. 
Formulations 2, 3, and 4 subtract the initial tensi le strains, while the enhanced 
formulations subtract the total initial strains.  T herefore, the enhanced formula- *.

|u1D434|oneCst+ |u1D434|twoCst  . 
14.  Coating Feature for Additional Rotational Resistanc e.   It is possible to 
model coating of the fabric using a sheet of elasti c-ideal-plastic material where 
the Young’s modulus, yield stress and thickness is speciﬁed for the coat mate- 
rial.  This will add rotational resistance to the f abric for a more realistic behav- 
ior of coated fabrics.  To read these properties se t FORM = -14, which adds an 
extra card containing the three ﬁelds ECOAT, SCOAT and TCOAT, corre- 
sponding to the three coat material properties ment ioned above. 
The thickness, TCOAT, applies to both sides of the fabric.  The coat material for 
a certain fabric element deforms along with this an d all elements connected to 
this element, which is how the rotations are “captu red.”  Note that unless 
TCOAT is set to a negative value, the coating will add to the membrane stiﬀ- 
ness.  For negative values of TCOAT the thickness i s set to |TCOAT|  and the 
membrane contribution from the coating is suppresse d.  For this feature to 
work, the fabric parts must not include any T-inter sections, and all of the sur- 
face normal vectors of connected fabric elements mu st point in the same direc- 
tion.  This option increases the computational comp lexity of this material. 
15.  Poisson’s Ratios.  Fabric forms 12, 13, 14, -14, and 24 allow input of  both the 
minor Poisson’s ratio, /u1D̅08|u1D44FCst|u1D44∆Cst , and the major Poisson’s ratio, /u1D̅08|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst . This allows 
asymmetric Poisson’s behavior to be modelled.  If t he major Poisson’s ratio is 
left blank or input as zero, then it will be calcul ated using /u1D̅08|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst =/u1D̅08|u1D44FCst|u1D44∆Cst |u1D438Cst|u1D44∆Csts
|u1D438Cst|u1D44FCsts. 
16.  St.  Venant-Wantzel Leakage.  If a negative value for the fabric venting 
option FVOPT is used (only -1 and -2 are supported) , the mass ﬂux through a 
fabric membrane is calculated according St.Venant-W antzel by 
|u1D4JȦ= |u1D434|eCst /f.st/f.st/u1D6F∫/radical.v12|u1D4JD|u1D4J6Cst|u1D7≠+|u1D4J6Cst 
where |u1D4JD|u1D4J6Cst describes the internal pressure, |u1D7≠+|u1D4J6Cst is the density of the outlet gas, and 
the eﬄuence function /u1D̅1: depends on the character of the ﬂow, the adiabatic  
exponent /u1D̅05 and the pressure diﬀerence between the inside ( |u1D4JD|u1D4J6Cst) and the outside 
(|u1D4JD|u1D44∆Cst) of the membrane.  For subsonic ﬂow it is formulat ed as:  
/u1D6F∫=/radical.v6/u1D̅05
/u1D̅05− 1|<racketleftCv6|parenleftCvJ|u1D4JD|u1D44∆Cst
|u1D4JD|u1D4J6Cst|parenriµhtCvJ|twoCsts
/u1D̅05.sts
− |parenleftCvJ|u1D4JD|u1D44∆Cst
|u1D4JD|u1D4J6Cst|parenriµhtCvJ/u1D̅05.sts+|oneCsts
/u1D̅05.sts
|<racketriµhtCv6 
and for sonic or critical ﬂow as: 
 /u1D6F∫=/radical.v6/u1D̅05
2|parenleftCvJ2
/u1D̅05+ 1|parenriµhtCvJ/u1D̅05.sts+|oneCsts

2-334 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 the Green-Lagrange strain used in the formulae in Remark 1  above is substitut- 
ed with  
/u1D404̃=/u1D404− [1 − |u1D6F+(|u1D461)]/u1D404|zeroCst, 
where /u1D404|zeroCst is the strain at time zero.  This is done in order  to smoothly initialize 
the stress resulting from using a reference geometr y diﬀerent from the geome- 
try at time zero. 
4.  Dissipative Effects.   The factor |u1D6F∆ is a function of the strain history and is 
initially set to unity.  It depends, more speciﬁcal ly, on the internal work /u1D̅16 given 
by the stress power 
/u1D̅16̇=/u1D412∶/u1D404̇. 
The evolution of |u1D6F∆ is related to the stress power since it will incre ase on load- 
ing and decrease on unloading, and as a result it i ntroduces dissipation.  The 
exact mathematical formula is too complicated to re veal, but basically the func- 
tion looks like 
|u1D6F∆ =/˙raceleft.v61 −/u1D4:B(|u1D4J2̅/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st ) +/u1D4:B(|u1D4J2̅/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st )exp|<racketleftCv1|u1D6FD(/u1D̅16−/u1D̅16)|<racketriµhtCv1/u1D̅16̇< 0
1 −/u1D4:B(|u1D4J2̅/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st )exp|<racketleftCv1−|u1D6FD(/u1D̅16−/u1D̅16)|<racketriµhtCv1/u1D̅16̇≥ 0 
Here /u1D̅16 is the maximum attained internal work up to this p oint in time, |u1D4J2̅/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st  and 
|u1D4J2̅/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st  are the engineering strain values associated with value. /u1D4:B(|u1D4J2̅/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st ) is the 
hysteresis factor deﬁned by the user through the in put parameter TH; it may or 
may not depend on the strains. |u1D6FD is a decay constant that depends on |u1D4J2̅/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st  and 
|u1D4J2̅/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st , and /u1D̅16 is the minimum attained internal work at any point  in time after /u1D̅16 
was attained.  In other words, on unloading |u1D6F∆ will exponentially decay to 1 −
/u1D4:B, and on loading it will exponentially grow to 1 an d always be restricted by 
the lower and upper bounds, 1 −/u1D4:B< |u1D6F∆ ≤ 1 . The only thing the user needs to 
care about is to input a proper hysteresis factor /u1D4:B, and with reference to a gen- 
eral loading/unloading cycle illustrated in Figure M34M-1  the relation 1 −/u1D4:B=
/u1D̅16|u1D462Cst//u1D̅16|u1D4J9Cst should hold. 
5.  Packing of Yarn in Compression.   To account for the packing of yarns in 
compression, a compaction eﬀect is modeled by addin g a term to the strain 
energy function of the form  Figure M34M-1.   Cyclic loading model for hysteresis model H *.  for details.  FORM = 0 was used since R8 and
