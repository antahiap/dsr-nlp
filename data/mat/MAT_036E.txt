 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density. 
E Young’s modulus, |u1D438. 
PR Poisson’s ratio, ν. 
LCH XX  Load curve/table deﬁning uniaxial stress vs.  uniax ial strain and 
strain rate in the given direction ( XX  is either 00, 45,90 ). The exact 
deﬁnition is discussed in the Remarks below.  LCH00  must be 
deﬁned, the other defaults to LCH00 if not deﬁned. 
LCHBI Load curve/table deﬁning biaxial stress vs.  biaxia l strain and 
strain rate, see discussion in the Remarks below fo r a deﬁnition.  
If not deﬁned this is determined from LCH00 and the  initial R-
values to yield a response close to the standard 3- param eter 
Barlat model. 
LCHSH Load curve/table deﬁning shear stress vs.  shear st rain and strain 
rate, see discussion in the Remarks below for a deﬁ nition.  If not 
deﬁned this is ignored to yield a response close to  the standard 3-
parameter Barlat model. 
HOSF Hosford option for enhancing convexity of yield sur face, set to 1 
to activate. 
LCR XX  Load curve deﬁning standard R- value vs.  uniaxial strain in the 
given direction ( XX  is either 00, 45, 90).  The exact deﬁnition is 
discussed in the Remarks below.  Default is a const ant R- value of 
1.0, a negative input will result in a constant R-v alue of –LCRXX. *.  
LS-DYNA R13 2-361 (MAT) Formulation: 
The standard 3-parameter Barlat model incorporates plastic anisotropy in a fairly 
moderate sense, allowing for the speciﬁcation of R- values in three diﬀerent directions, 
together with a stress level in the reference direc tion (termed rolling  or 0 degree  
direction), but not more than that.  To allow for a  more accurate representation of a 
more severe anisotropic material, like in rolled al uminium sheet components, one could 
migrate to the Barlat YLD2000 model (material 133 i n LS-DYNA) which also allows for 
specifying stress levels in the two remaining direc tions as well as stress and strain data 
at an arbitrary point on the yield surface.  The pr operties of extruded aluminium 
however, are such that neither of these two materia l models are suﬃcient to describe its 
extreme anisotropy.  One particular observation fro m experiments is that anisotropy 
evolves with deformation, a feature that is not cap tured in any of the material models 
discussed so far.  The present extended version of material 36 was therefore developed 
in an attempt to ﬁll this void in the LS-DYNA mater ial library.  In short, this material 
allows for R-values and stress levels in the three directions, together with similar data in 
biaxial and shear directions. And , these properties are functions of the eﬀective pl astic 
strain so as to allow for deformation induced aniso tropy.  The following is an 
explanation of its parameters. 
 
The hardening curves or tables LCH00, LCH45 and LCH 90 are here deﬁned as 
measured stress as function of measured plastic str ain (and potentially rate) for uniaxial 
tension in the direction of interest, i.e., as dete rmined from experimental testing using a 
standard procedure.  The optional biaxial and shear  hardening curves LCHBI and 
LCHSH require some further elaboration, as we assum e that a biaxial or shear test 
reveals that the true stress tensor in the material  system expressed as 
/u1D̅48= |parenleftCv4|u1D7≠∆ 0
0±|u1D7≠∆|parenriµhtCv4 , |u1D7≠∆ ≥ 0, 
is a function of the (plastic) strain tensor 
/u1D̅:A= |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠|oneCst 0
0±|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|parenriµhtCvJ , |u1D7≠≠|oneCst≥ 0, |u1D7≠≠|twoCst≥ 0, 
The input hardening curves are |u1D7≠∆ as function of |u1D7≠≠|oneCst+|u1D7≠≠|twoCst. The ± sign above distinguishes 
between the biaxial ( +) and the shear ( −) cases. 
 
Moreover, the curves LCR00, LCR45 and LCR90 deﬁning  the R values are as function of 
the measured plastic strain for uniaxial tension in  the direction of interest.  The R-values 
in themselves are deﬁned as the ratio of instantane ous width change to instantaneous 
thickness change.  That is, assume that the width W  and thickness T are measured as 
function of strain.  Then the corresponding R-value  is given by: 
|u1D44J/u1D̅11.st=|u1D4J1 /u1D44A 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ //u1D44A
|u1D4J1|u1D447 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ /|u1D447. *
