LS-DYNA R13 2-233 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MACF Material axes change ﬂag for brick elements: 
EQ.1: no change, default 
EQ.2: switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F. 
EQ.3: switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450. 
EQ.4: switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450. 
ATRACK Material |u1D44∆-axis tracking ﬂag (shell elements only): 
EQ.0:  |u1D44∆-axis rotates with element (default). 
EQ.1:  |u1D44∆-axis also tracks deformation (see Remark 2 ).

V1, V2, V3 Components of vector /u1D42F for AOPT = 3 and 4 
D1, D2, D3 Components of vector /u1D41D for AOPT = 2 
BETA Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 0 (shells only) and 
AOPT = 3. It may be overridden on the element card;  see *ELE-
MENT_SHELL_BETA or *ELEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO. 
SC Shear strength, |u1D44∆|u1D44F -plane; see the LS-DYNA Theory Manual. 
XT Longitudinal tensile strength, |u1D44∆-axis; see the LS-DY NA Theory 
Manual. 
YT Transverse tensile strength, |u1D44F-axis 
YC Transverse compressive strength, |u1D44F-axis (positive value) 
ALPH Shear stress parameter for the nonlinear term;  see the LS-DY NA 
Theory Manual.  Suggested range 0 – 0.5. 
SN Normal tensile strength  (solid elements only)  
SYZ Transverse shear strength  (solid elements only)  
SZX Transverse shear strength  (solid elements only)  
Remarks: 
1.  History Data.   The number of additional integration point variab les for shells 
written to the d3plot  database is speciﬁed using the *DATABASE_EXTENT_BI -*.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-235 (MAT) can rotate independently which may be more accurate , particularly for shear 
deformation.  This option is available only for she ll elements. 
3.  Poisson’s Ratio.   If EA > EB, PRBA is the minor Poisson's ratio if EA > EB, 
and the major Poisson's ratio will be equal to PRBA × (EA EB ⁄ ) .  If EB > EA, 
then PRBA is the major Poisson's ratio.  PRCA and P RCB are similarly deﬁned.  
They are the minor Poisson’s ratio if EA>EC or EB>E C, and the major Pois- 
son’s ratio if the EC > EA or EC > EB. 
Care should be taken when using material parameters  from third party prod- 
ucts regarding the directional indices |u1D44∆, |u1D44F and  /u1D450, as they may diﬀer from the 
deﬁnition used in LS-DYNA. For the direction indice s used in LS-DYNA, see 
the remarks section of *. . 
SOFT Softening reduction factor for material strength in  crashfront 
elements (default = 1.0).  TFAIL must be greater than zero to 
activate this option.  Crashfront elements are elem ents that are 
direct neighbors of failed (deleted) elements.  See  Remark 2 . 
FBRT Softening for ﬁber tensile strength: 
EQ.0.0: Tensile strength = XT  
GT.0.0: Tensile strength = XT, reduced to XT × FBRT after 
failure has occurred in compressive matrix mode 
YCFAC Reduction factor for compressive ﬁber strength afte r matrix 
compressive failure.  The compressive strength in t h e ﬁber 
direction after compressive matrix failure is reduc ed to: 
/u1D44B|u1D4J≠Cst=Y CFAC ×/u1D44C|u1D4J≠Cst, (default : Y CFAC =2.0) *. . *. . Nine damage variab les are deﬁned such that damage 
is diﬀerent in tension and compression.  These dama ge variables are applicable to |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst, 
|u1D438|u1D44FCst, |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst, |u1D43A|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst , |u1D43A|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  and |u1D43A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst . In addition, nine failure criteria on strains are  available.  When 
failure occurs, elements are deleted (erosion).  Fa ilure depends on the number of 
integration points failed through the element.  See  the material description below.
