  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
PR Poisson’s ratio.  See Remark 6 . 
G12 i Coeﬃcients for the bias-extension angle change- engineering stress 
curve in Figure M293-3 . G121 to G126 corresponds to the 6 th  order 
to 1 st  order factors of the loading curve.  See Remark 6 . 
GAMMAL Shear locking angle, in degrees.  See Remark 6 . 
VF Fiber volume fraction in the prepreg composite. 
EF3 Transverse compression modulus of the dry ﬁber.  
VF23 Transverse Poisson’s ratio of the dry ﬁber 
EM Young’s modulus of the cured resin. 
VM Poisson’s ratio of the cured resin 
EPSILON Stretch ratio at the end of undulation stage during  the uniaxial 
tension test.  Example shown in Figure M293-2 .  See Remark 6 . 
THETA Initial angle oﬀset between the ﬁber direction and the element 
direction.  To reduce simulation error, when buildi ng the model, 
the elements should be aligned to the same directio n as much as 
possible. 
BULK Bulk modulus of the prepreg material  
G Shear modulus of the prepreg material  
Remarks: 
1.  Fiber and Resin Properties.   The dry ﬁber properties, EF3 and VF23, and the 
cure resin properties, EM and VM, are used to calcu late the through thickness 
elastic modulus of the prepreg using the rule of mi xture.  These properties will 
not aﬀect the in-plane deformation of the prepreg d uring the preforming 
simulation. 
2.  Shear Locking.   In most of the preforming cases, the angle betwee n the ﬁber 
yarns will not reach the shear locking state.  This  model is not designed for, 
and, therefore, not recommended for simulating shea r locking. 
3.  History Variables.  hsv1 represents the angle between warp/weft yarns,  and 
hsv2,3 are the stretch ratio of ﬁbers in 1,2 direct ions respectively. *.   
 The uniaxial tension test is used to obtain the ﬁbe r direction undulation strains 
and the stable tensile moduli, together with the in -plane Poisson’s ratio (PR).  A 
typical test result is shown in Figure M293-2 .  From the stretch ratio-
engineering stress curve, the tensile modulus, ET, and the stretch ratio at the 
end of undulation, EPSILON, can be captured. 
The bias-extension test is used to characterize the  shear behavior of the compo- 
site needed for ﬁelds G12 |u1D4J6. The test procedure comes from the benchmark test 
literature [1].  An example of the bias-extension t est angle change-engineering 
stress curve is shown in Figure M293-3 . Undulation

 to the real experiment case.  The starting point fo r the compression modulus 
iteration can be set as about 100X of the shear mod ulus when the warp and weft 
yarns are perpendicular to each other. 
7.  Element Type.   The material model is available for shell element s with OSU=1 
and INN=2 in the CONTROL_ACCURACY card.  It is reco mmended to use a 
double precision version of LS-DYNA.
