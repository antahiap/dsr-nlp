 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material ID for which this generalized damage d eﬁnition applies 
IDAM Flag for damage model: 
EQ.0: No damage model is used. 
EQ.1: GISSMO damage model 
DTYP Flag for damage behavior: 
EQ.0: Damage is accumulated; no coupling to ﬂow stress, no 
failure. 
EQ.1: Damage is accumulated; element failure occurs for D  = 1.  
REFSZ Reference element size, for which an additional out put of damage 
will be generated.  This is necessary to ensure the  applicability of 
resulting damage quantities when transferred to diﬀ erent mesh 
sizes. 
NUMFIP Number of failed integration points prior to  element deletion.  
The default is unity. 
LT.0: |N U MFIP|  is the percentage of layers which must fail 
before the element fails. 
PDDT Pre-deﬁned damage tensors.  If non- zero, damage tensor 
coeﬃcients D11 to D66 on Cards 3 and 4 will be ignored.  See 
Remark 2 . 
EQ.0: No pre-deﬁned damage tensor is used. 
EQ.1: Isotropic damage tensor

IFLG2 Damage strain coordinate system: 
EQ.0: Local element system (shells) or global system (sol ids) 
EQ.1: Material system, only applicable for non- isotropic 
material models.  Supported models for shells: all mate- 
rials with AOPT feature.  Supported models for soli ds: 
22, 33, 41-50, 103, 122, 157, 233. 
EQ.2: Principal strain system (rotating) 
EQ.3: Principal strain system (ﬁxed when instability/coupl ing 
starts) 
IFLG3 Erosion criteria and damage coupling system: 
EQ.0: Erosion occurs when one of the damage parameters 
computed reaches unity; the damage tensor components 
are based on the individual damage parameters d1 to  d3.  
EQ.1: Erosion occurs when a single damage parameter |u1D437
reaches unity; the damage tensor components are based 
on this single damage parameter.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCSRS Load curve ID deﬁning failure history value scaling  factor for 
LCS DG as a function of history value rate.  If the ﬁrs t rate value in 
the curve is negative, it is assumed that all rate values are given 
as natural logarithm of the history rate. 
GT.0: Scale ECRIT as well. 
LT.0: Do not scale ECRIT. 
SHRF Reduction factors for regularization at triaxi ality = 0 (shear) 
BIAXF Reduction factors for regularization at triax iality = 2/3 (biaxial) 
LCDLIM Load curve ID deﬁning damage limit values as a func tion of 
triaxiality.  Damage can be restricted to values le ss than 1.0 to 
prevent further stress reduction and failure for ce rtain 
triaxialities. 
MIDFAIL Mid-plane failure option for shell elements .  If active, then critical 
strain is only checked at the mid- plane integration point, meaning 
an odd number for NIP should be used.  Damage is co mputed at *MAT  *.   *MAT  
LS-DYNA R13 2-93 (MAT) 2.  Damage Tensor.   The relation between nominal (damaged) stresses |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  and

with damage tensor /u1D40:. Each damage tensor coeﬃcient |u1D437|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  can be deﬁned using 
*DEFINE_FUNCTION as a function of damage parameters  |u1D4J1|oneCst to |u1D4J1|threeCst. For simple 
isotropic damage driven by plastic strain (NHIS = 1 , HIS1 = 0, 
IFLG1 = IFLG2 = IFLG3 = 0) that would be

That means the following function should be deﬁned for D11 to D66 (Card 3): 
*DEFINE_FUNCTION 
1,D11toD66 
func1(d1,d2,d3)=(1.0-d1)  
and all entries in Card 4 can be left empty or equa l to zero in that case.  
If GISSMO (IDAM = 1) is used, the damage parameters  used in those functions 
are internally replaced by 
|u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst    →      |parenleftCvJ|u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst− DCRIT |u1D4J6Cst

In the case of plane stress (shell) elements, coupl ing between normal stresses 
and shear stresses is implemented and the damage te nsor is deﬁned as below: 
⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎡|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst

Since the evaluation of *DEFINE_FUNCTION for variab les D11 to D66 is rela- 
tively time consuming, pre-deﬁned damage tensors (P DDT) can be used.  Cur- 
rently the following options are available for shel l elements:

3.  History Variables.   The increment of the damage parameter is computed i n 
GISSMO based on a driving quantity that has the dim ension of a strain rate:  
|u1D4J1̇= |u1D4JB|u1D4J1|oneCst−|oneCst/|u1D4JBCstH IS /u1D6A4̇
epf  
The history variables deﬁned by the user through HI S i should thus have the 
dimension of a strain as the rate is computed inter nally by

The following example deﬁnes a history variable (HI S i = -1234) as function of 
the transverse shear strains in material coordinate  system (|u1D44∆, |u1D44F,/u1D46̅) for shells: 
*DEFINE_FUNCTION 
      1234 
fhis1(eaa,ebb,ezz,eab,ebz,eza)=1.1547*sqrt(ebz**2+e za**2)  
The plastic strain rate tensor is not always availa ble in the material law and is 
estimated as: 
/u1D6C6̇|u1D4JDCst=|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45:.st/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45:.st/u1D45:.st|<racketleftCvJ/u1D6C6̇−|u1D7≠≠̇/u1D4∫̅/u1D4∫0/u1D48D
3/u1D6C5|<racketriµhtCvJ 
This is a good approximation for isochoric material s with small elastic strains 
(such as metals) and correct for J2 plasticity.

menting the damage in function of the input paramet ers (strain superscript “p”
