The linear polynomial equation of state may be used  to model gas with the 
gamma law equation of state.  This may be achieved by setting: 
|u1D436|zeroCst= |u1D436|oneCst= |u1D436|twoCst= |u1D436|threeCst= |u1D436|sixCst= 0 
and 
|u1D436|fourCst= |u1D436|fiveCst= |u1D6F∆ − 1 
where  
|u1D6F∆ =|u1D436|u1D4JDCst
|u1D436|u1D463Cst 
is the ratio of speciﬁc heats.  Pressure for a perf ect gas is then given by: 
|u1D443 = (|u1D6F∆ − 1)|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst|u1D438 = (|u1D6F∆ − 1)|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts
|u1D463|u1D4JFCst 
|u1D438 has the units of pressure (where |u1D438 = |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts and |u1D463|u1D4JFCst= |u1D7≠+|zeroCst|u1D7≠+ ⁄). 
2.  Initial Pressure.   When |u1D436|zeroCst= |u1D436|oneCst= |u1D436|twoCst= |u1D436|threeCst= |u1D436|sixCst= 0, it does not necessarily 
mean that the initial pressure is zero ( |u1D4430≠ |u1D436 0!).  The initial pressure depends 
on the values of all the coeﬃcients and on |u1D7≠7|dividesCv1|u1D461=0 and |u1D438|dividesCv1|u1D461=0.  The pressure in a 
material is computed from the whole equation above,  |u1D443 = |u1D443(µ, |u1D438) .  It is always 
preferable to initialize the initial condition base d on |u1D7≠7|dividesCv1|u1D461=0 and |u1D438|dividesCv1|u1D461=0.  The use of 
|u1D436|zeroCst= |u1D436|oneCst= |u1D436|twoCst= |u1D436|threeCst= |u1D436|sixCst= 0 must be done with caution as it may change the 
form and behavior of the material.  The safest way is to use the whole EOS 
equation to manually check for the pressure value.  For example, for an ideal 
gas, only |u1D436|fourCst and |u1D436|fiveCst are nonzero; |u1D436|fourCst and |u1D436|fiveCst are equal to |u1D6F∆ − 1 while all other 
coeﬃcients ( |u1D436|zeroCst, |u1D436|oneCst, |u1D436|twoCst, |u1D436|threeCst, and |u1D436|sixCst) are zero to satisfy the perfect gas equation 
form.  
3.  V0 and E0.   V0 and E0 deﬁned in this card must be the same as  the time-zero 
ordinates for the 2 load curves deﬁned in the *BOUN DARY_AMBIENT_EOS

Remarks: 
1.  Equation of State.   The JWL equation of state deﬁnes the pressure as 
|u1D4JD = |u1D434 |parenleftCvJ1 −|u1D714
|u1D44J|oneCst|u1D449|parenriµhtCvJ |u1D4J2−|u1D44JCst |oneCsts|u1D449Cst+ |u1D43J |parenleftCvJ1 −|u1D714
|u1D44J|twoCst|u1D449|parenriµhtCvJ |u1D4J2−|u1D44JCst |twoCsts|u1D449Cst+|u1D714|u1D438 
|u1D449, 
and is usually used for detonation products of high  explosives. 
A, B, and E0 have units of pressure.  R1, R2, OMEG,  and V0 are dimensionless.  
It is recommended that a unit system of gram, centi meter, microsecond be used 
when a model includes high explosive(s).  In this c onsistent unit system, pres- 
sure is in Mbar.    
2.  Afterburn.   The AFTERBURN option allows the addition of after burn energy 
|u1D444 to the calculation of pressure by replacing |u1D438 in the above equation with (|u1D438 +
|u1D444), that is, the last term on the right-hand side bec omes 
|u1D714(|u1D438 + |u1D444)
|u1D449 
The simple afterburn option adds the energy at a co nstant rate (OPT = 1) or a 
linearly-increasing rate (OPT = 2) between times T1  and T2 such that the total 
energy added per unit volume at time T2 is the spec iﬁed energy QT.  
For the Miller’s extension model (OPT = 3), the aft erburn energy is added us- 
ing a time-dependent growth term 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠6 
|u1D4J1|u1D461 = |u1D44∆(1 − |u1D7≠6)|u1D4JACst|u1D4JD|u1D4JBCst,         |u1D444 = |u1D7≠6|u1D444|zeroCst  . 
Here, |u1D4JA, |u1D4JB, and |u1D7≠6 are dimensionless, with |u1D7≠6 a positive fraction less than 1.0. The 
parameter |u1D44∆ has units consistent with this growth equation, an d |u1D444|zeroCst has units of 
pressure. *EOS_JWL  *EOS  
LS-DYNA R13 1-13 (EOS) The values for |u1D444|zeroCst, |u1D44∆, |u1D4JA, |u1D4JB published by Miller and Guirguis (1993) are calibr at- 
ed in the units of g, cm, µs, with the consistent p ressure unit of Mbar, though 
in principle any consistent set of units may be use d for calibration.  The factors 
CONM, CONL, and CONT convert the unit system of the  model being ana- 
lyzed to the calibration unit system in which the M iller’s extension parameters 
are speciﬁed, such that a mass value in model units  may be multiplied by 
CONM to obtain the corresponding value in calibrati on units.  These conver- 
sion factors allow consistent evaluation of the gro wth equation in the calibrat- 
ed units.  For user convenience, predeﬁned conversi on factors are provided for 
converting various choices for the model units syst em to the calibration unit 
system used by Miller and Guirguis.

tensor).
