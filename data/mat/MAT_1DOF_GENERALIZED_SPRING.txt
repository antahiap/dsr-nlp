This is Material Type 146.  This is a linear spring  or damper that allows diﬀerent 
degrees-of-freedom at two nodes to be coupled.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density; see also volume in *SECTION_BEAM d eﬁnition. 
K Spring stiﬀness 
C Damping constant 
SCLN1 Scale factor on force at node 1.  Default = 1 .0. 
SCLN2 Scale factor on force at node 2.  Default = 1 .0. 
DOFN1 Active degree-of- freedom at node 1, a number between 1 to 6 
where 1, 2 and 3 are the |u1D46J, |u1D466, and /u1D46̅-translations and 4, 5, and 6 are 
the |u1D46J, |u1D466, and /u1D46̅-rotations.  If this parameter is deﬁned in the *SE C-
TION_BEAM deﬁnition or on the *ELEMENT_BEAM_S CALAR 
card, then the value here, if deﬁned, is ignored. 
DOFN2 Active degree-of- freedom at node 2, a number between 1 to 6 
where 1, 2 and 3 are the |u1D46J, |u1D466, and /u1D46̅-translations and 4, 5, and 6 are 
the |u1D46J, |u1D466, and /u1D46̅-rotations.  If this parameter is deﬁned in the *SE C-
TION_BEAM deﬁnition or on the *ELEMENT_BEAM_ SCALAR 
card, then the value here, if deﬁned, is ignored. *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
CID1 Local coordinate system at node 1.  This coordinate  system can be 
overwritten by a local system speciﬁed on the *ELEM ENT_-
BEAM_SCALAR or *SECTION_ BEAM keyword input.  If no 
coordinate system is speciﬁed, the global system is  used. 
CID2 Local coordinate system at node 2.  If CID2 = 0, CID2 = CID1. *
