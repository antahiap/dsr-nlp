EQ.0: Equivalent plastic strain rate is the driving quant ity for 
the damage if IFLG1 = 0. Alternatively, if IFLG1 = 1, 
components of the plastic strain rate tensor are driving 
quantities for damage (see Remarks 2  and 3).

Viscoelasticity 
 
In the absence of viscoelasticity, we are now done with the description of the stress 
update, and we simply set 
/u1D4∫4/u1D4:C.st=/u1D4∫4
|u1D4JD/u1D4:C.st= |u1D4JD 
where we use /u1D4∫4/u1D4:C.st and |u1D4JD/u1D4:C.st to denote the ﬁnal deviatoric stress and pressure in link /u1D4:C that is 
used in the weighted sum at the beginning of this s ection.  The /u1D4∫4 and |u1D4JD are to be 
understood as the deviatoric stress and pressure re sulting from treatment of creep and 
plasticity that we just covered, so /u1D̅48=/u1D4∫4− |u1D4JD/u1D4̅0. For viscoelasticity the stress in link /u1D4:C will 
be subject to stress decay (relaxation and creep), in that it evolves according to the 
speciﬁed viscoelastic law.  For deviatoric and volu metric decay coeﬃcients |u1D6FD|u1D46≠Cst and |u1D6FD|u1D4JDCst, 
we have for the hypoelastic law (MODEL = 1) 
/u1D4∫4/u1D4:C.st/na˙la.st=/u1D4∫4/na˙la.st− |u1D6FD|u1D46≠Cst/u1D4∫4/u1D4:C.st
|u1D4JḊ/u1D4:C.st= |u1D4JḊ− |u1D6FD|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JD/u1D4:C.st 
The hyperelastic laws are formulated directly in te rms of the Kirchhoﬀ stress /u1D̅4∫=/u1D4:D/u1D̅48, 
where /u1D4:D= det /u1D46D. More speciﬁcally, using the notation /u1D45E= −|oneCst

5.  CDF for Viscosity.   CDF can be used to consider the viscosity eﬀect f or high 
speed air ﬂow. 
6.  Nonlinearity.   LCPGD i can be used to deﬁne a non-linear Darcy’s law as 
follows: 
(CDARC Y + CDF × ||u1D463|u1D4J6Cst|) × PORE × |u1D463|u1D4J6Cst= PERM|u1D4J6 × |u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst|u1D71J|u1D443|u1D44∆Cst
|u1D71J|u1D46J|u1D4J6Cst, |u1D4J6 = 1,2,3 
where |u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst is the value of the function deﬁned by the LCPGD i ﬁeld.  The linear 
version of Darcy’s law (see Remark 2 ) can be recovered when the LCPGD i 
curves are deﬁned as straight lines of slope of 1. *. 39.

5.  Nonlinear Strain Paths.   When the keyword option NLP_FAILURE is used, a 
necking failure criterion independent of strain pat h changes is activated.  In 
sheet metal forming, as strain path history (plotte d on in-plane major and mi- 
nor strain space) of an element becomes non-linear,  the position and shape of a 
traditional strain-based Forming Limit Diagram (FLD ) changes.  This option 
provides a simple formability index (F.I.) which re mains invariant regardless 
of the presence of the non-linear strain paths in t he model and can be used to 
identify if the element has reached its necking lim it. Equivalent strain

UNIAXIAL 
The UNIAXIAL keyword option causes the transverse s tresses and transverse strains to 
be zero for solid spot welds.  The older uniaxial m ethod, invoked with E < 0.0 on 
Card 1, assumed only the transverse stresses are ze ro.  Compared to the older method, 
the UNIAXIAL keyword option increases the stability  of the solver.  See Remark 2  for

EQ.1: TRUE_T behavior of version R8 and earlier 
EQ.2:  Same as 1 but also includes weld failure that is in variant 
with respect to the node numbering of weld elements .  *. 00  
 2.  Loading Solid Welds Uniaxially.   We have implemented two methods of 
loading solid and solid weld assemblies uniaxially.   The older method is in- 
voked by deﬁning the elastic modulus, |u1D438, as a negative number where the ab- 
solute value of |u1D438 is the desired value for |u1D438.  This uniaxial option causes the two 
transverse stress terms to be assumed to be zero th roughout the calculation.  
This assumption eliminates parasitic transverse str ess that causes slow growth 
of plastic strain-based damage.  
The other method is invoked by setting OPTION2  to UNIAXIAL. This method 
is preferred.  It causes the two transverse stress terms and the two transverse 
strains terms to be set to zero.  It was added beca use we found that the older 
method sometimes induced spurious oscillations in t he axial force, leading to 
premature failure.  
The motivation for the uniaxial options can be expl ained with a weld loaded in 
tension.  Due to Poisson’s eﬀect, an element in ten sion would be expected to 
contract in the transverse directions.  However, be cause the weld nodes are 
constrained to the mid-plane of shell elements, suc h contraction is only possi- 
ble to the degree that the shell element contracts.   In other words, the uniaxial 
stress state cannot be represented by the weld.  Fo r plastic strain-based dam- 
age, this eﬀect can be particularly apparent as it causes tensile stress to contin- 
ue to grow very large as the stress state becomes v ery nearly triaxial tension.  
In this stress state, plastic strain grows very slo wly so it appears that damage 
calculation is failing to knock down the stress.  B y simply assuming that the 
transverse stresses are zero, the plastic strain gr ows as expected and damage is 
much more eﬀective. 
3.  NF.   NF speciﬁes the number of terms used to ﬁlter the  stresses or resultants 
used in the OPT failure criterion.  NF cannot excee d 30.  The default value is set 
to zero which is generally recommended unless oscil latory resultant forces are 
observed in the time history databases.  Although w elds should not oscillate 
signiﬁcantly, this option was added for consistency  with the other spot weld 
options.  NF aﬀects the storage since it is necessa ry to store the resultant forces 
as history variables.  The NF parameter is availabl e only for beam element 
welds. 
4.  Time Scaling.   The inertias of the spot welds are scaled during the ﬁrst time 
step so that their stable time step size is ∆|u1D461.  A strong compressive load on the 
spot weld at a later time may reduce the length of the spot weld so that stable 
time step size drops below ∆|u1D461. If the value of ∆|u1D461 is zero, mass scaling is not per- 
formed, and the spot welds will probably limit the time step size.  Under most 
circumstances, the inertias of the spot welds are s mall enough that scaling 
them will have a negligible eﬀect on the structural  response and the use of this 
option is encouraged. *. 00  
 where |u1D461failure  is the time at which damage initiates, and |u1D461rupture = RS .  For 
DMGOPT = 2, |u1D461failure  is set equal to the time at which |u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst exceeds EFAIL.  
For DMGOPT = 12,  |u1D461failure  is set equal to either the time when |u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst exceeds 
EFAIL or the time when the failure criterion is met , whichever occurs ﬁrst. 
If DMGOPT = 0, 1, or 2, inputting EFAIL = 0 will ca use damage to initiate as 
soon as the weld stress reaches the yield surface.  Prior to version 9.1, inputting 
EFAIL = 0 for DMGOPT = 10, 11, 12 would similarly c ause damage to initiate 
when the stress state reaches the yield surface, bu t version 9.1 and later will 
ignore EFAIL = 0 and only initiate damage when the failure criterion is met.  If 
the eﬀective plastic strain is zero when damage ini tiates by the failure criterion, 
then the yield stress of the weld is reduced to the  current eﬀective stress so that 
the stress state is on the yield surface and plasti c strain can start to grow. 
For DMGOPT = 1, the damage behavior is the same as for DMGOPT = 0, but 
an additional damage variable is calculated to prev ent stress growth during 
softening.  Similarly, DMGOPT = 11 behaves like DMG OPT = 10 except for the 
additional damage variable.  This additional functi on is also used with DM-
GOPT = 2 and 12.  The eﬀect of this additional dama ge function is noticed only 
in brick and brick assembly welds in tension loadin g where it prevents growth 
of the tensile force in the weld after damage initi ates.  
For DMGOPT = 10, 11, or 12 an optional FMODE parame ter determines 
whether a weld that reaches the failure surface wil l fail immediately or initiate 
damage.  The failure surface calculation has shear terms, which may include 
the torsional moment as well as normal and bending terms.   If FMODE is in- 
put with a value between 0 and 1, then when the fai lure surface is reached, the 
sum of the square of the shear terms is divided by the sum of the square of all 
terms.  If this ratio exceeds FMODE, then the weld will fail immediately.  If the 
ratio is less than or equal to FMODE, then damage w ill initiate.  The FMODE 
option is available only for brick and brick assemb ly welds.  
For resultant based failure (OPT = -1 or 0) and DMG OPT = 10, 11, or 12 an op- 
tional FFCAP parameter determines whether a weld th at reaches the failure 
surface will fail immediately.  After damage initia tion, the failure function can 
reach values above 1.0. This can now be limited by the FFCAP value (should be 
larger than 1.0):

 Label Attributes Description  
Instability - - - - A measure between 0 and 1 related to how 
close the spotweld element is to fail 
Damage - - - - Damage in the spotweld element betwe en 0 
and 1 
These two labels are supported for all options (OPT  and DMGOPT, including 
assemblies and beams), except for user deﬁned failu re.  The instability measure 
is the maximum over time; namely, it gives the maxi mum value for a given 
element throughout the simulation.  If a damage opt ion is invoked, then dam- 
age will initiate and increment when the instabilit y reaches unity, and elements 
are not deleted until the damage value reaches unit y.  If no damage option is 
invoked, then the damage output is always zero and elements will be deleted 
at the point when the instability measure reaches u nity

2.  Connection Properties.  This weld material is modeled with isotropic 
hardening plasticity.  The yield stress and constan t hardening modulus are 
assumed to be those of the welded shell elements as  deﬁned in a *DEFINE_-

data also deﬁne a failure function and the damage t ype.  The interpretation of 
EFAIL and RS is determined by the choice of damage type.  This is discussed in 
Remark 4 on *DEFINE_CONNECTION_PROPERTIES. 
3.  Solid Weld Element Thickness.  Solid weld elements are tied to the mid-plane 
of shell materials and so typically have a thicknes s that is half the sum of the 
thicknesses of the welded shell sections.  As a res ult, a weld under shear load- 
ing can be subject to an artiﬁcially large moment w hich will be balanced by 
normal forces transferred through the tied contact.   These normal forces will 
cause the normal term in the failure calculation to  be artiﬁcially high.  Input- 
ting a TRUE_T that is smaller than the modeled thic kness, for example, 10%-
30% of true thickness will scale down the normal fo rce that results from the 
balancing moment and provide more realistic failure  calculations.  TRUE_T 
eﬀects only the failure calculation, not the weld e lement behavior.  If TRUE_-
T = 0 or data is omitted, the modeled weld element thickness is used. 
4.  Weld Assembly Failure.  For weld elements in an assembly (see RPBHX on 
*CONTROL_SPOTWELD_BEAM or *DEFINE_HEX_SPOTWELD_ASSE M-
BLY), the failure criterion is evaluated using the assembly cross section.  If 
damage is not active, all elements will be deleted when the failure criterion is 
met.  If damage is active, then damage is calculate d independently in each 
element of the assembly.  By default, elements of t he assembly are deleted as 
damage in each element is complete.  If ASFF = 1, t hen failure and deletion of 
all elements in the assembly will occur simultaneou sly when damage is com- 
plete in any one of the elements.

Remarks: 
1.  Standard Isotropic Damage Model (FLAG = 0 or 1).  The Continuum 
Damage Mechanics (CDM) model is based on an approac h proposed by Le- 
maitre [1992].  The eﬀective stress |u1D7≠∆̃, which is the stress calculated over the 
section that eﬀectively resist the forces, reads 
|u1D7≠∆̃=|u1D7≠∆
1 − |u1D437 
where |u1D437 is the damage variable.  The evolution equation fo r the damage varia- 
ble is deﬁned as 
|u1D437̇=
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧0 for |u1D7≠≠|eCst /f.st/f.st|u1D4JDCst≤ |u1D7≠≠|eCst /f.st/f.st/co⋯⋯a.st/d.st|u1D4JDCst

where |u1D7≠≠|eCst /f.st/f.st/co⋯⋯a.st/d.st|u1D4JDCst is the damage threshold, |u1D446 is the so-called damage energy release 
rate, and |u1D7≠∆|oneCst is the maximum principal stress.  The damage energ y density re- 
lease rate is  
/u1D44C=1

2|u1D438(1 − |u1D437)|twoCst 
where |u1D438 is Young’s modulus and |u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst|u1D4JACst  is the equivalent von Mises stress.  The 
triaxiality function |u1D44J|u1D463Cst is deﬁned as  
|u1D44J|u1D463Cst=2

 *. 04  
 In the anisotropic damage formulation, |u1D437|oneCst(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst) and |u1D437|twoCst(|u1D7≠≠|twoCst) are anisotropic 
damage functions for the loading directions 1 and 2 , respectively.  Stresses 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst|zeroCst , |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst|zeroCst , |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst|zeroCst , |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|threeCst|zeroCst  and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|threeCst|zeroCst  are stresses in the principal shell strain directi ons 
as calculated from the undamaged elastic-plastic ma terial behavior.  The 
strains |u1D7≠≠|oneCst and |u1D7≠≠|twoCst are the magnitude of the principal strains calcula ted upon 
reaching the damage thresholds.  Damage can only de velop for tensile stresses, 
and the damage functions |u1D437|oneCst(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst) and |u1D437|twoCst(|u1D7≠≠|twoCst)are identical to zero for negative 
strains |u1D7≠≠|oneCst and |u1D7≠≠|twoCst. The principal strain directions are ﬁxed within an  integration 
point as soon as either principal strain exceeds th e initial threshold strain in 
tension.  A more detailed description of the damage  evolution for this material 
model is given in the description of Material 81. 
5.  Anisotropic Viscoplasticity. The uniaxial stress-strain curve is given in the 
following form 
|u1D7≠∆|parenleftCv2|u1D4JF, |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D444|oneCst|<racketleftCv11 − exp(−|u1D436|oneCst|u1D4JF)|<racketriµhtCv1 + |u1D444|twoCst|<racketleftCv11 − exp(−|u1D436|twoCst|u1D4JF)|<racketriµhtCv1 + |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst|u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst|u1D449Cst/u1D45A.sts , 
where |u1D4JF is the damage accumulated plastic strain, which ca n be calculated by 
|u1D4JḞ= |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst(1 − |u1D437) . 
For bricks the following yield criterion associated  with the Hill criterion is used 
|u1D439(|u1D7≠∆̃|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D7≠∆̃|threeCst|threeCst )|twoCst+ |u1D43A(|u1D7≠∆̃|threeCst|threeCst − |u1D7≠∆̃|oneCst|oneCst )|twoCst+/u1D4:B(|u1D7≠∆̃|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D7≠∆̃|twoCst|twoCst )|twoCst

where |u1D4JF is the damage eﬀective viscoplastic strain and |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective visco- 
plastic strain rate.  For shells the anisotropic be havior is given by the R-values: 
|u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst , |u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst , and |u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst .  When |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst= 0, the material will behave as an elastoplastic 
material without rate eﬀects.  Default values for t he anisotropic constants are 
given by: 
|u1D439 = |u1D43A =/u1D4:B=1
2
/u1D4:F= |u1D44≠ =/u1D441=3
2
|u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst = |u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst = |u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst = 1 
so that isotropic behavior is obtained. 
Strain rate is accounted for using the Cowper and S ymonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor: 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2

least 2 points should be deﬁned.  The ﬁrst point mu st be zero 
corresponding to the initial yield stress.  WARN ING: If the ﬁrst 
point is nonzero, the yield stress is extrapolated to dete rmine the 
initial yield.  If this option is used, SIGY and ET AN are ignored 
and may be input as zero. 
ES1 - ES8 Corresponding yield stress values to EPS1  - EPS8. 
Remarks: 
By deﬁning the tangent modulus ETAN, the stress str ain behavior is treated using a 
bilinear stress strain curve.  Alternately, a curve  similar to that shown in Figure M10-1  is 
expected to be deﬁned by (EPS1, ES1)  - (EPS 8, ES 8); however, an eﬀective stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain curve (LCSS) ma y be input instead if eight points are 
insuﬃcient.  The cost is roughly the same for eithe r approach.  The most general 
approach is to use the table deﬁnition (LCSS) discu ssed below. 
 
Three options to account for strain rate eﬀects are  possible. 
1.  Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  , 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate, |u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
2.  For complete generality a load curve (LCSR) to sca le the yield stress may be 
input instead.  In this curve the scale factor as a  function of strain rate is de- 
ﬁned.   
3.  If diﬀerent stress as a function of strain curves can be provided for various 
strain rates, the option using the reference to a t able (LCSS) can be used.  Then 
the table input in *DEFINE_TABLE must be used; see Figure M24-1 .*. 13

variable 1.

temperature scale.  For example, TA0 is - 273.15 if the Celsius scale 
is used and 0.0 if the Kelvin scale is used.

VM0 The initial volume fraction of martensite 0.0 <  |u1D449|u1D4JACst|zeroCst < 1.0  may be 
initialised using two diﬀerent methods: 
GT.0.0: |u1D449|u1D4JACst|zeroCst is set to VM0. 
LT.0.0: Can be used only when there are initial plastic str ains 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst present, such as when using *INITIAL_STRESS_-
SHELL. The absolute value of VM0 is then the load 
curve ID for a function |u1D4J3 that sets |u1D449|u1D4JACst|zeroCst= |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1. The 
function |u1D4J3 must be a monotonically nondecreasing 
function of |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst.

 The parameters |u1D4JD and |u1D43J should fulﬁll the following condition 
1 + |u1D43J
|u1D43J< |u1D4JD  . 
If the condition is not fulﬁlled, then the martensi te rate will approach inﬁnity as |u1D449|u1D4JACst 
approaches zero.  Setting the parameter |u1D7≠≠|zeroCst larger than zero (typical range 0.001 - 0.02) is 
recommended.  Apart from the eﬀective true strain a  few additional history variables 
are output; see below.

 Remarks: 
1.  Failure Criterion.   When the catastrophic failure criterion is satisﬁ ed, the 
discrete element is deleted.  Failure for this mate rial depends directly on the 
displacement resultants.  The failure criterion dep ends on the value of FCRIT.  
If FCRIT = 0.0, failure occurs if either of the fol lowing inequalities are satisﬁed: 
|u1D434|u1D461Cst− 1 ≥ 0
|u1D434|u1D4J≠Cst− 1 ≥ 0

Positive (tension) values of displacement and rotat ion are considered in the 
ﬁrst criterion and negative (compression) values in  the second.  Either the ten- 
sion failure or the compression failure or both may  be used.  If any of the input 
failure displacements and rotations (UTFAILR etc) a re left as zero, the corre- 
sponding terms will be omitted from the equations f or A t and A c above.   
If FCRIT = 1.0, then a single criterion is used: 
|u1D434|u1D461Cst+ |u1D434|u1D4J≠Cst− 1 ≥ 0 
Thus, the combined eﬀect of all the displacements a nd rotations is considered, 
be they positive or negative. 
2.  Force.   There are two formulations for calculating the fo rce.  The ﬁrst is the 
standard displacement formulation, where, for examp le, the force in a linear 
spring is 
|u1D439 = −|u1D43∆∆ ℓ 
for a change in length of the beam of ∆ ℓ. The second formulation is based on 
the linear strain, giving a force of 
|u1D439 = −|u1D43∆∆ ℓ
ℓ|zeroCst 
for a beam with an initial length of ℓ|zeroCst. This option is useful when there are 
springs of diﬀerent lengths but otherwise similar c onstruction since it automat- *. 20

where |u1D437|oneCst, |u1D437|twoCst, |u1D437|threeCst and |u1D437|fourCst are the Johnson-Cook failure parameters and Λ is a function 
for including mesh-size dependency.  An alternative  expression can be used, where the 
ﬁrst term of the above equation (including D1, D2 a nd D3) is replaced by a general 
function LCJC which depends on triaxiality 
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st= LCJC × |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆|u1D43BCst

The Johnson-Cook damage parameter |u1D437/u1D45:.st is calculated with the following evolution 
equation:

|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st  . 
where ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4J9Cst  is the increment in eﬀective plastic strain.  The material fails when |u1D437/u1D45:.st 
reaches 1.0.  A more general (non-linear) damage ev olution is possible if |u1D44≠ > 1  is

1.  Hill’s 1948 Yield Criterion.  Hill’s yield criterion is based on the assumptions 
that the material is orthotropic, that hydrostatic stress does not aﬀect yielding, 
and that there is no Bauschinger eﬀect.  According to Hill, when the principal 
axes of anisotropy are the axes of reference, the y ield surface has the form 
|u1D4J3 = |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt(/u1D̅48) − |u1D7≠∆yield |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 = 0,

anisotropy, assuming three mutually orthogonal plan es of symmetry at every 
point.  The material /u1D46̅-direction is the reference direction.

natural log of strain rate when the lowest strain r ate and highest 
strain rate diﬀer by several orders of magnitude.  There is some 
additional computational cost associated with invok ing 
logarithmic interpolation. 
LCSR Load curve ID deﬁning strain rate scaling eﬀec t on yield stress 
VP Formulation for rate eﬀects: 
EQ.0.0: Scale yield stress (default) 
EQ.1.0: Viscoplastic formulation (recommended) 
EPSTHIN Thinning strain at failure.  To specify thinning st rain to failure as 
a function of plastic strain rate, see LCTSRF. 
GT.0.0: Total thinning strain (as in ISTUPD = 1; see *CON-
TROL_SHELL) 
LT.0.0: Plastic thinning strain |EPST H IN | (as in ISTUPD = 4) 
EPSMAJ Major in plane strain at failure for shells (or) ma jor principal 
strain at failure for solids (see Remark 1 ). 
LT.0: EPSMAJ = |EPSMAJ| and ﬁltering is activated.  The last 
twelve values of the major strain is stored at each  integra- 
tion point and the average value is used to determi ne 
failure. 
NUMINT Number of integration points which must fail before  the element 
is deleted.  (If zero, all points must fail.)  For fully integrated shell 
formulations, each of the 4 × NIP integration points are counted 
individually in determining a total for failed inte gration points.  
NIP is the number of through- thickness integration points.  As 
NU MINT approaches the total number of integration poi nts (NIP 
for under integrated shells, 4 × NIP for fully integrated shells), the 
chance of instability increases. 
LT.0.0: |N U MINT|  is the percentage of integration 
points/layers which must fail before the shell elem ent 
fails.  For fully integrated shells, a methodology is used 
where a l ayer fails if one integration point fails and then 
the given percentage of layers must fail before the  ele- 
ment fails.  Only available for shells.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCTSRF Curve that deﬁnes the thinning strain at failure as  a function of 
the plastic strain rate ( The curve should not extrapolate to zero or 
failure may occur at low strain. ) If LCT SRF is given, the absolute 
value of EP STHIN is unimportant; however, the algebraic sign o f 
EPSTHIN governs whether ordinate values in curve LC T SRF are 
interpreted as total or plastic thinning strain.  F or example, if 
plastic thinning strain should be used, then EP STHIN should be 
input as a negative value.

LCEMOD Load curve ID deﬁning Young’s mod ulus as function of eﬀective 
strain rate.  LCEMOD ≠ 0 activates viscoelasticity.   See *. 23  *. 23  
 The value of |u1D4J3damage  is stored as history variable #9 and can be fringe  plotted 
from d3plot  ﬁles if the number of extra history variables requ ested is ≥ 9 on 
*DATABASE_EXTENT_BINARY.  
The optional TRIAX parameter can be used to prevent  excessive RTCL damage 
growth and element erosion for badly shaped element s that might show unre- 
alistically high values for the triaxiality.  The t riaxiality, |u1D7≠∆Cst/u1D43B.sts
|u1D7≠∆Cst/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt, is stored as history 
variable #11. 
3.  Instability Indicator.  To get an idea about the probability of failure, a n 
indicator |u1D437 is computed internally: 
|u1D437 = max |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst
FAIL ,−|u1D7≠≠|threeCst
EPST H IN ,|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:C.st
EPSMAJ |parenriµhtCv6 
and stored as history variable #10.  |u1D437 ranges from 0 (intact) to 1 (failed). |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst, 
−|u1D7≠≠|threeCst, and |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:C.st are current values of eﬀective plastic strain, thi nning strain, and 
major in plane strain.  This instability measure, i ncluding the RTCL damage, 
can also be retrieved from requesting material hist ories

Implicit Calculations.   For implicit calculations with this material invo lving severe 
nonlinear hardening, the radial return method may r esult in inaccurate stress-strain 
response.  Setting IACC = 1 on *CONTROL_ACCURACY ac tivates a fully iterative 
plasticity algorithm, which will remedy this.  This  is not to be confused with the MITER 
ﬂag on *CONTROL_SHELL, which governs the treatment of the plane stress 
assumption for shell elements.  If any failure mode l is applied with this option, incident 
failure will initiate damage, and the stress will c ontinuously degrade to zero before 
erosion for a deformation of 1 %  plastic strain.  For instance, if the failure stra in is 
FAIL = 0.05 , then the element is eroded when |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.06  and the material goes from 
intact to completely damaged between |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.05  and |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.06 . The reason is to enhance 
implicit performance by maintaining continuity in t he internal forces. *. 24

and PT, a weighted average of the two load curves i s used.  Both 
PC and PT should be entered as positive values.

PCUTC Pressure cut- oﬀ in compression (PCUTC must be greater than or 
equal to zero).  PCUTC (and PCUTT) apply only to el ement types 
that use a 3D stress update, such as solids, tshell  formulatio ns 3 
and 5, and SPH.  When the pressure cut- oﬀ is reached the 
deviatoric stress tensor is set to zero and the pre ssure remains at 
its compressive value.  Like the yield stress, PCUT C is scaled to 
account for rate eﬀects. 
PCUTT Pressure cut-oﬀ in tensio n (PCUTT must be less than or equal to 
zero).  When the pressure cut- oﬀ is reached, the deviatoric stress

HLCID Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_CURVE) g iving true strain as a 
function true stress.  This curve is used in conjun ction with OPT 
below and should not be referenced or used in other  keywords. 
Using this parameter is not recommended.  
OPT Error calculation ﬂag.   The default value of “0” is recommended.  
EQ.2:  LS-DYNA will perform error calculation based on the 
true stress- strain curve from uniaxial tension, speciﬁed 
by HLCID.  The corrections will be made to the cycl ic 
load curve, both in the loading and unloading porti ons.  
Since, in some c ases where loading is more complex, the 
accumulated plastic strain could be large (say more  than 
30%), the input uniaxial stress- strain curve must have 
enough strain range to cover the maximum expected 
plastic strain.  Note this variable must be set to a v alue of 
“2” if HLCID is speciﬁed and a stress- strain curve is 
used.

The Yoshida & Uemori Kinematic Hardening Model: 
The two-surface model from Yoshida and Uemori is in dicated by the following 
equations where the variable descriptions are indic ated in Figure M125-1  [2]: 
|u1D6F+∗= |u1D6F+ − |u1D6FD
|u1D6F+∗=/u1D450|<racketleftCv6|parenleftCv4|u1D44∆
/u1D44C|parenriµhtCv4 (|u1D7≠∆ − |u1D6F+) −/radical.v5|u1D44∆
|u1D6F+∗|u1D6F+∗|<racketriµhtCv6 |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst
|u1D44∆ = |u1D43J + |u1D44J −/u1D44C 
The anisotropic hardening parameter, |u1D44J̇, depends on the value of IOPT.  The original 
Yoshida and Uemori model includes saturation in str ain hardening (IOPT = 0) [ 1, 2] and 
was modiﬁed to include continuous hardening (IOPT =  1).  The change in the parameter 
is as follows: 
|u1D44J̇=/u1D458(|u1D44Jsat − |u1D44J)|u1D7≠≠̅̇|u1D4JDCst           if IOPT = 0

The change of size and location for the bounding su rface is deﬁned as follows, with

for the lowest v alue of strain rate deﬁned by the curve is used if 
the strain rate is zero.  The scale factor for the highest value of 
strain rate deﬁned by the curve also deﬁnes the upp er limit of the *. 26

The relative volume, |u1D449, is deﬁned as the ratio of the current volume over  the 
initial volume, and typically, |u1D449 = 1  at the beginning of a calculation.  
For corotational solid elements, types 0 and 9, the  components of the stress 
tensor remain uncoupled and the uncompressed elasti c moduli are used, that 
is, the fully compacted elastic moduli are ignored.  
3.  Stress Update for Uncompacted Material.   The load curves deﬁne the 
magnitude of the stress as the material undergoes d eformation.  The ﬁrst value 
in the curve should be less than or equal to zero c orresponding to tension and 
increase to full compaction.  Care should be taken when deﬁning the curves so the  
extrapolated values do not lead to negative yield s tresses.  
At the beginning of the stress update we transform each element’s stresses and 
strain rates into the local element coordinate syst em.  After completing the 
stress update we transform the stresses back to the  global conﬁguration.  For 
the uncompacted material, the trial stress componen ts are updated using the 
elastic interpolated moduli according to: 0Curve extends into negative strain 
quadrant since LS-DYNA will 
extrapolate using the two end points.
It is important that the extropolation 
does not extend into the negative 
stress region.

Unloading is based on the interpolated Young’s 
moduli which must provide an unloading tangent 
that exceeds the loading tangent. σij

Figure M126-1.  Stress as a function of strain.  Note that the “yield stress” at a 
strain of zero is nonzero.  In the load curve deﬁnition the “ time” value is the 
directional strain and the “function” value is the yield stress.   Note that for 
element types 0 and 9 engineering strains are used, but for all other element 
types the rates are integrated in time. *. 26  
 ial behavior.  We introduce the parameters |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st) and |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st) as the hydro- 
static  and shear  limit stresses , respectively.  These are functions of the volumet ric 
strain and are assumed given by  
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠v ol ) = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠v ol )
|u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠v ol ) = |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠v ol )  , 
where we have reused the densiﬁcation function |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst.  The new parameters are 
the initial hydrostatic and shear limit stress valu es, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st and |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st, and are provid- 
ed by the user as GCAU and |ECC U |, respectively.  The negative sign of ECCU 
ﬂags the third yield surface option whenever LCA < 0.  The eﬀect of the third 
formulation is that (i) for a uniaxial stress the s tress limit is given by 
|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st(/u1D̅1∫, |u1D7≠≠v ol ), (ii) for a pressure the stress limit is given by |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st), and (iii) for a 
simple shear the stress limit is given by |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st).  Experiments have shown 
that the model may give noisy responses and inhomog eneous deformation 
modes if parameters are not chosen with care.  We t herefore recommend to (i) 
avoid large slopes in the function |u1D7≠∆|u1D443Cst, (ii) let the functions |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst and |u1D7≠∆|u1D464Cst be slightly 
increasing, and (iii) avoid large diﬀerences betwee n the stress limit values 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst(/u1Dℜ11, |u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st), |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st) and |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st). These guidelines are likely to contradict how 
one would interpret test data and it is up to the u ser to ﬁnd a reasonable trade-
oﬀ between matching experimental results and avoidi ng the mentioned nu- 
merical side eﬀects. 
4.  Stress Update for Fully Compacted Material.   As in the uncompacted case, 
we transform each element’s stresses and strain rat es into the local element 
coordinate system.  For fully compacted material (e lement formulations 1 and 
2), we assume that the material behavior is elastic -perfectly plastic and updat- 
ed the stress components according to: 
|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst trial = |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+ 2|u1D43A∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D451.st |u1D4J2Cst|u1D463Cst/u1D45B.sts+|oneCsts|twoCsts/fraction.v2
 
where the deviatoric strain increment is deﬁned as 
∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D451.st |u1D4J2Cst|u1D463Cst = ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst −1
3∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
We now check to see if the yield stress for the ful ly compacted material is ex- 
ceeded by comparing

nents to the yield surface

measures.  This stress is added to the stress tenso r determined from the strain energy 
functional. 
 
If we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, the relaxation function is represented by 
up to six terms from the Prony series:

|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a dampers and springs in 
series.  We characterize this in the input by shear  moduli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and decay constants, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.  
The viscoelastic behavior is optional and an arbitr ary number of terms may be used. *. 28

from the Prony series:

|u1D4JACst=|oneCst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst .

An arbitrary number of terms, up to 6, may be used when applying the viscoelastic

included to model a non- zero and linear/exponential isotropic 
work hardening rate at large values of eﬀective pla stic strain.  If 
the isotropic work hardening rate predicted by the utilized Voce-
type work hardening rule falls below the speciﬁed value it is 
substituted by the prescribed value or switched to a power- law 
hardening if S100 ≠ 0.  This option should be considered for 
problems involving extensive plastic deformations.  If process 
dependent material characteristics are prescribed, that is, if LC > 0 
the same minimum tangent modulus is assumed for all  the 
prescribed work hardening curves.  If instead EMIN < 0 then –
EMIN deﬁnes the plastic strain value at which the l inear or 
power-law hardening approximation commences.

Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   A way to invoke logarithmic 
interpolation between discrete strain rates is desc ribed as follows.  
If the ﬁrst  value in the table is negative, LS-DY NA assumes that 
all the table values represent the natural logarith m of a strain rate.  
There is some addit ional computational cost associated with 
invoking logarithmic interpolation.

Remarks: 
1.  Ultimate Displacements.  The ultimate displacements in the normal and 
tangential directions are the displacements at the time when the material has 
failed completely, that is, the tractions are zero.   The linear stiﬀness for loading 
followed by the linear softening during the damage provides an especially 
simple relationship among the energy release rates,  peak tractions, and ulti- 
mate displacements: 
GIC = |u1D447 ×U ND

GIIC = |u1D446 ×U TD 
2 *. 38  
 A reasonable choice for the exponent |u1D6F∆ would be GAMMA = 1.0 (default) or 
GAMMA = 2.0. 
3.  Interface Damage.   In this model, damage of the interface is conside red, that 
is, irreversible conditions are enforced with loadi ng/unloading paths coming 
from/pointing to the origin. 
4.  Peak Tractions as Load Curves.   Peak tractions |u1D447 and/or |u1D446 can be deﬁned as 
functions of characteristic element length (square root of mid-surface area) 
using a load curve.  This option helps obtain the s ame global responses (e.g. 
load-displacement curve) with coarse meshes when co mpared to a ﬁne mesh 
solution.  In general, lower peak traction values a re needed for coarser meshes.  
5.  Error Checks of Material Data.   Two error checks have been implemented for 
this material model in order to ensure proper mater ial data.  Since the traction 
as a function of displacement curve is fairly simpl e (triangular shaped), equa- 
tions can be developed to ensure that the displacem ent, /u1D4:F, at the peak load 
(QMAX), is smaller than the ultimate distance for f ailure, |u1D462.  See Figure M138-2  
for the used notation.

 Remarks: 
1.  Load Curves.   This material model is available for the Belytsch ko resultant 
beam element only.  Plastic hinges form at the ends  of the beam when the mo- 
ment reaches the plastic moment.  The plastic momen t as a function of rotation 
relationship is speciﬁed by the user in the form of  a load curve and scale factor.  
The points of the load curve are (plastic rotation in radians, plastic moment).  
Both quantities should be positive for all points, with the ﬁrst point being (ze- 
ro, initial plastic moment).  Within this constrain t any form of characteristic 
may be used, including ﬂat or falling curves.  Diﬀe rent load curves and scale 
factors may be speciﬁed at each node and about each  of the local |u1D46≠ and |u1D461 axes. 
Axial collapse occurs when the compressive axial lo ad reaches the collapse 
load.  Collapse load as a function of collapse deﬂe ction is speciﬁed in the form 
of a load curve.  The points of the load curve are either 
|parenleftCv1true strain, collapse force|parenriµhtCv1  or |parenleftCv1change in length, collapse force|parenriµhtCv1 .  Both quanti- 
ties should be entered as positive for all points a nd will be interpreted as com- 
pressive.  The ﬁrst point should be |parenleftCv1zero, initial collapse load|parenriµhtCv1 . 
The collapse load may vary with end moment as well as with deﬂections.  In 
this case several load-deﬂection curves are deﬁned,  each corresponding to a 
diﬀerent end moment.  Each load curve should have t he same number of 
points and the same deﬂection values.  The end mome nt is deﬁned as the aver- 
age of the absolute moments at each end of the beam  and is always positive. 
2.  Damping.   Stiﬀness-proportional damping may be added using the damping 
factor |u1D7≠6.  This is deﬁned as follows: 
|u1D7≠6 =2 ×/u1D̅0∫
|u1D714 
where /u1D̅0∫ is the damping factor at the reference frequency |u1D714 (in radians per sec- 
ond).  For example, if 1% damping at 2Hz is require d 
|u1D7≠6 =2 × 0.01 
2/u1D̅0B× 2= 0.0015 92 
If damping is used, a small time step may be requir ed.  LS-DYNA does not 
check this so to avoid instability it may be necess ary to control the time step 
using a load curve.  As a guide, the time step requ ired for any given element is 
multiplied by 0.3/u1D4:F/u1D450|u1D7≠6 ⁄ when damping is present ( /u1D4:F = element length, /u1D450 = sound 
speed). 
3.  Moment Interaction.   Plastic hinges can form due to the combined actio n of 
moments about the three axes.  This facility is act ivated only when yield mo- 
ments are deﬁned in the material input.  A hinge fo rms when the following 
condition is ﬁrst satisﬁed. *. 39  
 On forming a hinge, upper limit moments are set.  T hese are given by  
|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstupper = max 
⎝⎜⎛|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst,|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstyield 
2⎠⎟⎞ 
with similar conditions holding for |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D462Csts|u1D4JDCsts|u1D4JDCsts|u1D4J2Csts /u1D45F.stsand |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst|u1D462Csts|u1D4JDCsts|u1D4JDCsts|u1D4J2Csts /u1D45F.sts.  Thereafter the plastic 
moments will be given by 
|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JDCst= min(|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstupper , |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstcur v e )  , 
where |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JDCsts is the current plastic moment and |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstcur v e  is the moment from the 
load curve at the current rotation scaled by the sc ale factor.  |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D4JDCstand |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst|u1D4JDCst satisfy 
similar conditions.  |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D4JDCstand |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst|u1D4JDCst satisfy similar conditions. 
This provides an upper limit to the moment that can  be generated; it represents 
the softening eﬀect of local buckling at a hinge si te.  Thus, if a member is bent 
about the local |u1D46≠-axis, it will then be weaker in torsion and about its local |u1D461-axis.  
For moments-softening curves, the eﬀect is to trim oﬀ the initial peak (although 
if the curves subsequently harden, the ﬁnal hardeni ng will also be trimmed 
oﬀ). 
It is not possible to make the plastic moment vary with the current axial load, 
but it is possible to make hinge formation a functi on of axial load and subse- 
quent plastic moment a function of the moment at th e time the hinge formed.  
This is discussed in Remark 4 . 
4.  Independent Plastic Hinge Formation.   In addition to the moment interac- 
tion equation, Cards 7 through 18 allow plastic hin ges to form independently 
for the |u1D46≠-axis and |u1D461-axis at each end of the beam as well as for the to rsional axis.  
A plastic hinge is assumed to form if any component  of the current moment 
exceeds the yield moment as deﬁned by the yield mom ent as a function axial 
force curves input on cards 7 and 8.  If any of the  5 curves is omitted, a hinge 
will not form for that component.  The curves can b e deﬁned for both compres- 
sive and tensile axial forces.  If the axial force falls outside the range of the 
curve, the ﬁrst or last point in the curve will be used.  A hinge forming for one 
component of moment does not aﬀect the other compon ents. 
Upon forming a hinge, the magnitude of that compone nt of moment will not 
be permitted to exceed the current plastic moment.  The current plastic mo- 
ment is obtained by interpolating between the plast ic moment as a function of 
plastic rotation curves input on cards 10, 12, 14, 16, or 18.  Curves may be input 
for up to 8 hinge moments, where the hinge moment i s deﬁned as the yield 
moment at the time that the hinge formed.  Curves m ust be input in order of 
increasing hinge moment and each curve should have the same plastic rotation 
values.  The ﬁrst or last curve will be used if the  hinge moment falls outside the 
range of the curves.  If no curves are deﬁned, the plastic moment is obtained *. 40

Model Description: 
This model is based on the work of Lemaitre [1992],  and Dufailly and Lemaitre [1995].  
It is a pressure-independent plasticity model with the yield surface deﬁned by the 
function 
|u1D439 = |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt− |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= 0  , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst is uniaxial yield stress, 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCst+/u1D4:B
|u1D6FD|<racketleftCv11 − exp|parenleftCv1−|u1D6FD|u1D4JF|parenriµhtCv1|<racketriµhtCv1  . 
By setting |u1D6FD = 0 , a linear isotropic hardening is obtained 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCst+/u1D4:B |u1D4JF  , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCst is the initial yield stress.  In the above, |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt is the equivalent von Mises stress, 
with respect to the deviatoric eﬀective stress, 
s|eCst= de v [σ/tilℂecomb.h1] −α=s−α   .  
Here /u1D42C is deviatoric stress and /u1D6C2 is the back stress, which is the sum of up to four  terms 
according to: 
α=|summationCv1α/∗.st
/∗.st  . 
σ/tilℂecomb.h1 is eﬀective stress (undamaged stress), based on Co ntinuum Damage Mechanics 
model [Lemaitre 1992], 
σ/tilℂecomb.h1=σ
1 − |u1D437  . 
Here |u1D437 is the isotropic damage scalar, which is bounded b y 0 and 1 
0 ≤ |u1D437 ≤ 1  . 
|u1D437 = 0  represents a damage-free material RVE (representat ive volume element), while 
|u1D437 = 1  represents a fully broken material RVE in two part s.  In fact, fracture occurs when 
|u1D437 = |u1D437|u1D4J≠Cst< 1, modeled as element removal.  The evolution of the  isotropic damage value 
related to ductile damage and fracture (the case wh ere the plastic strain or dissipation is 
much larger than the elastic one, [Lemaitre 1992]) is deﬁned as

 Uniaxial cyclic tension and compression: 
This material can be used to model cyclic hardening  plasticity, including eﬀects known 
as plastic shakedown  and strain racheting . To understand how the plasticity parameters 
qualitatively inﬂuence the behavior in uniaxial ten sion and compression, we restrict 
ourselves to a discussion concerning linear isotrop ic hardening with initial yield |u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st and 
hardening modulus /u1D4:B. We also only include two kinematic hardening term s.  For the 
kinematic part, we use one linear term with hardeni ng |u1D436|zeroCst (and decay coeﬃcient |u1D6F∆|zeroCst= 0)  
and one combined term with hardening |u1D436 and decay coeﬃcient |u1D6F∆. The elastic Young’s 
modulus is denoted |u1D438, and we neglect any forms of temperature or rate e ﬀects. 
 
While this is merely an attempt to explain the phen omena, estimating the parameters 
that reﬂect the actual behavior of the physical mat erial may be diﬃcult.  Because of this, 
we recommend the ﬁtting options provided by KHFLG, where even the eﬀects of 
temperature can be accounted for. 
 
Strain induced deformation 
 
Consider the cyclic deformation depicted in Figure M153-1  in which the uniaxial strain 
ranges between |u1D7≠≠ and |u1D7≠≠̅. Two subsequent stress-strain cycles are shown.  
 
If the isotropic hardening modulus  /u1D4:B= 0, then the cycles are identical.  For nonzero 
hardening /u1D4:B, the stress level increases with each cycle and th e strain width indicated by 
|u1D7≠≠⃡ decreases.  As the yield surface expands, the isot ropic hardening eﬀect diminishes, 
and we tend towards a stable cycle; this phenomenon  is called plastic shakedown . 
 
If both /u1D4:B and |u1D436|zeroCst are zero, then the end of each cycle tends towards  ideal plastic since 
the presence of a nonzero |u1D6F∆ saturates the level of back stress and consequentl y the stress 
|u1D7≠∆ itself.  This physical phenomenon is unlikely.  Th erefore, we recommend having at 
least one linear kinematic hardening term present i n combination with some isotropic 
hardening for a realistic behavior. 
 
Stress induced deformation 
 
For stress induced deformation, we impose a cyclic stress between |u1D7≠∆ and |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt as shown in 
Figure M153-2  and investigate two subsequent stress-strain cycle s.  In this case a 
combination of isotropic hardening and nonlinear ki nematic hardening may cause a 
drift in strain.  This drift is referred to as ratcheting strain  and may be considered a creep 
phenomenon.  Even without the isotropic hardening /u1D4:B, a nonzero mean stress, 
(|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt+ |u1D7≠∆)/2, in the cycle causes a ratcheting eﬀect.  We again  recommend using 
combinations of isotropic, linear and nonlinear kin ematic hardening for accurate 
predictions of this creep behavior.

Remarks: 
The eﬀective yield stress as a function of eﬀective  plastic strain behavior follows a 
diﬀerent curve in compression than it does in tensi on.  Tension is determined by the 
sign of the mean stress where a positive mean stres s (meaning a negative pressure) is 
indicative of tension.  Two curves must be deﬁned g iving the yield stress as a function 
of eﬀective plastic strain.  One curve is for the t ensile regime and the other curve is for 
the compressive regime. 
 
Mean stress is an invariant which can be expressed as |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D467Cst|parenriµhtCv2 3 ⁄. PC and PT 
deﬁne a range of mean stress values within which in terpolation is done between the 
tensile yield surface and compressive yield surface .  PC and PT are not true material 
properties but are just a numerical convenience so that the transition from one yield 
surface to the other is not as abrupt as the sign o f the mean stress changes.  Both PC, PT, 
PCUTC, and PCUTT may all be input as positive value s.  It is implied that PC and 
PCUTC are compressive values and that PT and PCUTT are tensile values.  The 
algebraic sign given these variables by the user is  inconsequential. 
 
Strain rate may be accounted for by using either tw o curves of yield stress scaling factor 
as a function of strain rate or a Cowper and Symond s model.  The two curves in the 
former approach are used directly, that is, the cur ves are not rediscretized before being 
used by the material model.   The Cowper and Symond s model scales the yield stress 
with the factor:

Remarks: 
1.  Description of IHIS (Solid Elements).   Several of this material’s parameters 
may be overwritten on an element-by-element basis t hrough history variables 
using the *INITIAL_STRESS_SOLID keyword.  Bitwise ( binary) expansion of 
IHIS determines which material properties are to be  read: 
I H IS = |u1D44∆|fourCst× 16 + |u1D44∆|threeCst×8+ |u1D44∆|twoCst× 4 + |u1D44∆|oneCst× 2 + |u1D44∆|zeroCst, 
where each |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary ﬂag set to either 1 or 0.  The |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst are interpreted accord- 
ing to the following table. 
 
Flag Description Variables # 
|u1D44∆|zeroCst Material directions /u1D45E|oneCst|oneCst , /u1D45E|oneCst|twoCst , /u1D45E|oneCst|threeCst , /u1D45E|threeCst|oneCst , /u1D45E|threeCst|twoCst , /u1D45E|threeCst|threeCst  6

|u1D44∆|fourCst Strength limits XT, XC, YT, YC, ZT, ZC, SXY, SYZ, SZX 9 
The NHISV ﬁeld on *INITIAL_STRESS_SOLID must be set  equal to the sum of 
the number of variables to be read in, which depend s on IHIS (and the |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst): 
N H IS V = 6|u1D44∆|zeroCst+ 21|u1D44∆|oneCst+ 6|u1D44∆|twoCst+ |u1D44∆|threeCst+9|u1D44∆|fourCst. 
Then, in the following order, *INITIAL_STRESS_SOLID  processes the history 
variables, HISV i, as: 
a)  6 material direction parameters when |u1D44∆|zeroCst= 1 
b)  21 anisotropic stiﬀness parameters when |u1D44∆|oneCst= 1 *. 57  
 The /u1D45E|u1D4J6Cst terms are the material direction cosine and sine f or the rotation from a 
co-rotational element’s system to the |u1D44∆-|u1D44F-/u1D450 material directions.  The /u1D450|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  terms are 
the upper triangular terms of the symmetric stiﬀnes s matrix, /u1D450|oneCst|oneCst , /u1D450|oneCst|twoCst , /u1D450|oneCst|threeCst , /u1D450|oneCst|fourCst ,

for the 3-dimensional case (solid elements) with th ree planes of symmetry with 
respect to the material coordinate system.  The int eraction terms |u1D439|oneCst|twoCst , |u1D439|twoCst|threeCst , and 
|u1D439|threeCst|oneCst  are given by

If these conditions are violated, then the stress t ensor will be reduced to zero 
over NCFAIL time steps and then the element gets er oded.  A small value for 
NCFAIL (< 50) is recommended to avoid unphysical be havior; the default is 
10. The default values for the strengths XT, XC, YT , YC, ZT, ZC, SXY, SYZ, and 
SZX are 10 20 , that is, basically no limits.  The scale factors FF12, FF23, and FF31 
for the interaction terms are zero by default.  
4.  Tsai-Hill failure criterion (EXTRA = 2).   Brittle failure with diﬀerent strengths 
in tension and compression in all main material dir ections can be invoked with 
EXTRA = 2 and the deﬁnition of corresponding parame ters on Cards 8 and 9 *. 57  
 Converting Moldﬂow Results into LS-Dyna Keyword For mat: 
Starting in LS-PrePost 4.6, a feature has been adde d to map Moldﬂow results for short 
ﬁber reinforced composite injection molding to the LS-DYNA keyword format.  This 
feature reads in the results from Moldﬂow, maps the  results to the LS-DYNA mesh, and 
calculates the anisotropic elasticity tensor /u1D450|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  for structure analysis using this keyword 
with *INITIAL_STRESS_SHELL keyword card.  This feat ure can only be used with shell 
LS-DYNA elements.   
 
To convert the Moldﬂow results, the udm  format of the Moldﬂow solid mesh and the 
xml  format of the ﬁber orientation result from the mol ding simulation are required.  
These ﬁles are mapped onto the LS-DYNA shell mesh. 
 
LS-PrePost obtains the spatially varying /u1D450|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  for this keyword using a two-step process.  
First, the elastic properties of the homogenized un idirectional ﬁber reinforced 
composite are calculated from the Young’s modulus a nd the Poisson ratio of the ﬁber 
 Figure M157-1.   Moldﬂow conversion dialog box. *. 57  
 8.  The Pick Parts  section is used to select which parts of the Moldﬂ ow mesh is 
being mapped to the LS-Dyna parts.  When selecting the From , select the ap- 
propriate Moldﬂow part.  For the To , select the appropriate LS-DYNA part. 
9.  The Pick Segments  provides an orientation for the mapping onto the L S-DYNA 
part.  Just select two diﬀerent sides for Side1  and Side2  of the LS-DYNA part. 
10.  Then select Map  to make the conversion based on the above inputs. 
11.  After mapping.  the results can be output using th e Save *INITIAL to  section 
which saves the results so that they can be used fo r LS-DYNA calculations.

Remarks: 
1.  Model Overview.   This is a cap model with a smooth intersection be tween the 
shear yield surface and hardening cap, as shown in Figure M159-1 .  The initial 
damage surface coincides with the yield surface.  R ate eﬀects are modeled with 
viscoplasticity.  For a complete theoretical descri ption, with references and 
example problems see [Murray 2007] and [Murray, Abu -Odeh and Bligh 2007]. 
2.  Stress Invariants.   The yield surface is formulated in terms of three  stress 
invariants: /u1D4:D|oneCst which is the ﬁrst invariant of the stress tensor, /u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst which is the 
second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, a nd /u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst which is the third invar- 
iant of the deviatoric stress tensor.  The invarian ts are deﬁned in terms of the 
deviatoric stress tensor,  |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , and pressure, |u1D443, as follows: *. 59  
 5.  Rubin Scaling Function.   Concrete fails at lower values of /radical.v23/u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst (principal 
stress diﬀerence) for triaxial extension (TXE) and torsion (TOR) tests than it 
does for TXC tests conducted at the same pressure.  The Rubin scaling func- 
tion, ℜ, determines the strength of concrete for any state  of stress relative to the 
strength for TXC, using ℜ|u1D439/f.st.  Strength in torsion is modeled as |u1D444|oneCst|u1D439/f.st.  Strength 
in TXE is modeled as |u1D444|twoCst|u1D439/f.st, where:  
|u1D444|oneCst= |u1D6F+|oneCst− |u1D7≠6|oneCstexp|parenleftCv1−|u1D6FD|oneCst/u1D4:D|oneCst|parenriµhtCv1 +/u1D̅0:|oneCst/u1D4:D|oneCst
|u1D444|twoCst= |u1D6F+|twoCst− |u1D7≠6|twoCstexp|parenleftCv1−|u1D6FD|twoCst/u1D4:D|oneCst|parenriµhtCv1 +/u1D̅0:|twoCst/u1D4:D|oneCst 
6.  Cap Hardening Surface.   The strength of concrete is modeled by a combina-
tion of the cap and shear surfaces in the low to hi gh conﬁning pressure re- 
gimes.  The cap is used to model plastic volume cha nge related to pore collapse 
(although the pores are not explicitly modeled).  T he isotropic hardening cap is 
a two-part function that is either unity or an elli pse: 
|u1D439|u1D4J≠Cst( /u1D4:D|oneCst,/u1D̅05 ) = 1 −[/u1D4:D|oneCst−/u1D4:F (/u1D̅05)][ |/u1D4:D|oneCst−/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05)| +/u1D4:D|oneCst−/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) ]

where /u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) is deﬁned as:

The equation for |u1D439|u1D4J≠Cst is equal to unity for /u1D4:D|oneCst≤/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05).  It describes the ellipse for 
/u1D4:D|oneCst>/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05). The intersection of the shear surface and the cap  is at /u1D4:D|oneCst=/u1D̅05.  /u1D̅05|zeroCst is the 
value of /u1D4:D|oneCst at the initial  intersection of the cap and shear surfaces before hard- 
ening is engaged (before the cap moves).  The equat ion for /u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) restrains the 
cap from retracting past its initial location at /u1D̅05|zeroCst. 
The intersection of the cap with the /u1D4:D|oneCst axis is at /u1D4:D|oneCst=/u1D44B(/u1D̅05).  This intersection 
depends upon the cap ellipticity ratio |u1D44J, where |u1D44J is the ratio of its major to 
minor axes: 
/u1D44B(/u1D̅05) =/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) + |u1D44J|u1D439/u1D45:.st[/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05)] . 
The cap moves to simulate plastic volume change.  T he cap expands ( /u1D44B(/u1D̅05) and 
/u1D̅05 increase) to simulate plastic volume compaction.  The cap contracts ( /u1D44B(/u1D̅05) 
and /u1D̅05 decrease) to simulate plastic volume expansion, ca lled dilation.   The 
motion (expansion and contraction) of the cap is ba sed upon the hardening

Here |u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst|u1D4JDCst is the plastic volume strain, /u1D44A is the maximum plastic volume strain,

The damage parameter that is applied to the six str esses is equal to the current 
maximum of the brittle or ductile damage parameter.   The parameters |u1D434 and |u1D43J 
or |u1D436 and |u1D437 set the shape of the softening curve plotted as st ress-displacement 
or stress-strain.   The parameter |u1D4J1max  is the maximum damage level that can be 
attained.  It is internally calculated and is less than one at moderate conﬁning 
pressures.  See [Murray 2007] for a description of how |u1D4J1max  is calculated for 
diﬀerent loading regimes.  The compressive softenin g parameter, |u1D434, may also 
be reduced with conﬁnement, using the input ﬁeld PM OD, as follows: 
|u1D434 = |u1D434(|u1D4J1max + 0.001)PMOD  
9.  Regulating Mesh Size Sensitivity.   The concrete model maintains constant 
fracture energy, regardless of element size.  The f racture energy is deﬁned here 
as the area under the stress-displacement curve fro m peak strength to zero 
strength.  This is done by internally formulating t he softening parameters |u1D434 
and |u1D436 (see Remark 8 ) in terms of the element length,  /u1D45∫ (cube root of the element 
volume), the fracture energy, |u1D43A/f.st, the initial damage threshold, /u1D̅0F|zeroCst|u1D461Cst or /u1D̅0F|zeroCst|u1D4J≠Cst, and 
the softening shape parameters, |u1D437 or |u1D43J. 
The fracture energy is calculated from up to ﬁve us er-speciﬁed input ﬁelds: 
GFC, GFS, GFT, PWRC, and PWRT.  The user speciﬁes t hree distinct fracture 
energy values.  These are the fracture energy in un iaxial tensile stress, GFT; 
pure shear stress, GFS; and uniaxial compressive st ress, GFC.  The model in- 
ternally selects the fracture energy from equations  which interpolate between 
the three fracture energy values as a function of t he stress state (expressed us- 
ing two stress invariants).  The interpolation equa tions depend upon the user-
speciﬁed input powers PWRC and PWRT, as follows:

Material Models: 
The unidirectional and fabric layer failure criteri a and the associated property 
degradation models for material 161 are described a s follows.  All the failure criteria are 
expressed in terms of stress components based on pl y level stresses 
(|u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst,/u1D̅0F|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst ,/u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst ,/u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst ) and the associated elastic moduli are (|u1D438|u1D44∆Cst, |u1D438|u1D44FCst, |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst, |u1D43A|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst , |u1D43A|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst , |u1D43A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst ).  
Note that for the unidirectional model, |u1D44∆, |u1D44F and /u1D450 denote the ﬁber, in-plane transverse *. 61-162  
 |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst = |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst (|zeroCst)+ tan(/u1Dℜ11)⟨−|u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst⟩

where ϕ is a material constant as tan(/u1Dℜ11) is similar to the coeﬃcient of friction, and |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst (|zeroCst), 
|u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst (|zeroCst)and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst)are the shear strength values of the corresponding tensile modes. 
 
Failure predicted by the criterion of |u1D4J3|fourCst can be referred to as transverse matrix failure, 
while the matrix failure predicted by |u1D4J3|fiveCst, which is parallel to the layer, can be referred a s 
the delamination mode when it occurs within the ele ments that are adjacent to the ply 
interface.  Note that a scale factor |u1D446 is introduced to provide better correlation of 
delamination area with experiments.  The scale fact or |u1D446 can be determined by ﬁtting the 
analytical prediction to experimental data for the delamination area. 
 
When ﬁber failure in tension/shear mode is predicte d in a layer by |u1D4J3|oneCst, the load carrying 
capacity of that layer is completely eliminated.  A ll the stress components are reduced 
to zero instantaneously (100 time steps to avoid nu merical instability).  For compressive 
ﬁber failure, the layer is assumed to carry a resid ual axial load, while the transverse 
load carrying capacity is reduced to zero.  When th e ﬁber compressive failure mode is 
reached due to |u1D4J3|twoCst, the axial layer compressive strength stress is as sumed to reduce to a 
residual value |u1D446|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  (= SFFC × |u1D446|u1D434Cst /u1D4:6.st ).  The axial stress is then assumed to remain cons tant, 
meaning |u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst =  −|u1D446|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st , for continuous compressive loading, while the sub sequent 
unloading curve follows a reduced axial modulus to zero axial stress and strain state.  
When the ﬁber crush failure occurs, the material is  assumed to behave elastically for 
compressive pressure, |u1D4JD > 0 , and to carry no load for tensile pressure, |u1D4JD < 0 . 
 
When a matrix failure (delamination) in the |u1D44∆|u1D44F -plane is predicted, the strength values 
for |u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst (|zeroCst)and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst) are set to zero.  This results in reducing the str ess components |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst, /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  
and /u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst  to the fractured material strength surface.  For te nsile mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst> 0, these stress 
components are reduced to zero.  For compressive mo de, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst< 0, the normal stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst is 
assumed to deform elastically for the closed matrix  crack.  Loading on the failure 
envelop, the shear stresses are assumed to ‘slide’ on the fractured strength surface 
(frictional shear stresses) like in an ideal plasti c material, while the subsequent 
unloading shear stress-strain path follows reduced shear moduli to the zero shear stress 
and strain state for both /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  and /u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst  components. 
 
The post failure behavior for the matrix crack in t he a-c plane due to |u1D4J3|fourCst is modeled in the 
same fashion as that in the |u1D44∆|u1D44F -plane as described above.  In this case, when fail ure 
occurs, |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst (|zeroCst) and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst)are reduced to zero instantaneously.  The post frac ture response is 
then governed by failure criterion of |u1D4J3|fiveCst with |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst (|zeroCst)= 0 and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst)= 0.  For tensile mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst>
0, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst, /u1D̅0F|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst  and /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  are zero.  For compressive mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst< 0, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst is assumed to be elastic, 
while /u1D̅0F|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst  and /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  ‘slide’ on the fracture strength surface as in an ideal plastic material, *. 61-162  
 Another failure mode, which is due to the quadratic  interaction between the thickness 
stresses, is expected to be mainly a matrix failure .  This through the thickness matrix 
failure criterion is

strengths assumed to depend on the compressive norm al stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst, meaning

When failure predicted by this criterion occurs wit hin elements that are adjacent to the 
ply interface, the failure plane is expected to be parallel to the layering planes, and, 
thus, can be referred to as the delamination mode.  Note that a scale factor |u1D446 is 
introduced to provide better correlation of delamin ation area with experiments.  The 
scale factor |u1D446 can be determined by ﬁtting the analytical predict ion to experimental data 
for the delamination area. 
 
Similar to the unidirectional model, when ﬁber tens ile/shear failure is predicted in a 
layer by |u1D4J3|sixCst or |u1D4J3|sevenCst, the load carrying capacity of that layer in the a ssociated direction is 
completely eliminated.  For compressive ﬁber failur e due to by |u1D4J3/eight.st or |u1D4J3/nine.st, the layer is 
assumed to carry a residual axial load in the faile d direction, while the load carrying 
capacity transverse to the failed direction is assu med unchanged.  When the 
compressive axial stress in a layer reaches the com pressive axial strength |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst /u1D4:6.st  or |u1D446|u1D44FCst /u1D4:6.st , the 
axial layer stress is assumed to be reduced to the residual strength |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  or |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  where 
|u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  =  SFFC × |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst /u1D4:6.st  and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  =  SFFC × |u1D446|u1D44FCst /u1D4:6.st .  The axial stress is assumed to remain 
constant, that is, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst =  −|u1D446|u1D44∆Cst /u1D4:6.st |u1D44JCst  or |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst =  −|u1D446|u1D44FCst /u1D4:6.st |u1D44JCst , for continuous compressive loading, 
while the subsequent unloading curve follows a redu ced axial modulus.  When the ﬁber 
crush failure is occurred, the material is assumed to behave elastically for compressive 
pressure, |u1D4JD > 0 , and to carry no load for tensile pressure,  |u1D4JD < 0 . 
 
When the in-plane matrix shear failure is predicted  by |u1D4J3|oneCst|oneCst  the axial load carrying 
capacity within a failed element is assumed unchang ed, while the in-plane shear stress 
is assumed to be reduced to zero. 
 
For through the thickness matrix (delamination) fai lure given by equation |u1D4J3|oneCst|twoCst , the in-
plane load carrying capacity within the element is assumed to be elastic, while the 
strength values for the tensile mode, |u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst (|zeroCst) and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst), are set to zero.  For tensile mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst>
0, the through the thickness stress components are r educed to zero.  For compressive 
mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst< 0, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst is assumed to be elastic, while /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  and /u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst  ‘slide’ on the fracture 
strength surface as in an ideal plastic material, a nd the unloading path follows reduced 
shear moduli to the zero shear stress and strain st ate.

Element Erosion: 
A failed element is eroded in any of three diﬀerent  ways: 
1.  If ﬁber tensile failure in a unidirectional layer is predicted in the element and 
the axial tensile strain is greater than E_LIMT.  F or a fabric layer, both in-plane 
directions are failed and exceed E_LIMT. 
2.  If compressive relative volume in a failed element  is smaller than ECRSH. 
3.  If tensile relative volume in a failed element is greater than EEXPN.

 Remarks: 
The polymer is assumed to have two basic resistance s to deformation: 
1.  An intermolecular barrier to deformation related t o relative movement 
between molecules. 
2.  An evolving anisotropic resistance related to stra ightening of the molecule 
chains. 
 
The model which is implemented and presented in thi s paper is mainly based on the 
framework suggested by Boyce et al.  [2000].  Going  back to the original work by 
Haward and Thackray [1968], they considered the uni axial case only.  The extension to 
a full 3D formulation was proposed by Boyce et al.  [1988].  Moreover, Boyce and co-
workers have during a period of 20 years changed or  further developed the parts of the 
original model.  Haward and Thackray [1968] used an  Eyring model to represent the 
dashpot in Fig. M168-1 , while Boyce et al.  [2000] employed the double-ki nk model of 
Argon [1973] instead.  Part B of the model, describ ing the resistance associated with 
straightening of the molecules, contained originall y a one-dimensional Langevin spring 
[Haward and Thackray, 1968], which was generalized to 3D with the eight-chain model 
by Arruda and Boyce [1993]. 
 
The main structure of the model presented by Boyce et al.  [2000] is kept for this model.

 2.  Bond Stiffness and Strength.   In-plane stresses are set to zero: it is assumed 
that the stiﬀness and strength of the substrate is large compared with that of 
the adhesive, given the relative thicknesses. 
If the substrate is modeled with shell elements, it  is expected that these will lie 
at the mid-surface of the substrate geometry.  Ther efore, the solid elements 
representing the adhesive will be thicker than the actual bond.  If the elastic 
compliance of the bond is signiﬁcant, this can be c orrected by increasing the 
elastic stiﬀness property |u1D438. 
3.  Stress and Failure.   The yield and failure surfaces are treated as a p ower-law 
combination of direct tension and shear across the bond: 
|parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆
|u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst|xCst |parenriµhtCvJPWRT 
    + |parenleftCvJ/u1D̅0F
/u1D̅0F|mCst|aCst|xCst − SH T _SL × |u1D7≠∆|parenriµhtCvJPWRS 
    = 1.0 
At yield SHT_SL is the slope of the yield surface a t |u1D7≠∆ = 0 .  See Figure M169-1 . 
The stress-displacement curves for tension and shea r are shown in Figure 
M169-2 . In both cases, GC is the area under the curve.  T he displacement to 
failure in tension is given by 
|u1D4J1ft = 2 |parenleftCvJGCTEN 
TENMAX |parenriµhtCvJ   , 
subject to a lower limit 
|u1D4J1ft, min = |parenleftCvJ2/u1D4:F|zeroCst
|u1D438|minuteCst|parenriµhtCvJ TENMAX  , 
where /u1D4:F|zeroCst is the initial element thickness (or BTHK if used)  and 
|u1D438|minuteCst=|u1D438(1 −/u1D̅08)
(1 − 2/u1D̅08)(1 +/u1D̅08)   . 
If GCTEN is input such that |u1D4J1ft < |u1D4J1ft, min , LS-DYNA will automatically increase 
GCTEN to make |u1D4J1ft = |u1D4J1ft, min .  Therefore, GCTEN has a minimum value of SHT_SL > 0

Remarks: 
The brace element is intended to represent the buck ling, yielding and cyclic behavior of 
steel elements, such as tubes or I-sections, that c arry only axial loads.  A single beam 
element should be used to represent each structural  element.  Empirical relationships 
are used to determine the buckling and cyclic load- deﬂection behavior.  The cyclic 
behavior is shown in Figure M171-1  (compression shown as negative force and 
displacement).   
 
The initial buckling load (point 2) is: 
|u1D439|u1D44FCst/co⋯⋯a.st initial = FB U CK +FB U CK2 
/u1D4:F|twoCst  , 
where FBUCK and FBUCK2 are input parameters, and /u1D4:F is the length of the beam 
element.  If neither FBUCK nor FBUCK2 are deﬁned, t he default is that the initial 
buckling load is  
SIG Y × A, 
where |u1D434 is the cross sectional area.  The buckling curve ( shown dashed) has the form: 
|u1D439(|u1D4J1) =|u1D439b, initial 
/radical.v1|u1D434|u1D6FF + |u1D43J 
where |u1D6FF is |dividesCv1strain yield strain ⁄ |dividesCv1 , and |u1D434 and |u1D43J are internally calculated functions of 
slenderness ratio ( |u1D7≠6) and loading history. *. 71  
 reduction factor is typically in the range 0.6 to 1 .0 (smaller values for more slender 
members).  By default, CCBRF is calculated using SE AOC 1990: 
CCBRF =1
⎝⎜⎜⎜⎛1 +0.5|u1D7≠6
/u1D̅0B/radical.v5|u1D438
0.5|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst⎠⎟⎟⎟⎞ 
When tensile loading is applied after buckling, the  member must ﬁrst be straightened 
before the full tensile yield force can be develope d.  This is represented by a reduced 
unloading stiﬀness (such as segment 14-15) and the tensile reloading curve (segments 8-
9 and 15-16).  Further details can be found in Brun eau, Uang, and Whittaker [1998] and 
Structural Engineers Association of California [197 4, 1990, 1996]. 
 
 
The response of stocky (low  |u1D7≠6) and slender (high  |u1D7≠6) braces are compared in the graph.  
These diﬀerences are achieved by altering the input  value LAMDA (or the section 
properties of the beam) and FBUCK.

2.  Creating Reinforced Concrete Sections.   Reinforced concrete sections for 
shell or beam elements may be created using *PART_C OMPOSITE (for shells) 
or *INTEGRATION_BEAM (for beams) to deﬁne the secti on.  Create one mate- 
rial deﬁnition to represent the concrete using *MAT _CONCRETE_EC2 with 
FRACR = 0.0. Create another material deﬁnition repr esenting the reinforce- 
ment using *. 72  
 bility is required with the structural engineering data and assumptions of Part 
1-1 of the Eurocode. 
A further option for modelling concrete, TYPEC = 6,  is provided for applica- 
tions, such as seismic engineering, in which the di ﬀerent stress-strain behaviors 
of conﬁned versus unconﬁned concrete needs to be ca ptured.  This option uses 
equations by Mander et al and does not relate direc tly to Eurocode 2.  
4.  Local Material Axes.   The local material axes deﬁne the directions of t he 
reinforcement bars.  If the reinforcement direction s are not consistent across 
neighbouring elements, the response may be less sti ﬀ than intended – this is 
equivalent to the bars being bent at the element bo undaries.  Local material 
axes default to the same as the element axes, with the local |u1D46J direction pointing 
from Node 1 to Node 2. The local material axes can be controlled using the 
angle BETA on *ELEMENT_SHELL_BETA or using AOPT and  associated in- 
put parameters in the material deﬁnition.  See mate rial type 2 for a description 
of the diﬀerent AOPT settings.  
Only the reinforcement response depends on the loca l material axes, not the 
concrete response.  Therefore, it is not usually ne cessary to set the local materi- 
al axes for material deﬁnitions that do not have re inforcement (i.e., FRA- 
CRX = 0 and FRACRY = 0).  However, when a reinforce d concrete section is 
deﬁned using *PART_COMPOSITE, and either the shear capacity check is in- 
voked (TYPESC > 0, see Remark 5 ) or CMPFLG is set on *DATABASE_EX-
TENT_BINARY, then it is important for all layers in  the *PART_COMPOSITE 
deﬁnition to have identical material axes.  This ca n be achieved either by using 
the BETA angle on *ELEMENT_SHELL_BETA or by inputti ng identical AOPT 
parameters for all the material deﬁnitions referenc ed by the *PART_COMPOS-
ITE card. 
5.  Through-thickness Shear. In this material model, cracks are initiated only b y 
in-plane stresses caused by axial and bending eﬀect s.  Once a crack has formed, 
the through-thickness shear stress is limited by co nsiderations of aggregate 
interlock or friction on the crack surfaces.  If th e in-plane stresses are insuﬃ- 
cient to cause cracks, the through-thickness shear strength is by default unlim- 
ited.  Thus, failures caused primarily by through-t hickness shear will not be 
predicted.  The Shear Capacity Check option (see TY PESC) allows you to ad- 
dress this limitation.  Two classes of behaviour ar e available (described in a 
and b), together with diﬀerent options for the calculati on of shear capacity 
(described in c and d):  
a)  TYPESC < 10 represents the situation where suﬃcien t shear reinforcement 
will be provided to prevent any through-thickness f ailure.  LS-DYNA 
generates extra history variables, so you can compa re the shear demand to 
shear capacity to assess the requirements for shear  reinforcement (see the *. 72  
 expansion coeﬃcient as a function of temperature (L CALPC, LCALPR).  These 
apply no matter what types TYPEC and TYPER have bee n selected. 
7.  Erosion Criteria.   Elements are deleted from the calculation when al l of their 
integration points have reached the erosion criteri a.  Because this material 
model can represent plain concrete without reinforc ement, pure reinforcement 
without any concrete, or a smeared combination, the  criteria depends on the 
type being modeled (see Remark 1 ).  There are three criteria: 
a)  Concrete Tensile Strain Limit .  The concrete tensile (crack-opening) strain 
limit ERODET has been exceeded. 
b)  Concrete Compressive Strain Limit .  The concrete compressive strain limit 
ERODEC + |u1D7≠≠csp  has been exceeded. |u1D7≠≠csp  is the strain at which the stress-
strain relation falls to zero. 
c)  Reinforcement Strain Limit.   The reinforcement strain limit ERODER + |u1D7≠≠rsp  
has been exceeded.  |u1D7≠≠rsp  is the strain at which the stress-strain relation falls 
to zero.  However, if LCRSU > 0, |u1D7≠≠rsp  is assumed to be 2.0. 
The table below indicates which of the criteria app ly to each of the variations of 
material type.  Note that FRACR = max (FRACX, FRAC Y ) as discussed in Re- 
mark 1 .

 Tensile response 
 
The concrete is assumed to crack in tension when th e maximum in-plane principal 
stress reaches FT. A non-rotating smeared crack app roach is used.  Cracks can open and 
close repeatedly under hysteretic loading.  When a crack is closed, it can carry 
compression according to the normal compressive str ess-strain relationships.  The 
direction of the crack relative to the element coor dinate system is stored when the crack 
ﬁrst forms.  The material can carry compression par allel to the crack even when the 
crack is open.  Further cracks may then form at pre -determined angles to the ﬁrst crack, 
if the tensile stress in that direction reaches FT.  In versions up to R9, the number of 
further cracks is limited to one, at 90 degrees to the ﬁrst crack.  In versions starting from 
R10, up to three further cracks can form, at 45, 90  and 135 degrees to the ﬁrst crack.  The 
tensile stress is limited to FT only in the availab le crack directions.  The tensile stress in 
other directions is unlimited and could exceed FT. This is a limitation of the non-
rotating crack approach and may lead to models bein g non-conservative, that is, the 
response is stronger than implied by the input.  Th e increase of the possible number of 
cracks from two to four signiﬁcantly reduces this e rror and may therefore cause models 
to seem “weaker” in R10 than in R9 under some loadi ng conditions.  An option to revert 
to the previous 2-crack behavior is available in R1 0 – add 100 to TYPEC. 
 
After initial cracking, the tensile stress reduces with increasing tensile strain.  A ﬁnite 
amount of energy must be absorbed to create a fully  open crack.  In practice the 
reinforcement holds the concrete together, allowing  it to continue to take some tension 
(this eﬀect is known as tension-stiﬀening).  The op tions available for the stress-strain 
curve are shown below.  The piecewise curve is used  by default.  The simple linear 
curve applies only if ESOFT > 0.0 and ECUTEN = 0.0.

 take values 0.0025 and 0.02 respectively. FC max  is also a function of temperature, given 
by the input parameter FC (which applies at 20 oC) times a temperature-dependent 
softening factor taken from EC2.  The diﬀerences am ong TYPEC = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are 
limited to (a) diﬀerent reductions of FC at elevate d temperatures and (b) diﬀerent 
values of |u1D7≠≠c1  at elevated temperatures. 
 
Compressive response for TYPEC = 3 
 
For TYPEC = 3, the stress-strain behaviour follows the same form as described above.  
To over-ride the default values of the Young’s modu lus and |u1D7≠≠cu , set ET36 and ECUT36, 
respectively.  In this case, the strain |u1D7≠≠c1  is calculated from the elastic stiﬀness, and there  
is no thermal sensitivity.  
 
Compressive response for TYPEC = 6 
 
For TYPEC = 6, the above compressive crushing behav iour is replaced with the 
equations proposed by Mander.  This algorithm can m odel unconﬁned or conﬁned 
concrete; for unconﬁned, leave FCC blank.  For conﬁ ned concrete, input the conﬁned 
compressive strength as FCC.   
 
As indicated in Figure M172-3 , |u1D7≠≠c1  is the strain at maximum compressive stress, |u1D7≠≠cu  is 
the ultimate compressive strain, and |u1D7≠≠csp  is the spalling strain.  Default values for these 
quantities for both conﬁned and unconﬁned concrete are calculated as follows: 
|u1D7≠≠c1 = 0.002 × |<racketleftCvJ1 + 5 |parenleftCvJFCC 
FC − 1|parenriµhtCvJ |<racketriµhtCvJ

 The default parameters are intended to be appropria te for a serviceability analysis 
(mean properties), so default FT = f ctm  and default |u1D438 = E cm . For an ultimate load analysis, 
FCC should be the “design compressive strength” (no rmally the factored characteristic 
strength, including any appropriate material factor s); FT should be input as the factored 
characteristic tensile strength; GAMCE9 may be inpu t (a material factor that divides the 
Young’s Modulus so |u1D438 = |u1D438cm GAMCE 9 ⁄ ); and a creep factor PHIEF9 may be input that 
scales |u1D7≠≠c1 by (1 + PHIEF9).  
Unload/Reload Stiffness (All Concrete Types): 
During compressive loading, the elastic modulus wil l be reduced according to the 
parameter UNLFAC (default = 0.5).  See Figure M172-4 .  UNLFAC = 0.0 means no 
reduction, that is, the initial elastic modulus wil l apply during unloading and reloading.  
UNLFAC =1.0 means that unloading results in no perm anent strain.  Intermediate 
values imply a permanent strain linearly interpolat ed between these extremes.  Tensile 
strength is reduced by the same factor as the elast ic modulus. 
Optional Compressive Strength Degradation due to Cr acking: 
By default, the compressive strength of cracked and  uncracked elements is the same.  If 
DEGRAD is non-zero, the formula from BS8110 is used  to reduce compressive strength 
during or after crack opening has occurred:  Figure M172-4.   Concrete unloading behavior A

 RAGG is the crack opening strain at which the input  shear strength TAUMXC 
is halved.  Again, TAUMXC defaults to 1.161 × FT. 
 
Note that if a shear capacity check is speciﬁed, th e above applies only to in-plane shear, 
while the through-thickness shear is unlimited. 
Reinforcement: 
The reinforcement is treated as separate bars provi ding resistance only in the local |u1D46J 
and |u1D466 directions – it does not carry shear in-plane or o ut of plane.  
 
For TYPER = 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, the behaviour is thermally sensitive and follows stress-
strain relationships of a form deﬁned in EC2. At 20oC (or if no thermal input is deﬁned) 
the behaviour is elastic-perfectly-plastic with You ng’s Modulus EREINF and ultimate 
stress SUREINF, up to the onset of failure, after w hich the stress reduces linearly with 
increasing strain until ﬁnal failure.  At elevated temperatures there is a nonlinear 
transition between the elastic phase and the perfec tly plastic phase, and EREINF and 
SUREINF are scaled down by temperature-dependent fa ctors deﬁned in EC2. The strain 
at which failure occurs depends on the reinforcemen t type (TYPER) and the 
temperature.  For example, for hot-rolled reinforci ng steel at 20 oC failure begins at 15% 
strain and is complete at 20% strain. The thermal e xpansion coeﬃcient is as deﬁned in 
EC2 and is a function of temperature.  This may be overridden by inputting the curve 
LCAPLS.  The diﬀerences between TYPER = 1, 2, 4, 7,  8 are limited to (a) diﬀerent 
reductions of EREINF and SUREINF at elevated temper atures, (b) diﬀerent nonlinear 
transitions between elastic and plastic phases and (c) the strains at which softening 
begins and is complete. 
 
The default stress-strain curve for reinforcement m ay be overridden using TYPER = 5 
and LCRSU. In this case, the reinforcement properti es are not temperature-sensitive and 
the yield stress is given by S U REINF × |u1D4J3 (|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst), where |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 is the load curve value at the 
current plastic strain.  To include failure of the reinforcement, the curve should reduce 
to zero at the desired failure strain and remain ze ro for higher strains.  Note that by 
default LS-DYNA re-interpolates the input curve to have 100 equally-spaced points; if 
the last point on the curve is at very high strain,  then the initial part of the curve may 
become poorly deﬁned. *. 73

 For similar reasons, the shear modulus may reduce w ith plastic strain, but this 
option may sometimes give unstable results. 
5.  Additional Cohesion.   The load curves, LCCPDR, LCCPT, LCCJDR, and LC-
CJT, allow extra cohesion to be speciﬁed as a funct ion of time.  The cohesion is 
additional to that speciﬁed in the material paramet ers.  This is intended for use 
during the initial stages of an analysis to allow a pplication of gravity or other 
loads without cracking or yielding, and for the cra cking or yielding then to be 
introduced in a controlled manner.  This is done by  specifying extra cohesion 
that exceeds the expected stresses initially, then declining to zero.  If no curves 
are speciﬁed, no extra cohesion is applied. 
6.  Time-Dependent Properties.   LCSFAC, the load curve for factor on strength, 
applies simultaneously to the cohesion and tan (P H I)  of the parent material 
and all joints.  This feature is intended for reduc ing the strength of the material 
gradually to explore factors of safety.  If no curv e is present, a constant factor 
of 1 is assumed.  Values much greater than 1.0 may cause problems with stabil- 
ity.  Alternatively, separate functions of time may  be deﬁned for each of the 
properties GMOD, CVAL and PHI using load curves LCG MT, LCCVT and 
LCPHT, respectively.  
7.  ANISO.   The anisotropic factor, ANISO, applies the elasti c shear stiﬀness in the 
global /u1D44B |u1D44D  and /u1D44C |u1D44D  planes.  It can be used only in a pure Mohr-Coulom b mode 
(NPLANES = 0). 
8.  Tensile Pressure Limit.   For a friction angle greater than zero, the Mohr 
Coulomb yield surface implies a tensile pressure li mit equal to 
C V AL tan(P H I) ⁄. By default, voids develop in the material when th is pressure 
limit is reached, and the pressure will never becom e more tensile than the ten- 
sile pressure limit.  The volumetric void strain is  tracked and is reversible if the 
strain is reversed. 
9.  NOVOID.   If NOVOID = 1, then the tensile pressure limit is  not applied and 
stress states in which the pressure is more tensile  than C V AL tan(P H I) ⁄ are 
permitted but will be purely hydrostatic with no sh ear stress.  NOVOID is 
recommended in Multi-Material ALE simulations in wh ich the development of 
voids or air space is already accounted for by the Multi-Material ALE. 
10.  Soil or Rock.   To model soil, set NJOINT = 0. The joints allow m odeling of

 Creating sections for reinforced concrete beams: 
This material model can be used to represent unrein forced concrete (FRACR = 0), steel 
(FRACR = 1), or reinforced concrete with evenly dis tributed reinforcement 
(0 < FRACR < 1). 
Alternatively, use *INTEGRATION_BEAM to deﬁne the s ection, with the PID ﬁeld for 
each integration point being used to identify the M aterial to be used at that integration 
point.  Create one Part for concrete, and another f or steel.  These Parts should reference 
Materials, both of type *. 74  *. 74  
  
 
 
Monotonic loading of the reinforcement results in t he stress-strain curve shown, which 
is parabolic between εsh  and εult . The same curve acts as an envelope on the hystere tic

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCIDK Load curve ID for bulk behavior if constants,  |u1D43∆|u1D4J6Cst, and |u1D6FD/u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst are 
determined using a least squares ﬁt.  This relaxati on curve is 
shown in Figure M175-1 . 
NTK Number of terms desired in bulk ﬁt.  If zero 6 term s are used by 
default.  Currently, the maximum number is set to 6 . 
BSTARTK In the ﬁt, |u1D6FD/u1D̅05|oneCst  is set to zero, |u1D6FD/u1D̅05|twoCst  is set to BSTARTK, |u1D6FD/u1D̅05|threeCst is 10 times 
|u1D6FD/u1D̅05|twoCst, |u1D6FD/u1D̅05|fourCst is 10 times |u1D6FD/u1D̅05|threeCst , and so on.  If z ero, BSTARTK is 
determined by an iterative trial and error scheme.

Figure M175-1.   Relaxation curve.  This curve deﬁnes stress as a funct ion of 
time where time is deﬁned on a l ogarithmic scale.  For best results, the points 
deﬁned in the load curve should be equally spaced on th e logarithmic scale.  
Furthermore, the load curve should be smooth and deﬁne d in the positive 
quadrant.  If nonphysical values are determined by least squ ares ﬁt, LS-DY NA 
will terminate with an error message after the initializat ion phase is completed.  
If the ramp time for loading is included, then the rel axation which occurs 
during the loading phase is taken into account.  This eﬀ ect may or may not be 
important. *. 75

The Arrhenius and Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) shift  functions account for the eﬀects 
of the temperature on the stress relaxation.  A sca led time, |u1D461|minuteCst, 
|u1D461|minuteCst=/integral.v:Φ(|u1D447)|u1D4J1|u1D461 |u1D461Cst

function is 
Φ(|u1D447) = exp |<racketleftCvJ−|u1D434 |parenleftCvJ1
|u1D447−1
|u1D447REF |parenriµhtCvJ|<racketriµhtCvJ  , 
and the Williams-Landel-Ferry shift function is

|u1D43J + |u1D447 − |u1D447REF |parenriµhtCvJ . 
If all three values (TREF, A, and B) are not zero, the WLF function is used; the 
Arrhenius function is used if B is zero; and no sca ling is applied if all three values are 
zero. *. 76

the coeﬃcients directly.  The latter is recommended . 
LC2 Load curve ID that deﬁnes the instantaneous ela stic respon se in 
compression and tension.  If zero, deﬁne the coeﬃci ents directly.  
Symmetry is not assumed if only the tension side is  deﬁned; therefore, 
deﬁning the response in tension only, may lead to n onphysical behavior 
in compression.  Also, this curve sh ould give a softening response for 
increasing strain without any negative or zero slop es.  A stiﬀening 
curve or one with negative slopes is generally unst able.  
N Number of terms used in the Prony series which must  be less 
than or equal to 6. This number should be equal to the number of 
decades of time covered by the experimental data.  Deﬁne this 
number if LC1 is nonzero.  Carefully check the ﬁt i n the d3hsp  ﬁle 
to ensure that it is valid, since the least square ﬁt is not always 
reliable. 
GSTART Star ting value for least square ﬁt.  If zero, a default  value is set 
equal to the inverse of the largest time in the exp eriment.  Deﬁne 
this number if LC1 is nonzero. 
M Number of terms used to determine the instantaneous  elastic 
response.  This variable is ignored with the new formulation but 
is kept for compatibility with the previous input.

To avoid sudden failure and numerical diﬃculty, mat erial failure, which is usually a 
time point, is modeled as a process of damage growt h.  In this case, the two threshold 
values are chosen as (1 - h)K and  K, where h (also called EH) is a small number chosen 
based on experimental results reﬂecting the range b etween damage initiation and 
material failure. 
 
The damage is deﬁned as function of |u1D4J3: 
|u1D437 =

This deﬁnition indicates that damage is ﬁrst-order continuous.  Under this deﬁnition, 
the tangent stiﬀness matrix will be continuous.  Th e reduced stress considering damage 
eﬀect is 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = (1 − |u1D437)|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D45C.st 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D45C.st is the undamaged stress.  It is assumed that prior  to ﬁnal failure, material 
damage is recoverable.  Once material failure occur s, damage will become permanent. 
 
The LOG_LOG_INTERPOLATION option interpolates the s train rate eﬀect in the table 
TBID using log-log interpolation. 
 
Bad choices of curves for the stress-strain respons e may lead to an unstable model, and 
there is an option to check this to a certain toler ance level, see dimensionless parameter 
STOL. The check is done by examining the eigenvalue s of the tangent modulus at 
selected stretch points and a warning message is is sued if an eigenvalue is less than –
STOL × BULK, where BULK indicates the bulk modulus of the  material.  For STOL < 0 
the check is disabled, otherwise it should be chose n with care, a too small value may 
detect instabilities that are insigniﬁcant in pract ice.  To avoid signiﬁcant instabilities it is 
recommended to use smooth curves, at best the curve s should be continuously 
diﬀerentiable, in fact for the incompressible case,  a suﬃcient condition for stability is 
that the stress-stretch curve |u1D446(|u1D7≠6)  can be written as

This cohesive material model outputs three traction s having units of force per unit area 
into the D3PLOT database rather than the usual six stress components.  The in plane 
shear traction t1 along the 1-2 edge replaces the x-stress, the orth ogonal in plane shear 
traction t2 replaces the y-stress, and the traction in the nor mal direction t3  replaces the z-
stress. 
 
 
Used in XFEM, TLS corresponding to |u1D6FF|twoCst |u1D4J6|u1D4JB  above equations is replaced with TLS2. Since 
the initially rigid cohesive law is used, element f ails only when the stress level reaches 
the SIGMAX and Λ|oneCst is only used to deﬁne the penetration stiﬀness in case of crack 
closing (compression). *. 86  
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
TES Type of eﬀective separation parameter (ESP). 
EQ.0.0 or 1.0: a dimensional separation measure is used.  For 
the interaction between mode I and II, a mixed-
mode propagation criterion is used.  For 
TES = 0.0 this is a power-law, and for TES = 1.0 
this is the Benzeggagh- Kenane law [1996].  See 
remarks below. 
EQ.2.0: a dimensionless separation measure is used, 
which grasps for the interaction between mode I 
displacements and mode II displacements (simi- 
lar to . 85).

 First and second formulation (TES = 0.0 and TES = 1 .0): 
For mixed-mode behavior, three diﬀerent formulation s are possible (where default 
TES = 0.0 with XMU = 1.0 is recommended as a ﬁrst t ry).  Here, the total mixed-mode

(mode II).  See Figure M186-2 . The ultimate mixed-mode displacement |u1D6FF|u1D439Cst (total failure)

Load Curves: 
Material SAMP-1 uses three yield curves internally to evaluate a quadratic yield 
surface.  *. 87  *. 87  
 2.  Unsolvable Yield Surface Case.   Since the generality of arbitrary curve 
inputs allows unsolvable yield surfaces, SAMP may m odify curves internally.  
This will always lead to warning messages at the be ginning of the simulation 
run.  One modiﬁcation that is not allowed are negat ive tangents of the last two 
data points of any of the yield curves. 
3.  RBCFAC.   If RBCFAC is nonzero and curves LCID-T, LCID-C, L CID-S, and 
LCID-B are speciﬁed, the yield surface in /u1D4:C|oneCst-|u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst|u1D4JACst  -stress space is constructed 
such that a piecewise-linear yield surface is activ ated.  This option can help 
promote convergence of the plasticity algorithm.  Figure M187-1  illustrates the 
eﬀect of RBCFAC on behavior in biaxial compression.   
4.  Dynamic Ampliﬁcation Factor for Yield Stress.   If LCID-T is given as a table 
specifying strain-rate scaling of the yield stress,  then the compressive, shear 
and biaxial yield stresses are computed by multiply ing their respective static 
values by dynamic ampliﬁcation factor (dynamic/stat ic ratio) of the tensile 
yield stress. 
5.  Instability Criterion.   Instability at an integration point is a value be tween 0 
and 1 indicating the integration point’s proximity to damage start.  If instabil- 
ity reaches 1, then damage starts and grows from 0 to 1. The element then 
“ruptures”.  The choice of INCFAIL determines how i nstability is calculated.  
For INCFAIL = 0, 
insta b ility = |parenleftCv1e q ui v alent plastic strain|parenriµhtCv1/EPFAIL

Variable CRPLAW        
Type F        
 
 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
CRPLAW Creep law deﬁnition (see Remarks): 
EQ.0.0: Garofalo’s hyperbolic sine law (default) 
EQ.1.0: Norton’s power law 
Remarks: 
If LCSS is not deﬁned, the uniaxial stress-strain c urve has the form 
|u1D7≠∆|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D444|u1D4JFCst|oneCst/˙racketleft.v21 − exp|parenleftCv2−|u1D436|u1D4JFCst|oneCst|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2/˙racketright.v2+ |u1D444|u1D4JFCst|twoCst/˙racketleft.v21 − exp|parenleftCv2−|u1D436|u1D4JFCst|twoCst|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2/˙racketright.v2
+ |u1D444/u1D̅12.st|oneCst/˙racketleft.v21 − exp|parenleftCv2−|u1D436/u1D̅12.st|oneCst|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2/˙racketright.v2+ |u1D444/u1D̅12.st|twoCst/˙racketleft.v21 − exp|parenleftCv2−|u1D436/u1D̅12.st|twoCst|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2/˙racketright.v2. 
 
Viscous eﬀects are accounted for using the Cowper-S ymonds model, which scales the 
yield stress with the factor: 
1 + |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst
|u1D436|parenriµhtCv6|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  . 
 
For CRPLAW = 0, the steady-state creep strain rate of Garafalo’s hyperbolic sine 
equation is given by 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J≠Cst= |u1D434[sinh(|u1D43J/u1D̅0F|u1D4J2Cst)]|u1D4JACstexp |parenleftCvJ−|u1D444
|u1D447|parenriµhtCvJ  . 
For CRPLAW = 1, the steady-state creep strain rate is given by Norton’s power law 
equation: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J≠Cst= |u1D434|parenleftCv1/u1D̅0F|u1D4J2Cst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D43JCst|u1D461|u1D4JACst. 
In the above, /u1D̅0F|u1D4J2Cst is the eﬀective elastic stress in the von Mises se nse, |u1D447 is the temperature 
and |u1D461 is the time.  The following is a schematic overvie w of the resulting stress update.  
The multiaxial creep strain increment is given by 
∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J≠Cst= ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J≠Cst3/u1D̅4∫|u1D4J2Cst

The forming limit curve can be input directly as a curve by specifying a load curve id 
with the parameter FLDCID.  When deﬁning such a cur ve, the major and minor strains 
must be input as percentages. 
 
Alternatively, the parameters RN and RT can be used  to calculate a forming limit curve.  
The use of RN and RT is not recommended for non-fer rous materials.  RN and RT are 
ignored if a non-zero FLDCID is deﬁned. 
 
The ﬁrst history variable is the maximum strain rat io deﬁned by: 
|u1D7≠≠ma jor wor k piece 
|u1D7≠≠ma jor fld  
corresponding to |u1D7≠≠|mCst|iCst|nCst /o.st/r.stwor k piece .  A value between 0 and 1 indicates that the strain s lie 
below the forming limit curve.  Values above 1 indi cate that the strains are above the 
forming limit curve. *. 91

 b)  Take the absolute value of the current plastic rot ation, and record the 
maximum achieved up to the current time.  This is t he high-tide mark of 
plastic rotation. 
If DEGRAD = 0, “Plastic rotation at End 2” is the c urrent plastic rotation at 
Node 2.  If DEGRAD = 1 or 2, “Plastic rotation at E nd 2” is the current total 
rotation at Node 2.  The total rotation is a more i ntuitively understood parame- 
ter, such as for plotting hysteresis loops.  Howeve r, with DEGRAD = 0, the 
previous meaning of that output variable has been r etained such that results 
from existing models are unchanged.  
FEMA thresholds are the plastic rotations at which the element is deemed to 
have passed from one category to the next, e.g. “El astic”, “Immediate Occu- 
pancy”, “Life Safe”, etc.  The high-tide plastic ro tation (maximum of Y and Z) 
is checked against the user-deﬁned limits FEMA1, FE MA2, etc.  The output 
ﬂag is then set to 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4: 0 means that t he rotation is less than FEMA1; 1 
means that the rotation is between FEMA1 and FEMA2,  and so on.  By con- 
touring this ﬂag, it is possible to see quickly whi ch joints have passed critical 
thresholds.  
6.  Output.   For this material model, special output parameter s are written to the 
d3plot  and d3thdt  ﬁles.  The number of output parameters for beam el ements 
is automatically increased to 20 (in addition to th e six standard resultants) 
when parts of this material type are present.  Some  post-processors may inter- 
pret this data as if the elements were integrated b eams with 4 integration 
points.  Depending on the post-processor used, the data may be accessed as 
follows: 
 
Extra Variable # (Integration 
Point 4 Description) Data Description 
16 (or Axial Stress) FEMA rotation ﬂag 
17 (or XY Shear Stress) current utilization 
18 (or ZX Shear Stress) maximum utilization to

See Table 3 in Ellison et al for example input para meter values. 
2.  Elastic Stiffness.  The elastic bulk modulus is given by |u1D4JD′/u1Dℜ04⁄, where |u1D4JD′ is the 
current mean effective stress (compression positive ), and the small-strain 
elastic shear modulus is calculated from the bulk m odulus and Poisson’s ratio 
RNU.  
3.  Nonlinear Stress-Strain Response. The curve RLCID deﬁnes the nonlinear 
behavior in terms of secant stiffness degradation.  The same curve is assumed 
to apply to all six BRICK stress-strain components.   For example, shear in the 
|u1D46J /u1D46̅-plane will follow the curve, such that the |u1D46J-axis points correspond to shear 
angle |u1D6F∆|u1D46JCst|u1D467Cst , while the |u1D466-axis contains |u1D43A |u1D43Amax ⁄ , where |u1D43A is the secant stiﬀness 
(equal to /u1D̅0F|u1D46JCst|u1D467Cst |u1D6F∆|u1D46JCst|u1D467Cst ⁄) and |u1D43A|u1D4JACst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D46JCst  is the small-strain elastic shear modulus.  
4.  Model Requirements.   This material type requires that the model be ori ented 
such that the /u1D46̅-axis is deﬁned in the upward direction.  Compressi ve initial 
stress must be deﬁned, using, for example, *INITIAL _STRESS_SOLID or *INI-*. 92  
 platforms.  Nevertheless, the 2015 version is recom mended.  THEORY = 0, 4, 
and 104 are retained only for backward compatibilit y. 
9.  Shape Factor.   The shape factor for a typical soil would be 1.25 .  Do not use 
values higher than 1.35.  
10.  Anisotropy.   Anisotropy is treated by applying stretch factors  to the strain axis 
of the stress-strain curves for certain BRICK shear  components.  It may be de- 
ﬁned by either  using THEORY = 204 or 304 together with RVHHH on C ard 3b 
or  using THEORY = 7 or 107 with the parameters on Car d 3c.  Using THEO-
RY = 4 or 104 with non-zero anisotropy parameters o n Card 3a is permitted but 
not recommended.  See Ellison et al (2012) for desc ription of the anisotropy 
eﬀects modelled by THEORY = 7/107 and the meaning o f the parameters on 
Card 3c.  If anisotropy is not required, use THEORY  = 204 or 304 and leave 
Card 3b blank.  “Vertical” and “horizontal” are deﬁ ned in the global coordi- 
nate system with “vertical” being the global /u1D46̅-axis. 
11.  TOL and SUBINC.   These parameters usually have little inﬂuence on the 
result.  Smaller values may sometimes improve accur acy, at cost of greater run 
times.  
12.  Creep.  Creep is implemented by scaling the strain “string  lengths” (see RL-
CID) as a function of strain rate: 
|u1D446 = SLRATIO × |u1D446RLCID |<racketleftCvJ1 + BETAC ×/u1D45∫|u1D4JB |parenleftCvJ||u1D7≠≠̇|
|u1D7≠≠̇ref + 1|parenriµhtCvJ |<racketriµhtCvJ 
Where  |u1D446 is string length; |u1D446|u1D44JCst|u1D43FCst /u1D4:6.st/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:̅.st  are the string lengths in the curve RLCID; 
SLRATIO and BETAC are input parameters on Card 4; ||u1D7≠≠̇| is strain rate; and |u1D7≠≠̇ref  
is input parameter EPSDOT1 or EPSDOT2 for volumetri c and shear strains, 
respectively.  Note that SLRATIO × |u1D446RLCID  gives the string lengths for zero 
strain rate.

 Other terms are as above.  This formula is not incl uded in the material model: TMAX 
should be calculated by hand and entered on Card 1 if the Fukuzawa formula is 
required. 
 
It should be noted that none of the available formu lae, including Fukuzawa, predict the 
ultimate shear stress accurately for all situations .  Variance from the experimental 
results can be as great as 50%. 
 
The shear stress vs shear strain curve is then cons tructed automatically as follows, using 
the algorithm of Fukuzawa extended by Arup: 
1.  Assume ultimate engineering shear strain, |u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst= 0.004 8 
2.  First point on curve, corresponding to concrete cr acking, is at 
|parenleftCvJ0.3 ×TMAX 
|u1D43A, 0.3 × TMAX|parenriµhtCvJ, 
where |u1D43A is the elastic shear modulus given by 
|u1D43A =|u1D438
2(1 +/u1D̅08). 
3.  Second point, corresponding to the reinforcement y ield, is at 
(0.5 × |u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst, 0.8× TMAX). 
4.  Third point, corresponding to the ultimate strengt h, is at 
(|u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst, TMAX). 
5.  Fourth point, corresponding to the onset of streng th reduction, is at 
(2|u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst,TMAX). 
6.  Fifth point, corresponding to failure is at 
(3|u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst, 0.6 × TMAX). 
 
After failure, the shear stress drops to zero.  The  curve points can be entered by the user 
if desired, in which case they over-ride the automa tically calculated curve.  However, it 
is anticipated that in most cases the default curve  will be preferred due to ease of input.

Remarks: 
The stress strain behavior may be treated using a b ilinear stress strain curve through 
deﬁning the tangent modulus, ETAN. An eﬀective stre ss as a function of eﬀective 
plastic strain curve (LCSS) may be input instead of  deﬁning ETAN.  The cost is roughly 
the same for either approach.  The most general app roach is to use the table deﬁnition 
(LCSS) discussed below. 
 
Three options to account for strain rate eﬀects are  possible. 
1.  Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate.  |u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
2.  For complete generality a load curve (LCSR) to sca le the yield stress may be 
input instead.  In this curve the scale factor as a  function of strain rate is de- 
ﬁned. 
3.  If diﬀerent stress as a function of strain curves can be provided for various 
strain rates, the option using the reference to a t able (LCSS) can be used. *. 96

where /u1D4:F/p.st/l.st|aCst|sCst|tCst|iCst /c.st is the plastic deﬂection, given by

|u1D446 + |u1D43∆|mCst|aCst|xCst   . 
The maximum elastic stiﬀness is |u1D43∆|mCst|aCst|xCst = max(|u1D43∆, 2 × |u1D446|mCst|aCst|xCst ), where |u1D446 is the slope 
of FLCID. The trial force is checked against the yi eld force to determine |u1D439: 
|u1D439 = |<raceleftCvJ|u1D439/u1D44C.stif  |u1D439|u1D447Cst> |u1D439/u1D44C.st

on seismic isolators. 
2.  Sliding Surface for Sliding Isolator.   The RADX and RADY inputs for the 
sliding isolator are optional.  If left blank, the sliding surface is assumed to be 
ﬂat.  A cylindrical surface is obtained by deﬁning either RADX or RADY; a 
spherical surface can be deﬁned by setting RADX = R ADY. The eﬀect of the 
curved surface is to add a restoring force proporti onal to the horizontal dis- 
placement from the center.  As seen in elevation, t he top of the isolator will 
follow a curved trajectory, lifting as it displaces  away from the center. 
3.  Vertical Behavior of the Isolator.  The vertical behavior for all types is linear 
elastic, but with diﬀerent stiﬀnesses for tension a nd compression.  By default, 
the tensile stiﬀness is zero for the sliding types.   For the elastomeric type in the 
case of uplift, the tensile stiﬀness will be diﬀere nt from the compressive stiﬀ- 
ness.  For the sliding type, compression is treated  as linear elastic, but no ten- 
sion can be carried. 
4.  Vertical Preload.  Vertical preload can be modeled either explicitly (for 
example, by deﬁning gravity), or by using the PRELO AD input.  PRELOAD 
does not lead to any application of vertical force to the model.  It is added to 
the compression in the element before calculating t he friction force and ten- 
sile/compressive vertical behavior. 
5.  Overview of ITYPE.   Various settings of ITYPE are described as follow s. 
a)  ITYPE = 0 is used to model a single (spherical) pe ndulum bearing.  Triple 
pendulum bearings can be modelled using three of th ese elements in se- 
ries, following the method described by Fenz and Co nstantinou 2008. 
b)  ITYPE = 2 is intended to model uplift-prevention s liding isolators that 
consist of two perpendicular curved beams joined by  a connector that can 
slide in slots on both beams.  The beams are aligne d in the local |u1D46J and |u1D466 
axes, respectively.  The vertical displacement is t he sum of the displace- 
ments induced by the respective curvatures and slid er displacements 
along the two beams.  Single-axis sliding is obtain ed by using YLOCK to 
lock the local |u1D466 displacement.  To resist uplift, STIFFTS must be d eﬁned 
(recommended value: same as STIFFV).  This isolator  type allows for 
diﬀerent friction coeﬃcients on each beam as well a s diﬀerent values in 
tension and compression.  The total friction, takin g into account sliding 
velocity and the friction history functions, is ﬁrs t calculated using FMAX 
which applies to the local |u1D46J-axis when in compression, and then scaled as 
necessary, such as by FMAXXT/FMAX (for the local |u1D46J-axis when in ten- 
sion) and by FMAXYC/FMAX or FMAXYT/FMAX for the |u1D466-axis as ap- 
propriate.  For this reason, FMAX should not be zer o. *. 97  
 7.  Rotational Stiffness.  By default, this element has no rotational stiﬀness  - a 
pin joint is assumed.  However, if required, “oﬀset  moments” can be generated 
according to the vertical load multiplied by the la teral displacement of the iso- 
lator.  This is invoked using MX1, MX2, MY1, MY2. T he moment about  the local 
|u1D46J-axis (meaning the moment that is dependent on late ral displacement in the 
local |u1D466-direction) is reacted on nodes 1 and 2 of the elem ent in the proportions 
MX1 and MX2, respectively.  Similarly, moments abou t the local |u1D466-axis are 
reacted in the proportions MY1 and MY2. These input s eﬀectively determine 
the location of the pin joint.  
For example, consider an isolator installed between  the top of the foundation 
of a building (Node 1 of the isolator element) and the base of a column of the 
superstructure (Node 2 of the isolator element).  T o model a pin at the base of 
the column and react the oﬀset moment on the founda tion, set 
MX1 = MY1 = 1.0 and MX2 = MY2 = 0.0. For the same m odel, MX1 = MY1 = 0.0 
and MX2 = MY2 = 1.0 would imply a pin at the top of  the foundation - all the 
moment is transferred to the column.  Some isolator  designs have the pin at the 
bottom for moments about one horizontal axis, and a t the top for the other axis 
- these can be modeled by setting MX1 = MY2 = 1.0 a nd MX2 = MY1 = 0.0. 
MX1, MX2, MY1 and MY2 are all expected to be greate r than or equal to 0 and 
less than or equal to 1. Also, if MX1 and MX2 are n ot both zero, then 
MX1 + MX2 is expected to equal 1.0, and similarly f or MY1 and MY2. Howev- 
er, no error checks are performed to ensure this. 
Optionally, rotational stiﬀnesses that resist rotat ion of Node 2 relative to Node 
1 may be deﬁned on Card 9 .  These moments are applied equal and opposite 
on Nodes 1 and 2, irrespective of the settings of M X1, MX2, MY1 and MY2.    
8.  Density.   Density should be set to a reasonable value, say 2000 to 8000 kg/m 3. 
The element mass will be calculated as density × vo lume (volume is entered on 
*SECTION_BEAM). 
9.  SECTION_BEAM Input.  Note on values for *SECTION_BEAM: 
a)  Set ELFORM to 6 (discrete beam). 
b)  VOL (the element volume) might typically be set to  0.1 m3. 
c)  INER always needs to be non-zero.  It will inﬂuenc e the solution only 
when the element has rotational stiﬀness, that is, when any of MX1, MX2, 
MY1, MY2, KTHX, KTHY or KTHZ are non-zero.  A reaso nable value 
might be 10-20 kg-m2. 
d)  CID can be left blank if the isolator is aligned i n the global coordinate sys- 
tem, otherwise a coordinate system should be refere nced. *. 98

1.  The joint plane orientations are deﬁned by the ang le of a “downhill vector” 
drawn on the plane, i.e. the vector is oriented wit hin the plane to obtain the 
maximum possible downhill angle.  DIP is the angle of this line below the hor- 
izontal.  DIPANG is the plan-view angle of the line  (pointing down hill) meas- 
ured clockwise from the global Y-axis about the glo bal Z-axis. 
2.  The joint planes rotate with the rigid body motion  of the elements, irrespective 
of whether their initial deﬁnitions are in the glob al or local axis system. 
3.  The full facilities of the modiﬁed Drucker Prager model for the matrix material 
can be used – see description of Material type 193.  Alternatively, to speed up 
the calculation, the ELASTIC ﬂag can be set to 1, i n which case the yield surface *. 98

11.  Joint planes would generally be deﬁned in the glob al axis system if they are 
taken from survey data.  However, the material mode l can also be used to rep- 
resent masonry, in which case the weak planes repre sent the cement and lie 
parallel to the local element axes. *. 99

4.  A Failure Criterion for Nonlinear Strain Paths (NLP ).   The NLP failure 
criterion and corresponding post processing procedu res are described in the 
entries for *. 85  but considers eﬀects of plasticity and 
rate-dependency.  Since the entire separation at fa ilure is plastic, no brittle fracture 
behavior can be modeled with this material type. 
 
The following description of the model is for two d eformation/fracture modes (I and II) 
only, meaning without the option 3MODES. This is a natural choice for cohesive solid 
elements, where no speciﬁc distinction between in-p lane and out-of-plane shear can be 
made.  On the other hand, if this material model is  used with the cohesive shell element 
type ±29, shear deformation can clearly be separate d into in-plane shear (Mode II) and 
out-of-plane shear (Mode III).  This can be taken i nto account by adding 3MODES to the 
keyword and deﬁning additional Cards 4 and 5. Corre sponding equations including 
Mode III are not explicitly given here (for the sak e of brevity), but derivation of them is 
straightforward.  
 
The separations, ∆|u1D4JBCst and ∆|u1D461Cst, in the normal (peel) and tangential (shear) direc tions, 
respectively, are calculated from the element’s sep arations in the integration points, 
∆|u1D4JBCst= max (|u1D462|u1D4JBCst, 0) 
and 
∆|u1D461Cst=/radical.v2|u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst|twoCst+ |u1D462|u1D461Cst|twoCst|twoCst  . 
|u1D462|u1D4JBCst is the separation in the normal direction while |u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst and |u1D462|u1D461Cst|twoCst is the separation in both 
tangential directions of the element coordinate sys tem.  The total (mixed-mode) 
separation ∆|u1D4JACst is determined by 
∆|u1D4JACst=/radical.v2∆|u1D4JBCst|twoCst+ ∆|u1D461Cst|twoCst  .

moduli and are respectively,
