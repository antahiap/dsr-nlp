LS-DYNA R13 2-133 (MAT) 5.  FLUID Keyword Option.   For the FLUID keyword option, the bulk modulus 
ﬁeld, |u1D43∆, must be deﬁned, and both the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio 
ﬁelds are ignored.  Fluid-like behavior is obtained  where the bulk modulus, |u1D43∆, 
and pressure rate, |u1D4JD, are given by: 
|u1D43∆ =|u1D438
3(1 − 2/u1D̅08)
|u1D4JḊ= − |u1D43∆|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J6Cst  
and the shear modulus is set to zero.  A tensor vis cosity is used which acts only 
the deviatoric stresses, |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst, given in terms of the damping coeﬃcient as: 
|u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst=V C × ∆/u1D4:F× |u1D44∆ × |u1D7≠+|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst 
where ∆/u1D4:F is a characteristic element length, |u1D44∆ is the ﬂuid bulk sound speed, |u1D7≠+ is 
the ﬂuid density, and |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst is the deviatoric strain rate. *. _FLUID) for fu rther details.
