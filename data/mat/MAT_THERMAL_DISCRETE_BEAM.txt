This is thermal material type 5.  It deﬁnes propert ies for discrete beams.  It is only 
applicable when used with *SECTION_BEAM elform = 6.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
TMID Thermal material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or  label not 
exceeding 8 characters must be speciﬁed. 
TRO Thermal density: 
EQ.0.0:  default to structural density.  
HC Speciﬁc heat 
TC Thermal conductance (SI units are W/K) 
 HC  =  (heat transfer coeﬃcient) × (beam cross section area) 
[W/K]  =  [W / m^2 K] * [m^2] 
Note: 
A beam cross section area is not deﬁned on the SECT ION_BEAM keyword for an 
elform = 6 discrete beam.  A beam cross section are a is needed for heat transfer 
calculations.  Therefore, the cross section area is  lumped into the value entered for HC. *
