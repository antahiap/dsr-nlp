This is Material Type 249. This material model desc ribes a reinforced thermoplastic 
composite material with its damage and failure beha vior.  The reinforcement is 
modeled as an anisotropic hyper-elastic material wi th up to three distinguished ﬁber 
directions.  It can be used to model unidirectional  layers as well as woven and non-
crimped fabrics.  The matrix is modeled with a simp le elastic plastic material 
formulation.  For a composite, the overall stress i s found by adding the ﬁber and matrix 
stresses.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
ﬁber strain (for compression and elongation).  If D AF2 refers to a 
table, then two diﬀerent damage functions for tensi le and 
compressive stresses are input.  The values in the table are 
arbitrary and exist only to index the two curves.  The ﬁrst indexed 
curve is assumed to specify tensile damage as a fun ction of ﬁber 
strains while second curve speciﬁes compressive dam age as a 
function of ﬁber strains.  i nput different damage functions for 
tensile and compressive stresses.  Any other curves  input with the 
table definition are ignored.  
The damager parameter |u1D4J1|twoCst/u1D45:.st ranges from 0.0 for an undamaged 
ﬁber to 1.0 for a failed ﬁber family.  If all famil ies have failed, 
material failure at the integration point is initia ted.  
DAM2 Load curve or table ID for damage parameter |u1D4J1|twoCst|u1D4JACstfor matrix 
material based on the current deformation status of  the 2 nd  ﬁber 
(see Remark 2 ). If a curve, it speciﬁes damage as a function of 
ﬁber strain (for compression and elongation).  If a  table, then the 
values are ﬁber strain rates which index damage as a function of 
ﬁber strain curves. 
The damager parameter |u1D4J1|twoCst|u1D4JACst ranges from 0.0 to 1.5. A value of 0.0 
indicates an undamaged matrix, whereas 1.0 refers t o a 
completely damaged matrix.  To initiate failure of the composite 
at the integration point, a matrix damage |u1D4J1|twoCst|u1D4JACst of 1.5 must be 
reached.  Naturally, the mechanic al behavior of the matrix does 
not change for damage values between 1.0 and 1.5.

 For even values of METH ij,  an elastic shear response is assumed.  If deﬁned, 
the load curve LCG ij corresponds to function |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J7Cst. In this case the values of G ij, 
ALOC ij  and GLOC ij are ignored. 
For odd values of METH ij  on the other hand, an elasto-plastic shear behavio r is 
assumed and the load curve LCG ij deﬁnes the yield stress value as function of 
a normalized shear parameter.  This implies that th e load curve needs to be 
deﬁned for abscissa values between 0.0 and 1.0. A ﬁ rst elastic regime, which is 
controlled by the linear shear stiﬀness G ij , is assumed until the yield stress 
given in the load curve for normalized shear value 0.0 is reached.  A second 
linear elastic regime is deﬁned for shear angles ( /u1D̅0∫|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst )/ ﬁber angles ( |u1D7≠2|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst ) larger 
than the locking angle ALOC ij . The corresponding stiﬀness in that regime is 
GLOC ij.  At the transition point to the second elastic regi me, the shear stress 
corresponds to the load curve value for a normalize d shear of 1.0. 
2.  Damage and Failure.   This material features a phenomenological descripti on 
of damage and failure.  User-deﬁned load curves spe cify several damage vari- 
ables as functions of the ﬁber strain values  |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst or shear /u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst. Here, damage 
parameters are always accumulated and cannot decrea se during the simula- 
tion. 
If input parameter DAF i refers to a load curve, it speciﬁes the damage par ame- 
ter |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st as function of the ﬁber strain |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst. If DAF i refers to a table, the material 
distinguishes between tensile and compressive damag e.  In that case, two pa- 
rameters |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D461Cst and |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J≠Cst are introduced as functions of the ﬁber strain |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst (given by 
two load curves referred to by the table deﬁnition)  and are both evaluated in 
every time step.  The eﬀective damager parameter |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st is then deﬁned as  
|u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst) =
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧|u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J≠Cst(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst), |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst< 0
|u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D461Cst(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst), |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst≥ 0 
The damage parameter |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st degrades the ﬁber stress contribution /u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st:

|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
Failure of the composite material at the integratio n point is initiated as soon as 
all ﬁbers have failed: min 
|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st= 1.0 . 
We assume matrix damage to result from the ﬁber str aining and reorientating.  
Consequently, the input includes load curves DAM i and DAM ij  to specify 
damage parameters |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JACst(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst) and |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst|u1D4JACst|parenleftCv1/u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst|parenriµhtCv1, respectively.  The overall matrix

The above table also shows the order of output as w ell as the number of extra 
history variables associated with the particular ﬂa g.  In total NXH extra varia- 
bles are required depending on the choice of parame ter POSTV. For example, 
the maximum number of additional variables is NXH =  32 for POSTV = 127. 
As mentioned in Remark 1  ﬁber orientation is represented in the material su b- 
routine as vector /u1D426|iCst deﬁned in the element coordinate system.  Prior to  writing 
to the list of histories the vector is transformed into the global coordinate sys- 
tem with three vector components for |u1D44∆|fourCst= 1 and/or into the overall  material 
coordinate system with two vector components for  |u1D44∆|sevenCst= 1.
