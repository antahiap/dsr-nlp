  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
FLCID Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning force as a 
function of deﬂection for nonlinear behavior. 
HLCID Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning force as a 
function of relative velocity for nonlinear behavio r (optional).  If 
the origin of the curve is at (0,0) , the force magnitude is identical 
for a given magnitude of the relative velocity, tha t is, only the 
sign changes. 
C1 Damping coeﬃcient for nonlinear behavior (option al). 
C2 Damping coeﬃcient for nonlinear behavior (option al). 
DLE Factor to scale time units.  The default is uni ty. 
GLCID Optional load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning a scale 
factor as a function of deﬂection for load curve ID , HLCID.  If 
zero, a scale factor of unity is assumed. 
Remarks: 
If the linear spring stiﬀness is used, the force, |u1D439, is given by: 
|u1D439 = |u1D439|zeroCst+ K∆/u1D4:F+ D∆/u1D4:Ḟ  . 
But if the load curve ID is speciﬁed, the force is then given by: 
|u1D439 = |u1D439|zeroCst+ K|u1D4J3 (∆/u1D4:F)/˙raceleft.v61 + C1 × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ+ C2 × sgn|parenleftCv1∆/u1D4:Ḟ|parenriµhtCv1ln |<racketleftCv6max |parenleftCv61. ,∆/u1D4:Ḟ

+ |u1D4J4(∆/u1D4:F)ℎ|parenleftCv1∆/u1D4:Ḟ|parenriµhtCv1  . 
In these equations, ∆/u1D4:F is the change in length, that is,  
∆/u1D4:F= current length − initial length  .  
The cross-sectional area is deﬁned on the section c ard for the discrete beam elements; 
see *SECTION_BEAM.  The square root of this area is  used as the contact thickness 
oﬀset if these elements are included in the contact  treatment. *
