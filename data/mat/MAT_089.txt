  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
ﬁlter to remove high frequency oscillation from the  strain rates 
before th ey are used in rate eﬀect calculations.  The cut oﬀ  
frequency of the ﬁlter is [(1 - RFAC) / timestep] r ad/sec. 
LCFAIL Load curve ID giving variation of failure strain wi th strain rate.  
The points on the |u1D46J-axis should be natural log of strain rate, wh ile 
the |u1D466-axis should be the true strain to failure.  Typical ly, this is 
measured by a uniaxial tensile test, and the strain  values are 
converted to true strain. 
NUMINT Number of integration points which must fail before  the element 
is deleted.  This option is available for shells on ly. 
LT.0.0: |N U MINT|  is percentage of integration points/layers 
which must fail before shell element fails. 
Remarks: 
1.  *.  is the same as *.   *.   
 9.  Shell Numbering.   Invariant shell numbering is recommended when usi ng 
this material model.  See *CONTROL_ACCURACY. *
