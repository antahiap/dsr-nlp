 The stress and strain pairs in load curve LCPY shou ld be positive values start- 
ing with a volumetric strain value of zero. 
2.  LCUYS.   The load curve LCUYS can optionally contain the r esults of the 
tensile test (corresponding to negative values of t he volumetric strain); if it 
does, then the load curve information will override  PC, VPC, TC and VTC. 
This is the recommended approach, because the neces sary continuity between 
tensile and compressive regime becomes obvious (see  Figure M75-1 ). 
3.  Yield Surface.   The yield surface is deﬁned as an ellipse in the equivalent 
pressure and von Mises stress plane.  This ellipse is characterized by three 
points: 
a)  the hydrostatic compression limit (LCPY), 
b)  the uniaxial compression limit (LCUYS), and 
c)  either the pressure cutoﬀ for hydrostatic stress ( PC,VPC), the tension cut- 
oﬀ for uniaxial tension (TC,VTC), or the optional t ensile part of LCUYS. 
4.  High Frequency Oscillations.  To prevent high frequency oscillations in the 
strain rate from causing similar high frequency osc illations in the yield stress, a 
modiﬁed volumetric strain rate is used to obtain th e scaled yield stress.  The 
modiﬁed strain rate is obtained as follows.  If NYC LE is > 1, then the modiﬁed 
strain rate is obtained by a time average of the ac tual strain rate over NCYCLE 
solution cycles.  The averaged strain rate is store d in history variable #3. Volumetric Strain True Stress
