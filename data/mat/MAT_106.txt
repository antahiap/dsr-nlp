  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
P Viscous material parameter, |u1D4JD 
LCE Load curve deﬁning Young's modulus as a function of 
temperature.  E on Card 1 is ignored with this opti on. 
LCPR Load curve deﬁning Poisson's ratio as a function of  temperature.  
PR on Card 1 is ignored with this option. 
LCSIGY Load curve deﬁning the initial yield stress as a fu nction of 
temperature.  SIGY on Card 1 is ignored with this o ption. 
LCR Load curve for scaling the isotropic hardening para meters QR1 
and QR2 or the stress given by the load curve LC SS as a function 
of temperature 
LCX Load curve for scaling the kinematic hardening para meters QX1 
and QX2 as a function of temperature 
LCALPH Load curve ID deﬁning the instantaneous coeﬃcient o f thermal 
expansion as a function of temperature: 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst thermal = |u1D6F+(|u1D447)|u1D4J1|u1D447|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
ALPHA on Card 1 is ignored with this option.  If LCALPH is 
deﬁned as the negative of the load curve ID, the cu rve is assumed 
to deﬁne the coeﬃcient relative to a reference temp erature, TREF 
below, such that the total thermal strain is given by 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cstthermal = [|u1D6F+(|u1D447)(|u1D447 − |u1D447ref )−|u1D6F+(|u1D447|zeroCst)(|u1D447|zeroCst− |u1D447/r.st|eCst /f.st)]|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  . 
Here, temperature |u1D447|zeroCst is the initial temperature. 
LCC Load curve for scaling the viscous material par ameter |u1D436 as a 
function of temperature.  See Remark 1 . 
LCP Load curve for scaling the viscous material paramet er P as a 
function of temperature 
TREF Reference temperature required if and only if LCALP H is given 
with a negative curve ID 
LCFAIL Load curve deﬁ ning the plastic failure strain as a function of 
temperature.  FAIL on Card 1 is ignored with this o ption.
