STOCHASTIC 
This is  Material Type 98 implementing Johnson/Cook strain s ensitive plasticity.  It is 
used for problems where the strain rates vary over a large range.  In contrast to the full 
Johnson/Cook model (material type 15) this model in troduces the following 
simpliﬁcations: 
1.  thermal eﬀects and damage are ignored, 
2.  and the maximum stress is directly limited since t hermal softening which is 
very signiﬁcant in reducing the yield stress under adiabatic loading is not 
available. 
 
An iterative plane stress update is used for the sh ell elements, but due to the 
simpliﬁcations related to thermal softening and dam age, this model is 50% faster than 
the full Johnson/Cook implementation.  To compensat e for the lack of thermal 
softening, limiting stress values are introduced to  keep the stresses within reasonable 
limits. 
 
A resultant formulation for the Belytschko-Tsay, th e C0 Triangle, and the fully 
integrated type 16 shell elements is available and can be activated by specifying either 
zero or one through thickness integration point on the *SECTION_SHELL card.  While 
less accurate than through thickness integration, t his formulation runs somewhat faster.  
Since the stresses are not computed in the resultan t formulation, the stresses written to 
the databases for the resultant elements are set to  zero. 
 
This model is also available for the Hughes-Liu bea m, the Belytschko-Schwer beam, and 
for the truss element.  For the resultant beam form ulation, the rate eﬀects are 
approximated by the axial rate, since the thickness  of the beam about it bending axes is 
unknown.  Because this model is primarily used for structural analysis, the pressure is 
determined using the linear bulk modulus.
