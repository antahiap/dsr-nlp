Remarks: 
1.  Material Model.   This material model invokes a special membrane el ement 
formulation regardless of the element choice.  It i s an anisotropic hyperelastic 
model where the 2 nd  Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress  /u1D412 is a function of the Green-
Lagrange strain /u1D404 and possibly its history.  Due to anisotropy, this  strain is 
transformed to obtain the strains in each of the ﬁb er directions, |u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st  and |u1D438/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st , 
together with the shear strain, |u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st . The associated stress components in the 
local system are given as functions of the strain c omponents 
|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st =γ|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st (|u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D438/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st )ϑ
|u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st =γ|u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D438/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st , |u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st )ϑ
|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st =γ|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st )ϑ 
The factor |u1D6F∆ is used for dissipative eﬀects and is described in  more detail in 
Remark 4 .  For TH = 0, |u1D6F∆ = 1 .  The function ϑ represents a strain rate scale fac- 
tor (see Remark 6 ); for FXX = FYY = 0 this factor is 1. While the sh ear relation is 
given directly in the input through the curve SXY, the tabular input of the ﬁber 
stress components PXX and PYY is for the sake of co nvenience.  PXX and PYY 
give the engineering stress as function of engineer ing strain, that is, 
|u1D443/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st = |u1D443/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st (|u1D4J2/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st )
|u1D443/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st = |u1D443/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st ) 
Because of this, the following conversion formulae are used between stresses 
and strains 
|u1D4J2 =/radical.v11 + 2|u1D438 − 1
|u1D446 =|u1D443
1 + |u1D4J2 
which are applied in each of the two ﬁber direction s. 
2.  Compressive Stress Elimination.   Compressive stress elimination is optional 
through the CSE parameter, and when activated the p rincipal components of 
the 2 nd  Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress is restricted to positive va lues.  
3.  Reference Geometry and Smooth Stress Initialization .  If a reference 
geometry is used, then SRFAC is the curve ID for a function |u1D6F+(|u1D461) that should 
increase from zero to unity during a short time spa n.  During this time span, *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-335 (MAT) /u1D44A|u1D4J≠Cst= |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cst/u1D4:D|<raceleftCvJln |parenleftCvJ/u1D4:D
/u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst|parenriµhtCvJ − 1|<raceriµhtCvJ ,  for /u1D4:D≤/u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst  . 
Here |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cst (BULKC) is a physical bulk modulus, /u1D4:D= det(/u1D405) is the jacobian of the 
deformation and /u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst (JACC) is the critical jacobian for when the eﬀect  commenc- 
es. /u1D405 is the deformation gradient.  This contributes to the pressure with a term 
|u1D4JD = |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cstln |parenleftCvJ/u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst
/u1D4:D|parenriµhtCvJ ,  for /u1D4:D≤/u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst 
and thus prevents membrane elements from collapsing  or inverting when sub- 
jected to compressive loads.  The bulk modulus |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cst should be selected with the 
slopes in the stress map tables in mind, presumably  some order of magni- 
tude(s) smaller.   
6.  Strain Rate Scale Factor.   As an option, the local membrane stress can be 
scaled based on the engineering strain rates via th e function /u1D̅1̅=/u1D̅1̅(|u1D4J2̇,/u1D412). We set 
|u1D4J2̇= max |parenleftCvJ/u1D̅16̇
‖/u1D405/u1D412‖, 0|parenriµhtCvJ 
to be the equivalent engineering strain rate in the  direction of loading and de- 
ﬁne 
/u1D̅1̅(|u1D4J2̇,/u1D4̅A) =|u1D439/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st (|u1D4J2̇)||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st | + |u1D439/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D4J2̇)||u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st | + 2||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st |
||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st | + ||u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st | + 2||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st |, 
meaning that the strain rate scale factor defaults to the user input data FXX and 
FYY for uniaxial loading in the two material direct ions, respectively.  Note that 
we only consider strain rate scaling in loading and  not in unloading, and fur- 
thermore that the strain rates used in evaluating t he curves are pre-ﬁltered 
using the time window DT to avoid excessive numeric al noise.  It is, therefore, 
recommended to set DT to a time corresponding to at  least hundred time steps 
or so. *
