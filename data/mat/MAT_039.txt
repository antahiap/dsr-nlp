LS-DYNA R13 2-373 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCFLD Load curve ID deﬁning the Forming Limit Diagr am.  Min or 
strains in percent are deﬁned as abscissa values an d major strains 
in percent are deﬁned as ordinate values.  The form ing limit 
diagram is shown in Figure M39-1 .  In deﬁning the curve list p airs 
of minor and major strains starting with the left m ost point and 
ending with the right most point; see *DEFINE_CURVE . 
Remarks: 
See material model 37 for the theoretical basis.  T he ﬁrst history variable is the 
maximum strain ratio:
