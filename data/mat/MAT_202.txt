 TBL_SS is also optional.  It overrides SIGY and the  stress-strain relationships 
from EC3. If present, TBL_SS must be the ID of a *D EFINE_TABLE.  The ﬁeld 
VALUE on the *DEFINE_TABLE should contain the tempe rature at which each 
stress-strain curve is applicable; the temperatures  should be in ascending or- 
der.  The curves that follow the temperature values  have plastic strain on the |u1D46J-
axis and yield stress on the |u1D466-axis as per other LS-DYNA elasto-plastic material 
models.  As with all instances of *DEFINE TABLE, th e curves containing the 
stress-strain data must immediately follow the *DEF INE_TABLE input data 
and must be in the correct order (that is, the same  order as the temperatures). 
3.  Temperature.  Temperature can be deﬁned by any of the *LOAD_THERM AL 
methods.  The temperature does not have to start at  zero: the initial tempera- 
ture will be taken as a reference temperature for e ach element, so non-zero 
initial temperatures will not cause thermal shock e ﬀects. 
4.  Extra History Variables.  Temperature is output by this material model as 
Extra History Variable 1. This can be useful for ch ecking the input in cases 
where temperature varies across the diﬀerent integr ation points, as is the case 
with *LOAD_THERMAL_VARIABLE_BEAM  Figure M202-1.   Stress-Strain Curves at various temperatures 0.02 0.00 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0.20 0.18 0.160.00.20.40.60.81.01.2
