2-264 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 The load curve deﬁnition that provides the uniaxial  data should give the change in 
gauge length, ∆/u1D4:F, versus the corresponding force.  In compression b oth the force and 
the change in gauge length must be speciﬁed as nega tive values.  In tension the force 
and change in gauge length should be input as posit ive values.  The principal stretch 
ratio in the uniaxial direction, |u1D7≠6|oneCst, is then given by 
|u1D7≠6|oneCst=/u1D4:F|zeroCst+ ∆/u1D4:F
/u1D4:F|zeroCst 
with /u1D4:F|zeroCst being the initial length and /u1D4:F being the actual length. 
 
Alternatively, the stress as a function of strain c urve can also be input by setting the 
gauge length, thickness, and width to unity (1.0) a nd deﬁning the engineering strain in 
place of the change in gauge length and the nominal  (engineering) stress in place of the 
force; see Figure M27-1 . 
 
The least square ﬁt to the experimental data is per formed during the initialization 
phase, and a comparison between the ﬁt and the actu al input is provided in the d3hsp  
ﬁle.  It is a good idea to visually check to make s ure it is acceptable.  The coeﬃcients |u1D434 
and |u1D43J are also printed in the output ﬁle.  It is also ad vised to use the material driver (see 
Appendix K) for checking out the material model.

 Phases: 
The material properties for each element are initia lized using the data for the ﬁrst 
phase.  After the center of the element passes thro ugh the transition plane deﬁned by 
the two points, the material properties are irrever sibly changed to the second phase. 
 
The plane is deﬁned by two points.  The ﬁrst point,  deﬁned by the coordinates X1, Y1, 
and Z1, lies on the plane.  The second point, deﬁne d by the coordinates X2, Y2, and Z2, 
deﬁne the exterior normal as a unit vector in the d irection from the ﬁrst point to the 
second point. 
Material Formulation: 
The strain energy density function is deﬁned as: 
/u1D44A= |u1D434(/u1D4:C− 3) + |u1D43J(/u1D4:C/u1D4:C− 3) + |u1D436|parenleftCv2/u1D4:C/u1D4:C/u1D4:C−|twoCst− 1|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D437(/u1D4:C/u1D4:C/u1D4:C− 1)|twoCst 
where 
|u1D436 =  0.5 |u1D434 +  |u1D43J 
|u1D437 =|u1D434(5|u1D71≠ − 2) + |u1D43J(11|u1D71≠ − 5)
2(1 − 2|u1D71≠) 
/u1D̅08 =  Poisson ’s ratio 
2(|u1D434 + |u1D43J)  = shear modulus of linear elasticity 
/u1D4:C,/u1D4:C/u1D4:C,/u1D4:C/u1D4:C/u1D4:C=  in v ariants of right Cauchy-Green Tensor C. 
The load curve deﬁnition that provides the uniaxial  data should give the change in 
gauge length, ∆/u1D4:F, versus the corresponding force.  In compression b oth the force and 
the change in gauge length must be speciﬁed as nega tive values.  In tension the force 
and change in gauge length should be input as posit ive values.  The principal stretch 
ratio in the uniaxial direction, |u1D7≠6|oneCst, is then given by 
|u1D7≠6|oneCst=/u1D4:F|zeroCst+ ∆/u1D4:F
/u1D4:F|zeroCst 
with /u1D4:F|zeroCst being the initial length and /u1D4:F being the actual length.
