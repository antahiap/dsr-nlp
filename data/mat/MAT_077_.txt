Background: 
Rubber is generally considered to be fully incompre ssible since the bulk modulus 
greatly exceeds the shear modulus in magnitude.  To  model the rubber as an 
unconstrained material a hydrostatic work term, /u1D44A|u1D43BCst(/u1D4:D), is included in the strain energy 
functional which is function of the relative volume , /u1D4:D, [Ogden 1984]: 
/u1D44A(/u1D4:D|oneCst,/u1D4:D|twoCst,/u1D4:D) = |summationCv1 |u1D436|u1D4JDCst /u1D45E.st(/u1D4:D|oneCst− 3)|u1D4JDCst(/u1D4:D|twoCst− 3)/u1D45E.st+/u1D44A|u1D43BCst(/u1D4:D)|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4JDCst/co⋯⋯a.st/u1D45E.st=|zeroCst 
/u1D4:D|oneCst=/u1D4:C|oneCst/u1D4:C|threeCst−|oneCst|threeCst/fraction.v2 
/u1D4:D|twoCst=/u1D4:C|twoCst/u1D4:C|threeCst−|twoCst|threeCst/fraction.v2 *. H  
 so each term contributes with an instantaneous shea r stiﬀness of |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst that decays 
with time at a rate determined by |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst. If we deﬁne the relaxation time as 
/u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst= 1 |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst⁄ , 
we see that the term will not contribute much to th e response when |u1D461 > 5/u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst. So 
with several Prony terms with diﬀerent relaxation p roperties, the overall visco- 
elastic stiﬀness decays roughly with steps of |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst in time spans of /u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst. This infor- 
mation can be used for determining the material dat a by making clever use of 
tensile tests at diﬀerent strain rates.  Looking at  the corresponding stress con- 
tribution from each term 
/u1D̅48|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst= 2|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst
|u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts|u1D461Cst|parenriµhtCv2/u1D46B 
we see that the stress stabilizes at a nonzero leve l 2/u1D4:A.st|u1D4J6Csts
/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts/u1D46B as time goes to inﬁnity.  
See Figure M77-1 . 
 
 
2.  Relaxation.  To see its eﬀect on stress relaxation, we assume t he material has 
deformed with a constant rate-of-deformation /u1D46B|zeroCst≠/u1D̅CE between time 0 and |u1D461|zeroCst, 
and then continues with another constant rate-of-de formation /u1D46B (which we 
allow to be zero) after time |u1D461|zeroCst (see Figure M77-2 ). The expression for the stress 
is 
/u1D̅48|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts(|u1D461Cst−|u1D461Cst |zeroCsts)/u1D̅48|zeroCst|u1D4J6Cst+ 2|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst
|u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts(|u1D461Cst−|u1D461Cst |zeroCsts)|parenriµhtCv2/u1D46B, 
where /u1D̅48|zeroCst|u1D4J6Cst is the stress level that was reached at time |u1D461|zeroCst. Stress relaxation occurs 
when /u1D46B=/u1D̅CE for which we see that the stress decays (or relaxes ) to zero at a rate 
determined by |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst. When a hyperelastic material is included, the str ess is re- 
laxed to the hyperelastic stress, illustrated by a dashed line in the ﬁgure.  As 
before, when combining many terms with diﬀerent rel axation properties, the 
stress relaxes in steps of /u1D̅48|zeroCst|u1D4J6Cst in time spans of /u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst and essentially determines the Gi

Remarks: 
1.  Hysteresis (TBHYS > 0).   If a positive table ID for hysteresis is deﬁned , then TB-
HYS is a table having curves that are functions of strain-energy density.  Let 
/u1D44A/d.st |eCst|vCst  be the current value of the deviatoric strain ener gy density as calculated 
above.  Furthermore, let /u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst  be the peak strain energy density reached up to 
this point in time.  It is then assumed that the re sulting stress is reduced by a 
damage factor according to 
/u1D412= |u1D437|parenleftCv1/u1D44A/d.st |eCst|vCst ,/u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst |parenriµhtCv1∂/u1D44A/d.st |eCst|vCst

where |u1D437|parenleftCv1/u1D44A/d.st |eCst|vCst ,/u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst |parenriµhtCv1 is the damage factor which is input as the table, TBHYS.  
This table consists of curves giving stress reducti on (between 0 and 1) as a 
function of /u1D44Ade v  indexed by /u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst . 
Each /u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst  curve must be valid for strain energy densities be tween 0 and /u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst .  
It is recommended  that each curve be monotonically increasing, and i t is required  
that each curve equals 1 when /u1D44Ade v >/u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rtde v .  Additionally, *DEFINE_TABLE 
requires  that each curve have the same beginning and end po int and, further- 
more, that they not cross except at the boundaries,  although they are not re- 
quired to cross. 
This table can be roughly estimated from a uniaxial  quasistatic compression 
test as follows (see Figure  for an illustration of  the diﬀerent curves): 
a)  Load the specimen to a maximum displacement |u1D4J1̅ and measure the force 
as function of displacement, |u1D4J3load (|u1D4J1). (t0,0) 

 2.  Hysteresis (TBHYS < 0).   If a negative table ID for hysteresis is deﬁned, th en 
all of the above holds with the diﬀerence being tha t the load curves comprising 
table, |TB HY S|, must give the strain-energy density, /u1D44Ade v , as a function of the 
stress reduction factor.  This scheme guarantees that all curves have the sam e begin- 
ning point, 0, and the same end point, 1.   For negative TBHYS the user provides 
/u1D44A/d.st |eCst|vCst (|u1D437,/u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst ) instead of |u1D437(/u1D44A/d.st |eCst|vCst ,/u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst ).  In practice, this case corresponds to 
swapping the load curve axes. *. O

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCID2 Load curve ID of the deviatoric stress relaxation c urve, neglecting 
the long term deviatoric stress.  If LCID2 is given , constants |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst
and |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst are determined using a least squares ﬁt.  See M76-1  for an 
example relaxation curve.  The ordinate of the curv e is the 
viscoelastic deviatoric stress divided by the quant ity 2 times the 
constant value of deviatoric strain where the stres s and strain are 
in the direction of the prescribed strain.  If in n on-directional 
terms, it is the eﬀective stress divided by the qua ntity 3 times the 
eﬀective strain.

where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) and |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) are the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent stre ss 
measures.  This stress is added to the stress tenso r determined from the strain energy 
functional. 
 
If we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, the relaxation function is represented by 
six terms from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st |u1D461Cst |u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
given by, 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts|u1D461Cst|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a dampers and springs in 
series.  We characterize this in the input by shear  moduli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6, and decay constants,  |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.  
The viscoelastic behavior is optional, and an arbit rary number of terms may be used.  In 
order to avoid a constant shear modulus from this v iscoelastic formulation, a term in 
the series is included only when  |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst> 0. 
 
For VFLAG = 1, the viscoelastic term is 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D461Cst

∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F  
where |u1D7≠∆/u1D458/u1D45∫|u1D438 is the instantaneous stress evaluated from the int ernal energy functional.  The 
coeﬃcients in the Prony series therefore correspond  to normalized relaxation moduli 
instead of elastic moduli. 
 
The Mooney-Rivlin rubber model (model 27) is obtain ed by specifying |u1D4JB = 1 .  In spite of 
the diﬀerences in formulations with Model 27, we ﬁn d that the results obtained with 
this model are nearly identical with those of Mater ial 27 as long as large values of 
Poisson’s ratio are used. 
 
The frequency independent damping is obtained by th e having a spring and slider in 
series as shown in the following sketch:
