 contact with a hard surface perpendicular to the su rface on which Node 2 
slides.  In that case, the limit distances, DMXPX, DMXNX, DMXPY, and 
DMXNY, represent the initial gap between the point (Node 2) and the hard 
surface. 
Optionally, an initial bond strength can be deﬁned.   The bond forces are in 
addition to any contact and friction forces.  After  breakage of the bond, con- 
tact and sliding can continue to occur. 
If LCZ is deﬁned, compressive loading in the contac t direction follows LCZ 
while unload/reload is linear with stiﬀness STIFF. The value of STIFF must 
not be less than the maximum slope of any segment o f the curve LCZ.  
You can also deﬁne moment stiﬀnesses through KROTX,  KROTY and 
KROTZ. Optionally, these stiﬀnesses can be set to b ecome active at a certain 
time (TKROT).  If TKROT is nonzero, the moment stiﬀ ness will be zero be- 
fore that time and during any dynamic relaxation.  If TKROT is left zero, the 
moment stiﬀness will be active from the start of th e analysis including dur- 
ing dynamic relaxation.  
Damping is applied to the force normal to the surfa ce, to the bond forces, 
and to any forces generated by “hard limits” (LIMPX  etc.), but not to slid- 
ing.  Two damping methods are available: DAMP and D AMPZ/DAMPH. 
DAMP is recommended for general use where the exact  amount of damp- 
ing is unimportant, and the requirement is simply t o remove unwanted 
oscillations.  DAMPZ and DAMPH are available for ca ses where particular 
values of viscous damping coeﬃcient are required.  When LCZ is also de- 
ﬁned and the response is following the load curve ( meaning not during 
unloading/reloading), the damping coeﬃcient DAMPZ i s scaled to the ratio 
of the slope of LCZ to STIFF. The slope of LCZ is t he gradient at the current 
point on the load curve.

Figure M205-1.   Illustration of the two diﬀerent actions that can be app lied to 
the element when Node 2 reaches the edge of the plane.  The left schematic 
depicts the default behavior in which the elem ent is deleted when Node 2 
reaches the edge.  The right image illustrates Node 2 r eaching a hard limit.  
When it reaches this limit, a contact force is applied.  *
