*. .  Instead of the  usual six stress components, three 
traction stresses are written into those databases.   The in-plane shear traction along the 
1-2 edge replaces the |u1D46J component of stress, the orthogonal in-plane shear  traction 
replaces the |u1D466 component of stress, and the traction in the norma l direction replaces the 
/u1D46Ì… component of stress. *.
