  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
PGCL Pre- consolidation ground level.  This parameter deﬁnes the 
maximum surface level (relative to  /u1D46̅ = 0.0 in the model) of the soil 
throughout geological history which is used calcula te the 
maximum overburden pressure on the soil elements. See 
Remark 6 . 
SUB-INC User deﬁned strain increment size.  A typical value  is 0.005. This 
is the maximum strain increment permitted in the it eration 
scheme within the material model.  If the value is exceeded, a 
warning is echoed to the d3hsp  ﬁle.  See Remark 11 . 
BLK The elastic bulk stiﬀness of the soil which is used  for contact 
stiﬀness only. 
GRAV The gravitational acceleration which is used to cal culate the 
element stresses due to the overlying soil.  Defaul t is set to 
9.807 m/s 2.

Remarks: 
1.  Material Behavior and References.  The material model consists of up to 10 
nested elasto-plastic yield surfaces deﬁned in a tr ansformed stress-strain 
space, termed “BRICK” space.  The sizes of the yiel d surfaces are given in 
terms of BRICK strains and are called “string-lengt hs”.  Explanation of the *.   
 TIAL_STRESS_DEPTH. Stresses must remain compressive  throughout the 
analysis. 
5.  Units.   The recommended unit system is kiloNewtons, meter s, seconds, tonnes.  
There are some built-in defaults that assume stress  units of kN/m 2. 
6.  Over-Consolidated Clays.   Over-consolidated clays have suﬀered previous 
loading to higher stress levels than are present at  the start of the analysis due 
to phenomena such as ice sheets during previous ice  ages, or the presence of 
soil or rock that has subsequently been eroded.  Th e maximum vertical stress 
during that time is assumed to be: 
|u1D7≠∆V ,MAX = RO × GRA V × (PGCL − |u1D44Del )  , 
where 
RO, GRA V , and PGCL = input parameters 
|u1D44Del =z coordinate of center of element  
Since that time, the material has been unloaded unt il the vertical stress equals 
the user-deﬁned initial vertical stress.  The previ ous load/unload history has a 
signiﬁcant eﬀect on the subsequent behavior.  For e xample, the horizontal 
stress in an over-consolidated clay may be greater than the vertical stress. 
7.  Initialization.  This material model initializes each element with a  load/unload 
cycle under uniaxial vertical strain conditions.  T he element is loaded up to a 
vertical stress of |u1D7≠∆V,MAX  (deﬁned in Remark 6  above) and then unloaded to the 
user-deﬁned initial vertical stress |u1D7≠∆V, U SER  (see *INITIAL_STRESS_SOLID or 
*INITIAL_STRESS_DEPTH).  During this initialization  cycle, the stresses and 
history variables are updated using the same consti tutive behavior as during 
the main analysis.  Therefore, the horizontal stres s at the start of the analysis 
|u1D7≠∆H,ACT U AL  (as seen in the results ﬁles at time zero) is an o utput of the initializa- 
tion process and will be diﬀerent from the user-deﬁ ned initial horizontal stress 
|u1D7≠∆H,USER ; the latter is ignored.  Optionally, initializatio n may be switched to a 
load/unload/reload cycle (see input settings of THE ORY).  In this case, the 
element is loaded up to a vertical stress of |u1D7≠∆V,MAX , unloaded to a stress |u1D7≠∆V,MIN  
which is less than |u1D7≠∆V, U SER , and then reloaded to |u1D7≠∆V, U SER . The value of |u1D7≠∆V,MIN  is 
calculated automatically to try to minimize the diﬀ erence between |u1D7≠∆H,ACT U AL  
and |u1D7≠∆H,USER .  
8.  Material Subroutine Version.   This material model is developed for a 
Geotechnical FE program (Oasys Ltd.’s SAFE) written  by Arup.  The default 
THEORY = 0 gives a vectorized version ported from S AFE in the 1990’s.  Since 
then the material model has been developed further in SAFE, with versions 
ported to LS-DYNA in 2003 (THEORY = 4 and 104) and 2015 (THEORY = 204 
and 304); these are not vectorized and will run mor e slowly on most computer *
