  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
plastic strain curve for the highest value of strai n rate is used if 
the strain r ate exceeds the maximum value.  NOTE: The strain 
rate values deﬁned in the table may be given as the  natural 
logarithm of the strain rate.  If the ﬁrst  stress- strain curve in the 
table corresponds to a negative strain rate, LS-DY NA assumes 
that the natu ral logarithm of the strain rate value is used.  Si nce 
the tables are internally discretized to equally sp ace the points, 
natural logarithms are necessary, for example, if t he curves 
correspond to rates from 10 -4 to 10 4. 
BETA Hardening parameter, 0.0 < BETA < 1.0: 
EQ.0.0: pure kinematic hardening 
EQ.1.0: pure isotropic hardening 
0.0 < BETA < 1.0: mixed hardening 
FAIL Failure ﬂag: 
LT.0.0: user deﬁned failure subroutine is called to determi ne 
failure 
EQ.0.0: failure is not considered.  This option is recommended 
if failure is not of interest since many calculatio ns will 
be saved. 
GT.0.0: Plastic strain to failure.  When the plastic strain  reaches 
this value, the element is deleted from the calcula tion. *
