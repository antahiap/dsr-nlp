|u1D439|zeroCst Input parameter F0 on Card 3  (see Remark 3 )  
3.  Force Offset . The input parameter F0 oﬀsets the yield surface p arallel to the 
axial force axis.  It is the axial force at which t he maximum bending moment 
capacity occurs and is treated as tensile if F0 is positive, or compressive if F0 is 
negative.  The same axial force oﬀset F0 is used fo r both the local axes ( |u1D46≠ and |u1D461). 
For steel components, the value of F0 is usually ze ro.  For reinforced concrete 
components, F0 should be input as negative, corresp onding to the compressive 
axial force at which the moment capacities are maxi mum.

 as “fatigue-type” hysteretic behavior, where all pl astic cycles contribute to the 
degradation.  In the axial direction, plastic defor mation is accumulated sepa- 
rately for tensile and compressive deformations. 
If IHARD = 2, 3 or 4, the abscissa represents the p eak absolute value of the 
plastic deformation.  This quantity increases only when the absolute value of 
plastic deformation exceeds the previously recorded  maximum.  This option 
can be described as “high-tide” hardening behavior and follows the FEMA 
approach. In particular, IHARD of 3 and 4 reproduce  the yield-oriented and 
peak-oriented hysteresis, respectively, as shown be low. 
 
 
7.  Pinching.   Pinched-shape hysteresis loops are seen in experi ments on 
reinforced concrete members. They are caused by sti ﬀness changes due to 
cracks opening and closing.  This eﬀect on the ﬂexu re response may be simu- 
lated using input parameter PINM. The default, PINM  = 1.0, gives no pinch- 
ing.  The pinch points are given by moments and rot ations illustrated in the 
schematic below. Input parameter PINS has the same eﬀect on shear hysteresis IHARD = 2 IHARD = 3 IHARD = 4

 The force or moment for component |u1D46J|u1D46J , |u1D439|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.stactual , is calculated as:  
|u1D439|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.stactual = (1 − |u1D437|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst )(1 − |u1D437FEMA )|u1D439|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.st  nominal   . 
|u1D46J|u1D46J  can be AT for axial tension, AC for axial compress ion, MS for bending about 
the |u1D46≠-axis, MT for bending about the |u1D461-axis.  Here, |u1D439|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.stnominal  is the force or mo- 
ment calculated in the absence of damage for compon ent |u1D46J|u1D46J . |u1D437|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst  is the compo- 
nent-speciﬁc damage fraction for component xx , and |u1D437FEMA  is the damage 
calculated from passing FEMA thresholds (see Remark 11 ). 
The component-speciﬁc damage may be deﬁned to be de pendent on cumula- 
tive plastic deformation, on peak deformation, or a  combination of both:

 . 
Here |u1D714|oneCst|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst are |u1D714|twoCst|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst are the input parameters OMGxx1 and OMGxx2. ∆|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.stpea k  is 
the peak deformation (i.e., axial displacement, axi al strain or rotation depend- 
ing on xx  and IAX) that has occurred to date; ∆|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.staccum  is the accumulated plas- 
tic deformation; and ∆|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.stult  is the input parameter DUAT, DUAC, RUMS or 
RUMT. |u1D7≠6|oneCst and |u1D7≠6|twoCst are the input parameters LAM1 and LAM2. Setting th ese to 
zero disables dependence on peak deformation and cu mulative plastic defor- 
mation, respectively. 
The damage |u1D437FEMA  is calculated using input parameters SOFT1 and SOF T2, 
taking the most damaged component including shear a s well as axial and mo- 
ment components.  For example, if SOFT1 = 3 and SOF T2 = 4, and the most 
damaged component has reached a FEMA index of 3.25 (meaning one quarter 
of the way from threshold 3 to threshold 4), then |u1D437FEMA = 0.25 . 
By default, no element erosion occurs.  If SOFT1 an d SOFT2 are non-zero, then 
an element is deleted if |u1D437FEMA  reaches zero.  
10.  Shear Behavior.  Nonlinear shear behavior is controlled using input 
parameters LCSHS, LCSHT, SFSHS and SFSHT. By defaul t, the shear yield 
surface is independent of the yield surface for axi al and ﬂexure and takes the 
following form: 
/u1D̅1:|u1D46≠Cst= |parenleftCv6|u1D449|u1D46≠Cst
|u1D449|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst |parenriµhtCv6|twoCst
+ |parenleftCv6|u1D449|u1D461Cst
|u1D449|u1D466Cst|u1D461Cst |parenriµhtCv6|twoCst
− 1  . 
Here, |u1D449|u1D46≠Cst and |u1D449|u1D461Cst are the current shear forces in the local |u1D46≠- and |u1D461-directions. |u1D449|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst  
and |u1D449|u1D466Cst|u1D461Cst  are the current yield shear forces in the local |u1D46≠- and |u1D461-directions 
The shear yield forces are functions of plastic she ar strain (that is, shear angle). 
The plastic shear strain can be either peak or cumu lative, depending on *.
