This is  Material Type 202.  Tables and formulae from Euroco de 3 are used to derive the 
mechanical properties and their variation with temp erature, although these can be 
overridden by user-deﬁned curves.  It is currently available only for Hughes-Liu beam 
elements.  This material model is intended for mode lling structural steel in ﬁres.

speciﬁed (see *PART).

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
E Young’s modulus – a reasonable value must be provided even if 
LC_E is also input.  See Remark 2 . 
PR Poisson’s ratio 
SIGY Initial yield stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCst 
LC_E Optional load curve ID giving Young’s modulus as a function of 
temperature (overrides E and factors from EC3) 
LC_PR Optional load curve ID giving Poisson’s ratio as a function of 
temperature (overrides PR) 
LC_AL Optional load curve ID giving alpha as a function o f temperature 
(over-rides thermal expansion data from EC3) 
TBL_SS Optional table ID containing stress- strain curves at diﬀerent 
temperatures (overrides curves from EC3) 
LC_FS Optio nal load curve ID giving failure strain as a functi on of 
temperature 
Remarks: 
1.  Eurocode 3 and Required Input.   By default, only E, PR and SIGY must be 
deﬁned.  The Young’s Modulus, |u1D438, will be scaled by a factor which is a func- 
tion of temperature as speciﬁed in EC3. The factor is 1.0 at low temperature.  
Eurocode 3 (EC3) Section 3.2 speciﬁes the stress-st rain behaviour of carbon 
steels at temperatures between 20°C and 1200°C. The  stress-strain curves given 
in EC3 are scaled within the material model such th at the maximum stress at 
low temperatures is SIGY (see Figure below).  By de fault, the thermal expan- 
sion coeﬃcient as a function of temperature will be  as speciﬁed in EC3 Section 
3.4.1.1.  
2.  Optional Input.   LC_E, LC_PR and LC_AL are optional; they should h ave 
temperature on the |u1D46J-axis and the material property on the |u1D466-axis, with the 
points in order of increasing temperature.  If deﬁn ed (that is, nonzero), they 
over-ride E, PR, and the relationships from EC3. Ho wever, a reasonable value 
for E should always be included, since these values  will be used for purposes 
such as contact stiﬀness calculation. *
