This is Thermal Material Type 9.  With this materia l, temperature dependent isotropic 
properties with phase change can be deﬁned.  The la tent heat of the material is deﬁned 
together with the solid and liquid temperatures.  T he temperature dependency is 
deﬁned by specifying a minimum of two and a maximum  of eight data points.  The 
properties must be deﬁned for the temperature range  that the material will see in the 
analysis.
