 input parameters and underlying concepts may be fou nd in Simpson (1992), 
Lehane & Simpson (2000), and Ellison et al (2012).  The input parameters cor- 
respond to those described in Ellison et al as foll ows:

CAP /u1D̅01 
See Table 3 in Ellison et al for example input para meter values. 
2.  Elastic Stiffness.  The elastic bulk modulus is given by |u1D4JD′/u1Dℜ04⁄, where |u1D4JD′ is the 
current mean effective stress (compression positive ), and the small-strain 
elastic shear modulus is calculated from the bulk m odulus and Poisson’s ratio 
RNU.  
3.  Nonlinear Stress-Strain Response. The curve RLCID deﬁnes the nonlinear 
behavior in terms of secant stiffness degradation.  The same curve is assumed 
to apply to all six BRICK stress-strain components.   For example, shear in the 
|u1D46J /u1D46̅-plane will follow the curve, such that the |u1D46J-axis points correspond to shear 
angle |u1D6F∆|u1D46JCst|u1D467Cst , while the |u1D466-axis contains |u1D43A |u1D43Amax ⁄ , where |u1D43A is the secant stiﬀness 
(equal to /u1D̅0F|u1D46JCst|u1D467Cst |u1D6F∆|u1D46JCst|u1D467Cst ⁄) and |u1D43A|u1D4JACst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D46JCst  is the small-strain elastic shear modulus.  
4.  Model Requirements.   This material type requires that the model be ori ented 
such that the /u1D46̅-axis is deﬁned in the upward direction.  Compressi ve initial 
stress must be deﬁned, using, for example, *INITIAL _STRESS_SOLID or *INI-*.   
 platforms.  Nevertheless, the 2015 version is recom mended.  THEORY = 0, 4, 
and 104 are retained only for backward compatibilit y. 
9.  Shape Factor.   The shape factor for a typical soil would be 1.25 .  Do not use 
values higher than 1.35.  
10.  Anisotropy.   Anisotropy is treated by applying stretch factors  to the strain axis 
of the stress-strain curves for certain BRICK shear  components.  It may be de- 
ﬁned by either  using THEORY = 204 or 304 together with RVHHH on C ard 3b 
or  using THEORY = 7 or 107 with the parameters on Car d 3c.  Using THEO-
RY = 4 or 104 with non-zero anisotropy parameters o n Card 3a is permitted but 
not recommended.  See Ellison et al (2012) for desc ription of the anisotropy 
eﬀects modelled by THEORY = 7/107 and the meaning o f the parameters on 
Card 3c.  If anisotropy is not required, use THEORY  = 204 or 304 and leave 
Card 3b blank.  “Vertical” and “horizontal” are deﬁ ned in the global coordi- 
nate system with “vertical” being the global /u1D46̅-axis. 
11.  TOL and SUBINC.   These parameters usually have little inﬂuence on the 
result.  Smaller values may sometimes improve accur acy, at cost of greater run 
times.  
12.  Creep.  Creep is implemented by scaling the strain “string  lengths” (see RL-
CID) as a function of strain rate: 
|u1D446 = SLRATIO × |u1D446RLCID |<racketleftCvJ1 + BETAC ×/u1D45∫|u1D4JB |parenleftCvJ||u1D7≠≠̇|
|u1D7≠≠̇ref + 1|parenriµhtCvJ |<racketriµhtCvJ 
Where  |u1D446 is string length; |u1D446|u1D44JCst|u1D43FCst /u1D4:6.st/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:̅.st  are the string lengths in the curve RLCID; 
SLRATIO and BETAC are input parameters on Card 4; ||u1D7≠≠̇| is strain rate; and |u1D7≠≠̇ref  
is input parameter EPSDOT1 or EPSDOT2 for volumetri c and shear strains, 
respectively.  Note that SLRATIO × |u1D446RLCID  gives the string lengths for zero 
strain rate.
