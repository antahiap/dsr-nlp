CID/LCSS can be either a curve or table deﬁning eﬀe ctive stress as a function of 
eﬀective plastic strain. 
 
Creep (LAW = 5) 
 
For creep, the inelastic strain is represented by t he creep strain, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J≠Cst. The evolution 
depends on the model speciﬁed.

Figure M24-1.  Rate eﬀects may be accounted for by deﬁning a table of  curves.  If a 
table ID is speciﬁed, a curve ID is given for each strai n rate; see *DEFINE_TABLE.  
Intermediate values are found by interpolating between curves.  Eﬀective plastic 
strain as a functi on of yield stress is expected.  If the strain rate val ues fall out of 
range, extrapolation is not used; rather, either the ﬁrst  or last curve determines the 
yield stress depending on whether the rate is low or high, resp ectively. *. LINEAR_PLASTICITY  
2-246 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
Multi-Dimensional Tables.   With VP = 3, yield stress can be a 
function of plastic strain, strain rate, and up to seven history 
variables (see Remark 4 ). That means LCSS can refer to *DE-
FINE_TABLE_ XD or *DEFINE_TABLE_COM PACT up to a level 
of 9. 
LCSR Load curve ID deﬁning strain rate scaling eﬀect on yield stress.  If 
LC SR is negative, the load curve is evaluated using a  binary 
search for the corre ct interval for the strain rate.  The binary 
search is slower than the default incremental searc h, but in cases 
where large changes in the strain rate may occur ov er a single 
time step, it is more robust.  This option is not n ecessary for the 
viscoplastic formulation.  
VP Formulation for rate eﬀects: 
EQ.-1.0: Cowper- Symonds with eﬀective deviatoric strain rate 
rather than total 
EQ.0.0: Scale yield stress (default) 
EQ.1.0: Viscoplastic formulation 
EQ.3.0: Same as VP = 0, but with ﬁltered eﬀective total strain 
rates (see Remark 3 ) 
EPS1 - EPS8 Eﬀective plastic strain values (optional).  If used , at least 2 points 
should be deﬁned.  The ﬁrst point must be zero corresponding to 
the initial yield stress.  WARN ING: If the ﬁrst point is nonzero, 
the yield stress is extrapolated to determine the i nitial yield.  If 
this option is used, SIGY and ETAN are ignored and may be 
input as zero. 
ES1 - ES8 Corresponding yield stress values to EPS1  - EPS8 
Remarks: 
1.  Stress-Strain Behavior.   The stress-strain behavior may be treated by a 
bilinear stress strain curve by deﬁning the tangent  modulus, ETAN.  Alternate- 
ly, a curve of eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀe ctive plastic strain similar to 
that shown in Figure M10-1  may be deﬁned by (EPS1, ES1) - (EPS8, ES8); how- 
ever, a curve ID (LCSS) may be referenced instead i f eight points are insuﬃ- 
cient.  The cost is roughly the same for either app roach.  Note that in the 
special case of uniaxial stress, true stress as a f unction of true plastic strain is *. LINEAR_PLASTICITY  
2-248 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 can now be ﬁltered with the help of ﬁeld C (not Cow per-Symonds in this case) 
and the following exponential moving average equati on: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCsta v g = C × |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst−|oneCsta v g + (1 − C) × |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst  
This might be helpful if a table LCSS with crossing  yield curves is used. 
4.  Yield Stress Depending on History Variables.   When VP = 3, the yield stress 
deﬁned with LCSS can depend on up to seven history variables through a mul- 
ti-dimensional table.  These seven history variable s are history variables 6 
through 12 which you will have to set using *INITIA L_HISTORY_NODE or 
*INITIAL_STRESS_SOLID/SHELL and whose meanings are,  therefore, deter- 
mined by you.  For instance, you can set the values  of history variables 6, 9, 
and 10 for certain nodes and have the value of yiel d stress depend upon histo- 
ry variables 6, 9, and 10. Note that these history variables are only initialized 
and do not evolve in time.  See *DEFINE_TABLE_ XD or *DEFINE_TABLE_-
COMPACT for more details. 
5.  Implicit Calculations.   For implicit calculations with this material invo lving 
severe nonlinear hardening, the radial return metho d may result in inaccurate 
stress-strain response.  Setting IACC = 1 on *CONTR OL_ACCURACY acti- 
vates a fully iterative plasticity algorithm, which  will remedy this.  This is not 
to be confused with the MITER ﬂag on *CONTROL_SHELL  which governs the 
treatment of the plane stress assumption for shell elements.  If failure is ap- 
plied with this option, incident failure will initi ate damage, and the stress will 
continuously degrade to zero before erosion for a d eformation of 1% plastic 
strain.  So for instance, if the failure strain is FAIL = 0.05 , then the element is 
eroded when |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.06  and the material goes from intact to completely da m- 
aged between |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.05  and |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.06 . The reason is to enhance implicit per- 
formance by maintaining continuity in the internal forces. 
6.  Failure Output.   For a nonzero failure strain, *DEFINE_MATERIAL_HI STO-
RIES can be used to output the failure indicator.

7.  LCSS Rediscretization.   In the special case where LCSS is a *DEFINE_-
CURVE, LCSS is not rediscretized (see LCINT in *DEF INE_CURVE). *. LINEAR_PLASTICITY.  First, the  yield function for 
plane stress does not include the transverse shear stress components which are 
updated elastically, and, secondly, this model is a lways fully iterative.  Conse-

Available options include:

LOG_INTERPOLATION 
PRESTRAIN (for shells only)  
RATE 
RTCL 
STOCHASTIC (for shells only)  
The LOG_INTERPOLATION keyword option interpolates t he strain rate eﬀect in table 
LCSS with logarithmic interpolation.  
The PRESTRAIN option is used to include prestrain w hen checking for major strain 
failure.  The RATE option is used to account for ra te dependence of thinning failure or 
to invoke viscoelasticiy (LCEMOD).  The RTCL option  is used to activate RTCL damage 
(see Remark 1).  One additional card is needed with  any of these options.   
The STOCHASTIC keyword option allows spatially vary ing yield and failure behavior.  
See *DEFINE_STOCHASTIC_VARIATION for additional inf ormation.

This is Material Type 255, an isotropic elastoplast ic material with thermal properties.  It 
can be used for both explicit and implicit analyses .  Young’s modulus and Poisson’s 
ratio can depend on the temperature by deﬁning two load curves.  Moreover, the yield 
stress in tension and compression are given as load  curves for diﬀerent temperatures by 
using two tables.  The thermal coeﬃcient of expansi on can be given as a constant AL-
PHA or as a load curve LALPHA. A positive curve ID for LALPHA models the 
instantaneous thermal coeﬃcient, whereas a negative s curve ID models the thermal 
coeﬃcient relative to a reference temperature, TREF .  The strain rate eﬀects are 
modelled with the Cowper-Symonds rate model with th e parameters C and P on
