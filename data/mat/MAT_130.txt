 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
YS Yield stress.  This parameter is optional and appro ximates the 
yield condition.  Set to zero if the behavior is el astic.

Because this is a resultant formulation, nothing is  written to the six stress slots of d3plot .  
Resultant forces and moments may be written to elout  and to dynain  in place of the six 
stresses.   The ﬁrst two extra history variables ma y be used to complete output of the 
eight resultants to elout  and dynain .*
