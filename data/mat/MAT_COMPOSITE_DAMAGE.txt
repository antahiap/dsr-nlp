KFAIL Bulk modulus of failed material.  Necessary for com pressive 
failure. 
AOPT Material axes option (see MAT _OPTION TROPIC_ELASTIC for a 
more complete description): 
EQ.0.0: locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes 1, 2, and 4, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_ NODES, and then, for shells only, rotated about 
the shell element normal by an angle BETA.  
EQ.1.0: locally orthotropic with material axes det ermined by a 
point in space and the global location of the eleme nt 
center; this is the |u1D44∆-direction.  This option is for solid 
elements only. 
EQ.2.0: globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR. 
EQ.3.0: locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector, /u1D42F, with the 
element normal. 
EQ.4.0: locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector, /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D4JD, which deﬁne the centerline axis.  
This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: the absolute value of AOPT is a c oordinate system ID 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR). *.

2.  The ATRACK Field.   The initial material directions are set using AOP T and the 
related data.  By default, the material directions in shell elements are updated 
each cycle based on the rotation of the 1-2 edge, o r else the rotation of all edges 
if the invariant node numbering option is set on *C ONTROL_ACCURACY.  
When ATRACK = 1, an optional scheme is used in whic h the |u1D44∆-direction of the 
material tracks element deformation as well as rota tion. 
At the start of the calculation, a line is passed t hrough each element center in 
the direction of the material |u1D44∆-axis.  This line will intersect the edges of the e l- 
ement at two points.  The referential coordinates o f these two points are stored 
and then used throughout the calculation to locate these points in the de- 
formed geometry.  The material |u1D44∆-axis is assumed to be in the direction of the 
line that passes through both points.  If ATRACK = 0, the layers of a layered 
composite will always rotate together.  However, if  ATRACK = 1, the layers 
 
4  ranges over the shell integration points. *. . 
2.  Computing Stresses.  The stress versus stretch curves LCIDA, LCIDB, LCI DC, 
LCIDAB, LCIDBC, and LCIDCA are only used to obtain the slope (stiﬀness) to 
ﬁll up the |C| matrix and are not used directly to compute the st resses.  The 
stresses are computed using the |C| matrix and the Green-St Venant strain ten- 
sor. *
