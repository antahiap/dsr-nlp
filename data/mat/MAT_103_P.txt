  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
S12 Yield stress in local -direction.  This input is ignored if 
(|u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst ,|u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst ,|u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst )>0. 
AOPT Material axes option (see MAT _OPTION TROPIC_ELASTIC for a 
more complete description): 
EQ.0.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes 1, 2, and 4, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_NODES, and then rotated about the shell ele- 
ment normal by an angle BETA. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR. 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector v with th e 
element normal. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VEC TOR).  Available in R3 version of 971 
and later. 
XP, YP, ZP |u1D46J|u1D4JDCst, |u1D466|u1D4JDCst, /u1D46̅|u1D4JDCst deﬁne coordinates of point /u1D42∫ for AOPT = 1 and 4. 
A1, A2, A3 |u1D44∆|oneCst, |u1D44∆|twoCst, |u1D44∆|threeCst deﬁne components of vector /u1D41A for AOPT = 2. 
D1, D2, D3 |u1D4J1|oneCst, |u1D4J1|twoCst, |u1D4J1|threeCst deﬁne components of vector /u1D41D for AOPT = 2. 
V1, V2, V3 |u1D463|oneCst, |u1D463|twoCst, |u1D463|threeCst deﬁne components of vector /u1D42F for AOPT = 3 and 4. 
BETA Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 0 and 3, may be overridden 
on the element card, see *ELEMENT_SHELL_BETA. 
Remarks: 
If no load curve is deﬁned for the eﬀective stress versus eﬀective plastic strain, the 
uniaxial stress-strain curve is given on the follow ing form 
|u1D7≠∆(|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst) = |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D444|u1D4JFCst|oneCst/˙racketleft.v21 − exp|parenleftCv2−|u1D436|u1D4JFCst|oneCst|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2/˙racketright.v2+ |u1D444|u1D4JFCst|twoCst/˙racketleft.v21 − exp|parenleftCv2−|u1D436|u1D4JFCst|twoCst|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2/˙racketright.v2 *. ).  
Also, brittle orthotropic failure based on a phenom enological Tsai-Wu or Tsai-Hill 
criterion can be deﬁned.
