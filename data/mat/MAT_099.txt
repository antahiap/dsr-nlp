NUMINT Number of through thickness integration points whic h must fail 
before the element is deleted.  If zero, all points  must fail.  The 
default of all integration points is not recommende d since 
elements undergoing large st rain are often not deleted due to 
nodal ﬁber rotations which limit 0 strains at activ e integration 
points after most points have failed.  Better resul ts are obtained if 
NU MINT is set to 1 or a number less than one half of the number 
of through thickness points.  For example, if four through 
thickness points are used, NU MINT should not exceed 2, even for 
fully integrated shells which have 16 integration p oints.
