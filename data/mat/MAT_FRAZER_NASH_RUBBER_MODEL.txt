2-282 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
ST Specimen thickness; see Figure M27-1 . 
LCID Load curve ID (see DEFINE_CURVE) giving the fo rce as a 
function of actual change in gauge length.  See als o Figure M27-2
for an alternative deﬁnition. 
Remarks: 
The constants can be deﬁned directly or a least squ ares ﬁt can be performed if the 
uniaxial data (SGL, SW, ST and LCID) is available.  If a least squares ﬁt is chosen, then the 
terms to be included in the energy functional are ﬂ agged by setting their corresponding 
coeﬃcients to unity.   If all coeﬃcients are zero, the default is to use  only the terms 
involving /u1D4:C|oneCst and /u1D4:C|twoCst.  |u1D436|oneCst|zeroCst|zeroCst  defaults to unity if the least square ﬁt is used. 
 
The strain energy functional, U, is deﬁned in terms  of the input constants as: 
/u1D448= |u1D436|oneCst|zeroCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|oneCst+ |u1D436|twoCst|zeroCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|oneCst|twoCst+ |u1D436|threeCst|zeroCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|oneCst|threeCst+ |u1D436|fourCst|zeroCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|oneCst|fourCst+ |u1D436|oneCst|oneCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|oneCst/u1D4:C|twoCst+ |u1D436|twoCst|oneCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|oneCst|twoCst/u1D4:C|twoCst+ |u1D436|zeroCst|oneCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|twoCst+ |u1D436|zeroCst|twoCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|twoCst|twoCst+ |u1D4J3 (/u1D4:D)  , 
where the invariants can be expressed in terms of t he deformation gradient matrix, |u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , 
and the Green-St.  Venant strain tensor,  |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst : 
/u1D4:D=|dividesCv2|u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |dividesCv2
/u1D4:C|oneCst= |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J6Cst 
/u1D4:C|twoCst=1

The derivative of /u1D448 with respect to a component of strain gives the co rresponding 
component of stress 
|u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =∂/u1D448
∂|u1D438|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   . 
Here, |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  is the second Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress tensor. 
 
The load curve deﬁnition that provides the uniaxial  data should give the change in 
gauge length, ∆/u1D4:F, and the corresponding force.  In compression both  the force and the 
change in gauge length must be speciﬁed as negative  values.  In tension the force and 
change in gauge length should be input as positive values.  The principal stretch ratio in 
the uniaxial direction, |u1D7≠6|oneCst, is then given by 
|u1D7≠6 =/u1D4:F/u1D45C.st+ ∆/u1D4:F
/u1D4:F/u1D45C.st 
Alternatively, the stress as a function of strain c urve can also be input by setting the 
gauge length, thickness, and width to unity and deﬁ ning the engineering strain in place 
of the change in gauge length and the nominal (engi neering) stress in place of the force; *
