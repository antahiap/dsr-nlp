This is  Material Type 232.  This is a Biot linear hystereti c material, to be used for 
modeling the nearly-frequency-independent viscoelas tic behavior of soils subjected to 
cyclic loading, such as in soil-structure interacti on analysis [Spanos and Tsavachidis 
(2001), Makris and Zhang (2000), Muscolini, Palmeri  and Ricciardelli (2005)].  The 
hysteretic damping coeﬃcient for the model is compu ted from a prescribed damping 
ratio by calibrating with an equivalent viscous dam ping model for a single-degree-of-
freedom system.  The damping increases the stiﬀness  of the model and thus reduces the 
computed time-step size.

Remarks: 
1.  Stress.   The stress is computed as a function of the strai n rate as 
|u1D7≠∆(|u1D461) =/integral.v:|u1D436|u1D44JCst(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D7≠≠̇(/u1D̅0F)|u1D461Cst
|zeroCst|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F  
where *.   
 |u1D436|u1D44JCst(|u1D461) = |u1D436 |<racketleftCvJ1 +2|u1D7≠2
/u1D̅0B|u1D438|oneCst|parenleftCv1|u1D6FD|u1D461|parenriµhtCv1|<racketriµhtCvJ . 
In the above, |u1D436 is the elastic isotropic constitutive tensor, |u1D7≠2 is the hysteretic 
damping factor, and |u1D6FD = 2/u1D̅0B|u1D4J3/u1D451.st/10 , where |u1D4J3/u1D451.st is the dominant excitation frequen- 
cy in Hz.  The function |u1D438|oneCst is given by 
|u1D438|oneCst(|u1D46≠) =/integral.v:e−/u1Dℜ09.st
/u1D̅0∫|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0∫∞
|u1D46≠Cst 
For eﬃcient implementation, this function is approx imated by a 5-term Prony 
series as 
|u1D438|oneCst(|u1D46≠) ≈ |summationCv1 |u1D44F|u1D4J8Cste|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J8Csts|u1D46≠Cst|fiveCst
|u1D4J8Cst=|oneCst , 
such that |u1D44F|u1D4J8Cst> 0. 
2.  Hysteretic Damping Factor.   The hysteretic damping factor |u1D7≠2 is obtained 
from the prescribed damping ratio /u1Dℜ0D as  
|u1D7≠2 =/u1D̅0B /u1Dℜ0D/atan(10) = 2.14 /u1Dℜ0D 
by assuming that, for a single degree-of-freedom sy stem, the energy dissipated 
per cycle by the hysteretic material is the same as  that by a viscous damper, if 
the excitation frequency matches the natural freque ncy of the system. 
3.  Young’s Modulus.   The consistent Young’s modulus for this model is given by  
|u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst= |u1D438|<racketleftCvJ1 +2|u1D7≠2
/u1D̅0B|u1D4J4|<racketriµhtCvJ  , 
where 
|u1D4J4 = |summationCv1 |u1D44F|u1D4J8Cst1
|u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D6FD∆|u1D461|u1D4JBCst|<racketleftCv1exp|parenleftCv1|u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D6FD∆|u1D461|u1D4JBCst|parenriµhtCv1 − 1|<racketriµhtCv1|fiveCst
|u1D4J8Cst=|oneCst  . 
Because |u1D4J4 > 0 , the computed element time-step size is smaller th an that for the 
corresponding elastic element.  Furthermore, the ti me-step size computed at 
any time depends on the previous time-step size.  I t can be demonstrated that 
the new computed time-step size stays within a narr ow range of the previous 
time-step size and for a uniform mesh, converges to  a constant value.  For |u1D4J3/u1D451.st=
3.25 Hz and /u1Dℜ0D= 0.05 , the percentage decrease in time-step size can be expected 
to be about 12 - 15% for initial time-step sizes of  less than 0.02 secs, and about 
7 - 10% for initial time-step sizes larger than 0.0 2 secs.
