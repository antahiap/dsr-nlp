Material Models: 
The unidirectional and fabric layer failure criteri a and the associated property 
degradation models for material 161 are described a s follows.  All the failure criteria are 
expressed in terms of stress components based on pl y level stresses 
(|u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst,/u1D̅0F|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst ,/u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst ,/u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst ) and the associated elastic moduli are (|u1D438|u1D44∆Cst, |u1D438|u1D44FCst, |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst, |u1D43A|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst , |u1D43A|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst , |u1D43A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst ).  
Note that for the unidirectional model, |u1D44∆, |u1D44F and /u1D450 denote the ﬁber, in-plane transverse *. -162  
 |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst = |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst (|zeroCst)+ tan(/u1Dℜ11)⟨−|u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst⟩
|u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst |minuteCst= |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst)+ tan(/u1Dℜ11)⟨−|u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst⟩
|u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst = |u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst (|zeroCst)+ tan(/u1Dℜ11)⟨−|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst⟩
|u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst /•uoteℂbl.st= |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst)+ tan(/u1Dℜ11)⟨−|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst⟩ 
where ϕ is a material constant as tan(/u1Dℜ11) is similar to the coeﬃcient of friction, and |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst (|zeroCst), 
|u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst (|zeroCst)and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst)are the shear strength values of the corresponding tensile modes. 
 
Failure predicted by the criterion of |u1D4J3|fourCst can be referred to as transverse matrix failure, 
while the matrix failure predicted by |u1D4J3|fiveCst, which is parallel to the layer, can be referred a s 
the delamination mode when it occurs within the ele ments that are adjacent to the ply 
interface.  Note that a scale factor |u1D446 is introduced to provide better correlation of 
delamination area with experiments.  The scale fact or |u1D446 can be determined by ﬁtting the 
analytical prediction to experimental data for the delamination area. 
 
When ﬁber failure in tension/shear mode is predicte d in a layer by |u1D4J3|oneCst, the load carrying 
capacity of that layer is completely eliminated.  A ll the stress components are reduced 
to zero instantaneously (100 time steps to avoid nu merical instability).  For compressive 
ﬁber failure, the layer is assumed to carry a resid ual axial load, while the transverse 
load carrying capacity is reduced to zero.  When th e ﬁber compressive failure mode is 
reached due to |u1D4J3|twoCst, the axial layer compressive strength stress is as sumed to reduce to a 
residual value |u1D446|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  (= SFFC × |u1D446|u1D434Cst /u1D4:6.st ).  The axial stress is then assumed to remain cons tant, 
meaning |u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst =  −|u1D446|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st , for continuous compressive loading, while the sub sequent 
unloading curve follows a reduced axial modulus to zero axial stress and strain state.  
When the ﬁber crush failure occurs, the material is  assumed to behave elastically for 
compressive pressure, |u1D4JD > 0 , and to carry no load for tensile pressure, |u1D4JD < 0 . 
 
When a matrix failure (delamination) in the |u1D44∆|u1D44F -plane is predicted, the strength values 
for |u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst (|zeroCst)and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst) are set to zero.  This results in reducing the str ess components |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst, /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  
and /u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst  to the fractured material strength surface.  For te nsile mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst> 0, these stress 
components are reduced to zero.  For compressive mo de, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst< 0, the normal stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst is 
assumed to deform elastically for the closed matrix  crack.  Loading on the failure 
envelop, the shear stresses are assumed to ‘slide’ on the fractured strength surface 
(frictional shear stresses) like in an ideal plasti c material, while the subsequent 
unloading shear stress-strain path follows reduced shear moduli to the zero shear stress 
and strain state for both /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  and /u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst  components. 
 
The post failure behavior for the matrix crack in t he a-c plane due to |u1D4J3|fourCst is modeled in the 
same fashion as that in the |u1D44∆|u1D44F -plane as described above.  In this case, when fail ure 
occurs, |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst (|zeroCst) and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst)are reduced to zero instantaneously.  The post frac ture response is 
then governed by failure criterion of |u1D4J3|fiveCst with |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst (|zeroCst)= 0 and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst)= 0.  For tensile mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst>
0, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst, /u1D̅0F|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst  and /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  are zero.  For compressive mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst< 0, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst is assumed to be elastic, 
while /u1D̅0F|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst  and /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  ‘slide’ on the fracture strength surface as in an ideal plastic material, *. -162  
 Another failure mode, which is due to the quadratic  interaction between the thickness 
stresses, is expected to be mainly a matrix failure .  This through the thickness matrix 
failure criterion is 
|u1D4J3|oneCst|twoCst  =  |u1D446|twoCst/˙raceleft.v6|parenleftCvJ⟨|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst⟩
|u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D447Cst |parenriµhtCvJ|twoCst 
+ |parenleftCvJ/u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst 
|u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst |parenriµhtCvJ|twoCst
+ |parenleftCvJ/u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst 
|u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst |parenriµhtCvJ|twoCst
/˙raceright.v6− 1 = 0  , 
where |u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D447Cst  is the through the thickness tensile strength, and  |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  and |u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst  are the shear 
strengths assumed to depend on the compressive norm al stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst, meaning 
|<raceleftCvJ|u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst 
|u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst |<raceriµhtCvJ =/˙raceleft.v6|u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst (|zeroCst)
|u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst)/˙raceright.v6+ tan|parenleftCv1/u1Dℜ11|parenriµhtCv1⟨−|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst⟩ . 
When failure predicted by this criterion occurs wit hin elements that are adjacent to the 
ply interface, the failure plane is expected to be parallel to the layering planes, and, 
thus, can be referred to as the delamination mode.  Note that a scale factor |u1D446 is 
introduced to provide better correlation of delamin ation area with experiments.  The 
scale factor |u1D446 can be determined by ﬁtting the analytical predict ion to experimental data 
for the delamination area. 
 
Similar to the unidirectional model, when ﬁber tens ile/shear failure is predicted in a 
layer by |u1D4J3|sixCst or |u1D4J3|sevenCst, the load carrying capacity of that layer in the a ssociated direction is 
completely eliminated.  For compressive ﬁber failur e due to by |u1D4J3/eight.st or |u1D4J3/nine.st, the layer is 
assumed to carry a residual axial load in the faile d direction, while the load carrying 
capacity transverse to the failed direction is assu med unchanged.  When the 
compressive axial stress in a layer reaches the com pressive axial strength |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst /u1D4:6.st  or |u1D446|u1D44FCst /u1D4:6.st , the 
axial layer stress is assumed to be reduced to the residual strength |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  or |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  where 
|u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  =  SFFC × |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst /u1D4:6.st  and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  =  SFFC × |u1D446|u1D44FCst /u1D4:6.st .  The axial stress is assumed to remain 
constant, that is, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst =  −|u1D446|u1D44∆Cst /u1D4:6.st |u1D44JCst  or |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst =  −|u1D446|u1D44FCst /u1D4:6.st |u1D44JCst , for continuous compressive loading, 
while the subsequent unloading curve follows a redu ced axial modulus.  When the ﬁber 
crush failure is occurred, the material is assumed to behave elastically for compressive 
pressure, |u1D4JD > 0 , and to carry no load for tensile pressure,  |u1D4JD < 0 . 
 
When the in-plane matrix shear failure is predicted  by |u1D4J3|oneCst|oneCst  the axial load carrying 
capacity within a failed element is assumed unchang ed, while the in-plane shear stress 
is assumed to be reduced to zero. 
 
For through the thickness matrix (delamination) fai lure given by equation |u1D4J3|oneCst|twoCst , the in-
plane load carrying capacity within the element is assumed to be elastic, while the 
strength values for the tensile mode, |u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst (|zeroCst) and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst), are set to zero.  For tensile mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst>
0, the through the thickness stress components are r educed to zero.  For compressive 
mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst< 0, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst is assumed to be elastic, while /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  and /u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst  ‘slide’ on the fracture 
strength surface as in an ideal plastic material, a nd the unloading path follows reduced 
shear moduli to the zero shear stress and strain st ate.

Element Erosion: 
A failed element is eroded in any of three diﬀerent  ways: 
1.  If ﬁber tensile failure in a unidirectional layer is predicted in the element and 
the axial tensile strain is greater than E_LIMT.  F or a fabric layer, both in-plane 
directions are failed and exceed E_LIMT. 
2.  If compressive relative volume in a failed element  is smaller than ECRSH. 
3.  If tensile relative volume in a failed element is greater than EEXPN.
