LS-DYNA R13 2-415 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCID Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_CURVE) or tab le ID deﬁning the 
nominal stress as a function of nominal strain.  If  a table is used, a 
family of curves is deﬁned each corresponding to a discrete 
temperature; see *DEFINE_TABLE. 
TC Cut-oﬀ for the nominal tensile stress, /u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst. 
HU Hysteretic unloading factor between 0.0 and 1.0 (default = 1.0, 
that is, no energy dissipation); see also Figure M57-1 . 
BETA Decay constant to model creep in unloading, |u1D6FD. 
DAMP Viscous coeﬃcient (.05 < recommended value < .50) to model 
damping eﬀects. 
LT.0.0:  |DAMP|  is the load curve ID, which deﬁnes the 
damping constant as a function of the maximum strai n 
in compression deﬁned as: 
|u1D7≠≠|mCst|aCst|xCst = max(1 − |u1D7≠6|oneCst, 1 − |u1D7≠6|twoCst, 1. −|u1D7≠6|threeCst) . 
In tension, the damping constant is set to the valu e cor- 
responding to the strain at 0.0. The abscissa shoul d be 
deﬁned from 0.0 to 1.0. 
SHAPE Shape factor for unloading.  Active for nonzero val ues of the 
hysteretic unloading factor.  Values less than one reduces the 
energy dissipation and greater than one increases d issipation; see 
also Figure M57-1 . 
FAIL Failure option after cutoﬀ stress is reached: 
EQ.0.0:  tensile stress remains at cut-oﬀ value. 
EQ.1.0:  tensile stress is reset to zero. 
BVFLAG Bulk viscosity activation ﬂag: 
EQ.0.0:  no bulk viscosity (recommended) 
EQ.1.0:  bulk viscosity active 
ED Optional Young's relaxation modulus, |u1D438/u1D451.st, for rate eﬀects.   
BETA1 Optional decay constant, |u1D6FD|oneCst. *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-417 (MAT) for the eigenvalues of the left stretch tensor, |u1D449|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , which is obtained using a polar 
decomposition of the deformation gradient matrix, |u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst .  Recall that,  
|u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D44J|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J8Cst /u1D448|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D449|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J8Cst |u1D44J|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
The update of |u1D449|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  follows the numerically stable approach of Taylor and Flanagan 
[1989].  After solving for the principal stretches,  we compute the elongations and, if the 
elongations are compressive, the corresponding valu es of the nominal stresses, /u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst are 
interpolated.  If the elongations are tensile, the nominal stresses are given by 
/u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D438|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst 
and the Cauchy stresses in the principal system bec ome 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst=/u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst
|u1D7≠6|u1D4J7Cst|u1D7≠6|u1D4J8Cst  . 
The stresses can now be transformed back into the g lobal system for the nodal force 
calculations. 
Remarks: 
1.  Decay Constant and Hysteretic Unloading.  When hysteretic unloading is 
used the reloading will follow the unloading curve if the decay constant, |u1D6FD, is 
set to zero.  If |u1D6FD is nonzero the decay to the original loading curve  is governed 
by the expression: 
1 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st |u1D461Cst   . 
2.  Bulk Viscosity.   The bulk viscosity, which generates a rate depend ent 
pressure, may cause an unexpected volumetric respon se and, consequently, it 
is optional with this model. 
3.  Hysteretic Unloading Factor.   The hysteretic unloading factor results in the 
unloading curve to lie beneath the loading curve as  shown in Figure M57-1  
This unloading provides energy dissipation which is  reasonable in certain 
kinds of foam. 
4.  Output.   Note that since this material has no eﬀective pla stic strain, the internal 
energy per initial volume is written into the outpu t databases. 
5.  Rate Effects.   Rate eﬀects are accounted for through linear visc oelasticity by a 
convolution integral of the form

∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F   , 
where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) is the relaxation function.  The stress tensor, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JFCst, augments the 
stresses determined from the foam, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D45:.st; consequently, the ﬁnal stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , is 
taken as the summation of the two contributions: *
