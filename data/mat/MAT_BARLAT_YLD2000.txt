  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
BETA Hardening parameter.  Any value ranging from 0 (iso tropic 
hardening) to 1 (kinematic hardening) may be input.   This ﬁeld is 
ignored if the ﬂow potential exponent A is input as  a negative 
number.  
ITER Plastic iteration ﬂag: 
EQ.0.0: Plane stress algorithm for stress return 
EQ.1.0: Secant iteration algorithm for stress return 
ITER provides an option of using three secant itera tions for 
determining the thickness strain increment as exper iments have 
shown  that this leads to a more accurate prediction of s he ll 
thickness changes for rapid processes.  A significa nt increase in 
computation time is incurred with this option so it  should be used 
only for applications associated with high rates of  loading and/or 
for implicit analysis. 
ISCALE Yield locus scaling ﬂag: 
EQ.0.0: Scaling on - reference direction is the rolling direction 
(default) 
EQ.1.0: Scaling oﬀ – reference direction arbitrary

3.  Kinematic Hardening Model.   A kinematic hardening model is implemented 
following the works of Chaboche and Roussilier.  A back stress, /u1D6C2, is intro- 
duced such that the eﬀective stress is computed as 
|u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st= |u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst − 2|u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst , |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst − 2|u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst , |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|twoCst ) . 
The back stress is the sum of up to four terms acco rding to 
|u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J8Cst|fourCst
|u1D4J8Cst=|oneCst  , 
and the evolution of each back stress component is as follows 
|u1D6FF|u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J8Cst= |u1D436|u1D4J8Cst|parenleftCvJ|u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst − |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst

where |u1D436|u1D4J8Cst and |u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst are material parameters, |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  is the deviatoric stress tensor, |u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st 
is the eﬀective stress and |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain.  The yield conditi on

in order to get the expected stress strain response  for uniaxial stress. 
4.  Hansel Hardening Law.   The Hansel hardening law is the same as in materi al 
113 but is repeated here for the sake of convenienc e.  
The hardening is temperature dependent and therefor e this material model 
must be run either in a coupled thermo-mechanical s olution, using prescribed 
temperatures or using the adiabatic temperature cal culation option.  Setting the 
parameter CP to the speciﬁc heat Cp of the material activates the adiabatic tem- 
perature calculation that calculates the temperatur e rate from the equation  
|u1D447̇= |summationCv1|u1D7≠∆/u1D422/u1D423|u1D437|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /p.st
|u1D7≠+|u1D436|u1D4JDCst |u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J7Cst  , 
where /u1D6D4:/u1D40:|u1D4JDCst (the numerator) is the plastically dissipated heat .  Using the Kelvin 
scale is recommended, even though other scales may be used without prob- 
lems. *.   
 5.  Heat Treatment.   Heat treatment for increasing the formability of prestrained 
aluminum sheets can be simulated through the use of  HTFLAG, where the 
intention is to run a forming simulation in steps i nvolving preforming, spring- 
back, heat treatment, and postforming.  In each ste p the history is transferred 
to the next using a dynain  ﬁle (see *INTERFACE_SPRINGBACK).  The ﬁrst two 
steps are performed with HTFLAG = 0 according to st andard procedures, re- 
sulting in a plastic strain ﬁeld |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst corresponding to the prestrain.  The heat 
treatment step is performed using HTFLAG = 1 in a c oupled thermomechani- 
cal simulation, where the blank is heated.  The cou pling between thermal and 
mechanical processes is only through the maximum te mperature |u1D447|zeroCst being 
stored as a history variable in the material model,  corresponding to the heat 
treatment temperature.  Here it is important to exp ort all history variables to 
the dynain  ﬁle for the postforming step.  In the ﬁnal postfor ming step, HT-
FLAG = 2, the yield stress is then augmented by the  Hocket-Sherby like term 
∆|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D44F − (|u1D44F − |u1D44∆)exp |<racketleftCv4− /u1D450|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst− |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv2/u1D451.st|<racketriµhtCv4 , 
where |u1D44∆, |u1D44F, /u1D450, and |u1D4J1 are given as tables as functions of the heat treatm ent tem- 
perature |u1D447|zeroCst and prestrain |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst. That is, in the table deﬁnitions each load curve 
corresponds to a given prestrain and the load curve  value is with respect to the 
heat treatment temperature, 
|u1D44∆ = |u1D44∆|parenleftCv2|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv2  , |u1D44F = |u1D44F|parenleftCv2|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv2  ,/u1D450=/u1D450|parenleftCv2|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv2  , |u1D4J1 = |u1D4J1(|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst)     
The eﬀect of heat treatment is that the material st rength decreases but harden- 
ing increases, thus typically, 
|u1D44∆ ≤ 0  , |u1D44F ≥ |u1D44∆  , /u1D450> 0  , |u1D4J1 > 0  .*
