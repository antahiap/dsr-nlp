  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
constant as a function of the maximum strain in com - 
pression deﬁned as: 
|u1D7≠≠|mCst|aCst|xCst = max(1 − |u1D7≠6|oneCst, 1 − |u1D7≠6|twoCst, 1. −|u1D7≠6|threeCst)  . 
In tension, the damping constant is set to the valu e cor- 
responding to the strain at 0.0.  The abscissa shou ld be 
deﬁned from 0.0 to 1.0.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
SHAPE Shape factor for unloading.  Active for nonzero val ues of the 
hysteretic unloading factor.  Values less than one reduce the 
energy dissipation and greater than one increase di ssipation; see 
also Figure M179-1  and Remarks 1  and 2. 
FAIL Failure option after cutoﬀ stress is reached: 
EQ.0.0: tensile stress remains at cut-oﬀ value, 
EQ.1.0: tensile stress is reset to zero. 
BVFLAG Bulk viscosity activation ﬂag: 
EQ.0.0: no bulk viscosity (recommended), 
EQ.1.0: bulk viscosity active. 
ED Optional Young's relaxation modulus, |u1D438/u1D451.st, for rate eﬀects.  
BETA1 Optional decay constant, |u1D6FD|oneCst. 
KCON Stiﬀness coeﬃcient for contact interface stiﬀness.  If undeﬁned, 
the maximum slope in the stress as a function of st rain curve is 
used.  When the maximum slope is used for the conta ct, the time 
step size for this material is reduced for stabilit y.  In some cases, 
∆|u1D461 may be signiﬁcantly smaller, so deﬁning a reasonabl e stiﬀness *.
