For discrete (type 6) beam elements, which are used  to model complicated dampers and 
multi-dimensional spring-damper combinations, the f ollowing material types are 
available: 
 *.   *.   *.   
This is Material Type 326 developed for analysis of  gaskets.  This material model can 
only be used with cohesive elements.  Also, a gaske t thickness must be set; see the 
variable ELFORM and GASKETT in *SECTION_SOLID.

Remarks: 
1.  Cohesive Elements for Modeling Gaskets.   A gasket is a mechanical seal 
placed between two mating surfaces to prevent leaka ge.  A gasket is typically 
thin in comparison to the length and width of its s urface.  This makes it cum- 
bersome to model with solid elements, since these r equire good aspect ratios.  
Cohesive elements, however, are less sensitive to t his kind of geometric quality 
and are, therefore, better suited for modeling gask ets.  To use cohesive ele- 
ments for modeling gaskets, the normal (the local 3-direction) of the cohesive 
element must be aligned with the gasket thickness d irection, and the mid-
surface of the cohesive element (the local 1-, and 2-direction) must coincide 
with the gasket surface.   
2.  Material Model.  The strains pertaining to the normal are deﬁned by:  |u1D7≠≠|oneCst|threeCst = |u1D6FF|oneCst, 
|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|threeCst = |u1D6FF|twoCst, and |u1D7≠≠|threeCst|threeCst = |u1D6FF|threeCst. |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst is the separation in local direction |u1D4J6 = 1,2,3 , meaning 
the relative displacement between the top and botto m face of the cohesive ele- 
ment measured along local direction |u1D4J6. In particular, −|u1D7≠≠|threeCst|threeCst  is the so-called gas- 
ket closure, /u1D450. The so-called membrane strains, |u1D7≠≠|oneCst|oneCst , |u1D7≠≠|oneCst|twoCst , and  |u1D7≠≠|twoCst|twoCst , in the plane 
orthogonal to the normal follow the usual deﬁnition  |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = (|u1D71J|u1D4J7Cst|u1D462|u1D4J6Cst+ |u1D71J|u1D4J6Cst|u1D462|u1D4J7Cst)/2, 
where |u1D462|u1D4J6Cst, |u1D4J6 = 1,2 , is the local displacement of the mid-surface.  *.  
 tinue on the main loading curve until some new poin t D, where unloading 
takes place.  The new unloading then follows the pa th DEA back to A. If un- 
loading occurs between two unloading curves, interp olation is used to deter- 
mine the pressure. 
Which unloading path to follow and where to switch to the main loading curve 
is determined by keeping track of the maximum value  of /u1D450, called /u1D450max , at the 
last unloading point.  If the closure becomes negat ive, that is, the gasket is sub- 
ject to tension rather than compression, its stiﬀne ss is given by |u1D438|u1D447Cst|u1D438Cst|u1D441Cst . This is 
mostly for numerical stability.  The unloading curv es must be input using *DE-
FINE_TABLE_2D, with the ﬁrst dependency being maxim um closure and the 
second closure, meaning |u1D4JD = |u1D4JD(/u1D450|u1D4JACst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D46JCst ,/u1D450). Also, the unloading curves should be in 
a normalized form giving zero pressure for zero clo sure and unit pressure for 
unit closure. 
4.  History Variables.   This material model outputs the maximum closure a s 
history variable #1 to the post-processing database .  Therefore, NEIPH and 
NEIPS must be set in *DATABASE_EXTENT_BINARY. *
