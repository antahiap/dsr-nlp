Remarks: 
1.  Plane Stress Failure Criteria.  The underlying material behavior before 
failure is isotropic, small strain linear elasticit y with Young’s modulus, |u1D438, and 
Poisson’s ratio, /u1D̅08. Asymmetric (tension-compression dependent) failur e hap- 
pens as soon as one of the following plane stress f ailure criteria is violated. 
a)  Rankine Maximum Stress.   For FMOD = 0, a maximum stress criterion 
(Rankine) is used where principal stresses, |u1D7≠∆|oneCst and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst, are bound by tensile 
strength, |u1D4J3|u1D461Cst, and compressive strength, |u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst, as follows: 
−|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst<{|u1D7≠∆|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|twoCst}< |u1D4J3|u1D461Cst 
b)  Mohr-Coulomb.   With FMOD = 1, the Mohr-Coulomb criterion with ex - 
pressions in four diﬀerent categories is used: 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst> 0 and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst> 0:  max |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆|oneCst
|u1D4J3|u1D461Cst,|u1D7≠∆|twoCst
|u1D4J3|u1D461Cst|parenriµhtCvJ < 1
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst< 0 and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst< 0:             max |parenleftCvJ−|u1D7≠∆|oneCst
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst, −|u1D7≠∆|twoCst
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|parenriµhtCvJ < 1
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst> 0 and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst< 0:  |u1D7≠∆|oneCst
|u1D4J3|u1D461Cst−|u1D7≠∆|twoCst
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst< 1
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst< 0 and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst> 0: −|u1D7≠∆|oneCst
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst+|u1D7≠∆|twoCst
|u1D4J3|u1D461Cst< 1 
c)  Drucker-Prager.   For FMOD = 2, the plane stress Drucker-Prager cri terion 
is given by: *.   
 4.  Number of Failed Integration Points.   If the critical number of failed 
integration points (NIPF) in one element is reached , all integration points over 
the element thickness fail as well.  The default va lue of NIPF=1 resembles the 
fact, that a crack in a glass plate immediately run s through the thickness. 
5.  Damage Model.   Starting with the release of LS-DYNA version R10,  a damage 
model for stress and stiﬀness softening can be acti vated with IMOD = 1. The 
corresponding evolution law for ILAW = 0 is given b y: 
|u1D437 =
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧ 0 for /u1D̅05≤/u1D̅05|zeroCst
1 −/u1D̅05|zeroCst
/u1D̅05|parenleftCv31 − |u1D6F+|u1D461Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J≠Cst+ |u1D6F+|u1D461Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D461.sts/comm∙.sts/u1D4⃡0.sts|parenleftCv2/u1Dℜ0⃡.st−/u1Dℜ0⃡.st|zeroCsts|parenriµhtCv2|parenriµhtCv3otherwise  
meaning tensile and compressive failure are treated  in the same fashion.  
However, with ILAW = 1 the damage evolution for ten sile failure is given by: 
|u1D437 =
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧ 0 for /u1D̅05≤/u1D̅05|zeroCst
1 −/u1D̅05|zeroCst
/u1D̅05|parenleftCv31 − |u1D6F+|u1D461Cst+ |u1D6F+|u1D461Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D461.sts|parenleftCv2/u1Dℜ0⃡.st−/u1Dℜ0⃡.st|zeroCsts|parenriµhtCv2|parenriµhtCv3otherwise  
while damage for compressive failure evolves as (mo re delayed stress reduc- 
tion): 
|u1D437 =
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧ 0 for /u1D̅05≤/u1D̅05|zeroCst
1 −/u1D̅05|zeroCst
/u1D̅05(1 − |u1D6F+|u1D4J≠Cst) − |u1D6F+|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D4⃡0.sts|parenleftCv2/u1Dℜ0⃡.st−/u1Dℜ0⃡.st|zeroCsts|parenriµhtCv2otherwise  
6.  Nonlocal Failure.   A nonlocal failure criterion which is mainly inte nded for 
windshield impact can be deﬁned using ENGCRT and RA DCRT. The same 
procedure is used as in *.   *.
