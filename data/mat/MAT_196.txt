 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
DOF Active degree-of- freedom, a number between 1 and 6 inclusive.  
Each value of DOF can only be used once.  The activ e degree-of-
freedom is measured in the local coordinate system for the 
discrete beam element. 
TYPE Material behavior: 
EQ.0: elastic (default) 
EQ.1: inelastic  
K Elastic loading/unloading stiﬀness.  This is requir ed input for 
inelastic behavior. 
D Optional viscous damping coeﬃcient 
CDF Compressive displacement at failure.  Input as a po sitive number.  
After failure, no forces are carried.  This option does not apply to 
zero length springs. 
EQ.0.0: inactive 
TDF Tensile displacement at failure.  After failure, no  forces are 
carried. 
EQ.0.0: inactive

In these equations, ∆/u1D4:F is the change in length  
∆/u1D4:F= current length − initial length 
For the ﬁrst three degrees of freedom the ﬁelds on Cards 2 and 3 have dimen- 
sions as shown below.  Being angular in nature, the  next three degrees of free- 
dom involve moment instead of force and angle inste ad of length but are 
otherwise identical.

2.  Inelastic Behavior.   If TYPE = 1, inelastic behavior is obtained.  A t rial force is 
computed as: 
|u1D439|u1D447Cst= |u1D439|u1D4JBCst+ |u1D43∆ × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ(∆|u1D461) 
and the yield force is taken from the load curve: 
|u1D439/u1D44C.st= |u1D439|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2∆/u1D4:F/p.st/l.st|aCst|sCst|tCst|iCst /c.st|parenriµhtCv2  , 
where /u1D4:F/p.st/l.st|aCst|sCst|tCst|iCst /c.st is the plastic deﬂection, given by  
∆/u1D4:F/p.st/l.st|aCst|sCst|tCst|iCst /c.st=|u1D439|u1D447Cst− |u1D439/u1D44C.st
|u1D446 + |u1D43∆|mCst|aCst|xCst   . 
The maximum elastic stiﬀness is |u1D43∆|mCst|aCst|xCst = max(|u1D43∆, 2 × |u1D446|mCst|aCst|xCst ), where |u1D446 is the slope 
of FLCID. The trial force is checked against the yi eld force to determine |u1D439: 
|u1D439 = |<raceleftCvJ|u1D439/u1D44C.stif  |u1D439|u1D447Cst> |u1D439/u1D44C.st
|u1D439|u1D447Cstif  |u1D439|u1D447Cst≤ |u1D439/u1D44C.st 
The ﬁnal force, which includes rate eﬀects and damp ing, is given by: *
