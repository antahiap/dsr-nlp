This is  Material Type 3.  This model is suited for modellin g isotropic and kinematic 
hardening plasticity with the option of including r ate eﬀects.  It is a very cost-eﬀective 
model and is available for beam (Hughes-Liu and Tru ss), shell, and solid elements.

2-150 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
SRP Strain rate parameter, |u1D4JD, for Cowper Symonds strain rate model; 
see Remark 1 .  If zero, rate eﬀects are not considered. 
FS Eﬀective plastic strain for eroding elements 
VP Formulation for rate eﬀects: 
EQ.0.0:  scale yield stress (default) 
EQ.1.0:  viscoplastic formulation (recommended) 
Remarks: 
1.  Cowper Symonds Strain Rate Model.   Strain rate is accounted for using the 
Cowper and Symonds model which scales the yield str ess with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate.  A fully viscoplastic formulat ion is optional which 
incorporates the Cowper and Symonds formulation wit hin the yield surface.  
To ignore strain rate eﬀects set both SRC and SRP t o zero. 
2.  Hardening Parameter.   Kinematic, isotropic, or a combination of kinemat ic 
and isotropic hardening may be speciﬁed by varying |u1D6FD′ between 0 and 1.  For β=1, isotropic hardeningβ=0, kinematic hardeninglnl
