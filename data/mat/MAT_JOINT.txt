This is Material Type 198. Joints (planes of weakne ss) are assumed to exist throughout 
the material at a spacing small enough to be consid ered ubiquitous.  The planes are 
assumed to lie at constant orientations deﬁned on t his material card.  Up to three planes 
can be deﬁned for each material.  See *. ED_ROCK

characters must be speciﬁed. 
RO Mass density 
GMOD Elastic shear modulus 
RNU Poisson’s ratio 
RKF Failure surface shape parameter 
PHI Angle of friction (radians)

STR_LIM Minimum shear strength of material is given  by STR_LIM*CVAL  
NPLANES Number of joint planes (maximum 3) 
ELASTIC Flag = 1 for elastic behavior only 
LCCPDR Load curve for extra cohesion for parent mat erial (dyn amic 
relaxation) 
LCCPT Load curve for extra cohesion for parent mate rial (transient) 
LCCJDR Load curve for extra cohesion for joints (dy namic relaxation) 
LCCJT Load curve for extra cohesion for joints (tra nsient) 
LCSFAC Load curve giving factor on strength vs time  *. ED_ROCK  
 will not be considered and only RO, GMOD, RNU, GMOD DP, GMODGR and 
the joint planes will be used. 
4.  This material type requires that the model is orie nted such that the z-axis is 
deﬁned in the upward direction.  The key parameters  are deﬁned such that 
may vary with depth (i.e. the z-axis) 
5.  The shape factor for a typical soil would be 0.8, but should not be pushed 
further than 0.75. 
6.  If STR_LIM is set to less than 0.005, the value is  reset to 0.005. 
7.  A correction has been introduced into the Drucker Prager model, such that the 
yield surface never infringes the Mohr-Coulomb crit erion.  This means that the 
model does not give the same results as a “pure” Dr ucker Prager model. 
8.  The load curves LCCPDR, LCCPT, LCCJDR, LCCJT allow  additional cohesion 
to be speciﬁed as a function of time.  The cohesion  is additional to that speci- 
ﬁed in the material parameters.  This is intended f or use during the initial stag- 
es of an analysis to allow application of gravity o r other loads without cracking 
or yielding, and for the cracking or yielding then to be introduced in a con- 
trolled manner.  This is done by specifying extra c ohesion that exceeds the 
expected stresses initially, then declining to zero .  If no curves are speciﬁed, no 
extra cohesion is applied. 
9.  The load curve for factor on strength applies simu ltaneously to the cohesion 
and tan (friction angle) of parent material and all  joints.  This feature is intend- 
ed for reducing the strength of the material gradua lly, to explore factors of 
safety.  If no curve is present, a constant factor of 1 is assumed.  Values much 
greater than 1.0 may cause problems with stability.  
10.  Extra variables for plotting.  By setting NEIPH on  *DATABASE_EXTENT_BI-
NARY to 15, the following variables can be plotted in D3PLOT and T/HIS: 
 Extra Variable 1: mobilized strength fraction for base material

 Extra Variable 3: rlamda for base material 
 Extra Variable 4:  crack opening strain for plane 1 
 Extra Variable 5: crack opening strain for plane 2  
 Extra Variable 6: crack opening strain for plane 3  
 Extra Variable 7: crack accumulated engineering sh ear strain for plane 1 
 Extra Variable 8: crack accumulated engineering sh ear strain for plane 2 
 Extra Variable 9: crack accumulated engineering sh ear strain for plane 3 
 Extra Variable 10: current shear utilization for p lane 1 
 Extra Variable 11: current shear utilization for p lane 2 
 Extra Variable 12: current shear utilization for p lane 3 *
