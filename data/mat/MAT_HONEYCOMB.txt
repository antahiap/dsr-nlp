This is  Material Type 26.  The major use of this material m odel is for honeycomb and 
foam materials with real anisotropic behavior.  A n onlinear elastoplastic material 
behavior can be deﬁned separately for all normal an d shear stresses.  These are 
considered to be fully uncoupled.  See notes below.

Remarks: 
1.  Stress Load Curves.   For eﬃciency it is strongly recommended that the load 
curves with IDs LCA, LCB, LCC, LCS, LCAB, LCBC, and  LCCA contain exact- 
ly the same number of points with corresponding str ain values on the abscissa.  
If this recommendation is followed the cost of the table lookup is insigniﬁcant.  
Conversely, the cost increases signiﬁcantly if the abscissa strain values are not 
consistent between load curves. *.

|u1D438|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst = |u1D438|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst|u1D462Cst + |u1D6FD(|u1D438 − |u1D438|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst|u1D462Cst )
|u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst = |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D462Cst + |u1D6FD(|u1D438 − |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D462Cst )
|u1D43A|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst = |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst|u1D462Cst + |u1D6FD(|u1D43A − |u1D43A|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst|u1D462Cst )
|u1D43A|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst = |u1D438|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D462Cst + |u1D6FD(|u1D43A − |u1D43A|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D462Cst )

where 
|u1D6FD = max |<racketleftCv6min |parenleftCv61 − |u1D449
1 − |u1D449/u1D45:.st, 1|parenriµhtCv6 , 0|<racketriµhtCv6 
and |u1D43A is the elastic shear modulus for the fully compact ed honeycomb material 
|u1D43A =|u1D438
2(1 + |u1D463). 
The relative volume, |u1D449, is deﬁned as the ratio of the current volume to t he ini- 
tial volume.  Typically, |u1D449 = 1  at the beginning of a calculation.  The viscosity 
coeﬃcient |u1D7≠7 (MU) should be set to a small number (usually .02 - .10 is okay).  
Alternatively, the two bulk viscosity coeﬃcients on  the control cards should be 
set to very small numbers to prevent the developmen t of spurious pressures 
that may lead to undesirable and confusing results.   The latter is not recom- 
mended since spurious numerical noise may develop. 
3.  Stress Updates.   At the beginning of the stress update each elemen t’s stresses 
and strain rates are transformed into the local ele ment coordinate system.  For 
the uncompacted material, the trial stress componen ts are updated using the 
elastic interpolated moduli (see Remark 2 ) according to: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial = |u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst |u1D4JBCst+ |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial = |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst |u1D4JBCst+ |u1D438|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst |u1D4JBCst+ |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial = |u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst |u1D4JBCst+ 2|u1D43A|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial = |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst |u1D4JBCst+ 2|u1D43A|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst |u1D4JBCst+1trial = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst |u1D4JBCst+ 2|u1D43A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst  
Each component of the updated stresses is then inde pendently checked to en- 
sure that they do not exceed the permissible values  determined from the load 
curves; for example, if 
/divides.v4|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial /divides.v4> |u1D7≠6|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst (|u1D449)  , 
then *.  which can exhibit nonphysic al stiﬀening for loading 
conditions that are oﬀ axis.  The curves given for I11, I22, I12 and I23 are used to deﬁne 
a yield surface of Tsai-Wu-type that bounds the dev iatoric stress tensor.  Hence the 
elastic parameters E11, E12, E22 and E23 as well as  G and K must be deﬁned in a 
consistent way.  
For the curve deﬁnitions volumetric strain |u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst= 1 − |u1D449/|u1D449|zeroCst is used as the abscissa 
parameter.  If the symmetric option (NSYM = 1) is u sed, a curve must be provided for 
the ﬁrst quadrant, but may also be deﬁned in both t he ﬁrst and second quadrants.  If 
NSYM = 0 is chosen, the curve deﬁnitions for I11, I 22, I12 and I23 (and IAA) must be in 
the ﬁrst and second quadrant as shown in Figure M142-1 .  
Tensor viscosity, which is activated by a nonzero v alue for MU, is generally more stable 
than bulk viscosity.  A damping coeﬃcient less than  0.01 has little eﬀect, and a value 
greater than 0.10 may cause numerical instabilities . NSYM = 0
