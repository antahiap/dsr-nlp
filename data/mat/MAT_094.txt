  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
FLCID Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning the yield force as 
a function of plastic deﬂection.  If the origin of the curve is at 
(0,0) , the force magnitude is identical in tension and compression, 
that is, only the sign changes.  If not, the yield stress in the 
compression is used when the spring force is negati ve.  The 
plastic displacement increases monotonically in thi s implementa- 
tion.  The load curve is required input. 
HLCID Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning force as a 
function of relative velocity (optional).  If the o rigin of the curve is 
at (0,0) , the force magnitude is identical for a given magn itude of 
the relative velocity, that is, only the sign chang es. 
C1 Damping coeﬃcient 
C2 Damping coeﬃcient 
DLE Factor to scale time units 
GLCID Optional load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning a scale 
factor as a function of deﬂection for load curve ID , HLCID.  If 
zero, a scale factor of unity is assumed. 
Remarks: 
1.  Force.  To determine the force, a trial force is ﬁrst compu ted as: 
|u1D439|u1D447Cst= |u1D439|u1D4JBCst+ K × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ(∆|u1D461) 
The yield force is taken from the load curve: 
|u1D439/u1D44C.st= |u1D439|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2∆/u1D4:Fplastic |parenriµhtCv2  , 
where /u1D4:Fplastic  is the plastic deﬂection, given by  
∆/u1D4:Fplastic =|u1D439|u1D447Cst− |u1D439/u1D44C.st
|u1D446 + |u1D43∆max    . 
Here |u1D446 is the slope of FLCID and |u1D43∆max  is the maximum elastic stiﬀness: 
|u1D43∆max = max(|u1D43∆, 2 × |u1D446max )  . 
The trial force is, then, checked against the yield  force to determine |u1D439: 
|u1D439 =/˙raceleft.v6|u1D439/u1D44C.st  |u1D4J6|u1D4J3   |u1D439|u1D447Cst> |u1D439/u1D44C.st
|u1D439|u1D447Cst  |u1D4J6|u1D4J3   |u1D439|u1D447Cst≤ |u1D439/u1D44C.st 
The ﬁnal force, which includes rate eﬀects and damp ing, is given by: *
