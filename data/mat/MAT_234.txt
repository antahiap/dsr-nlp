 Remarks: 
The parameters of the Representative Volume Cell (R VC) are: the yarn span, |u1D46≠, the 
fabric thickness, |u1D461, the yarn width, |u1D464, and the yarn cross-sectional area, |u1D434. The initially 
orthogonal yarns (see Figure M234-2 a) are free to rotate (see Figure M234-2 b) up to 
some angle and after that the lateral contact betwe en the yarns causes the locking of the 
trellis mechanism and the packing of the yarns (see  Figure M234-2 c).The minimum 
braid angle, /u1D̅0:min , can be calculated from the geometry and the archi tecture of the fabric 
material having the yarn width, |u1D464, and the span between the yarns, |u1D46≠: 
sin(2/u1D̅0:|mCst|iCst|nCst ) =|u1D464
|u1D46≠  . 
The range angle, /u1D̅0:loc k , and the maximum braid angle, /u1D̅0:max , are then easily determined 
as: 
/u1D̅0:loc k = 45 °−/u1D̅0:|mCst|iCst|nCst   ,      /u1D̅0:|mCst|aCst|xCst = 45 °+/u1D̅0:loc k    
 
The material behavior of the yarn can be simply des cribed by a combination of one 
Maxwell element without the dashpot and one Kelvin- Voigt element.  The 1-D model of 
viscoelasticity is shown in Figure M234-3 . The diﬀerential equation of viscoelasticity of 
the yarns can be derived from the model equilibrium  as in the following equation: 
(|u1D43∆|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D43∆|u1D44FCst)|u1D7≠∆ + |u1D7≠7|u1D44FCst|u1D7≠∆̇= |u1D43∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D43∆|u1D44FCst|u1D7≠≠ + |u1D7≠7|u1D44FCst|u1D43∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D7≠≠̇ 
The input parameters for the viscoelasticity model of the material are only the static 
Young’s modulus  |u1D438|oneCst, the Hookian spring coeﬃcient (EKA) |u1D43∆|u1D44∆Cst, the viscosity coeﬃcient θ

 where |u1D438|twoCst is the transverse Young’s modulus of the yarns, |u1D43A|oneCst|twoCst  is the longitudinal shear 
modulus, and |u1D6F+ is the lateral contact factor.  The lateral contac t factor is zero when the 
trellis mechanism is open and unity if the mechanis m is locked with full lateral contact 
between the yarns.  There is a transition range, ∆/u1D̅0:× TA , of the average braid angle, /u1D̅0:, in 
which the lateral contact factor, |u1D6F+, is a linear function of the average braid angle.  The 
graph of the function |u1D6F+(/u1D̅0:) is shown in Figure M234-4 .θα
