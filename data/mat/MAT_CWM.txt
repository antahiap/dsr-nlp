evaluation of thermal expansion 
POSTV Deﬁne additional history variables that might  be useful for post-
processing.  See remarks below for details. 
Remarks: 
1.  Material birth.   This material is initially in a quiet state, some times referred to 
as a ghost material.  In this state the material ha s the thermo-elastic properties 
deﬁned by the quiet Young’s modulus, quiet Poisson’ s ratio and quiet thermal 
expansion coeﬃcient.  These should represent void, i.e., the Young’s modulus 
should be small enough to not inﬂuence the surround ings but large enough to 
avoid numerical problems.  A quiet material stress should never reach the 
yield point.  When the temperature reaches the birt h temperature, a history 
variable representing the indicator of the welding material is incremented.  
This variable follows 
|u1D6F∆(|u1D461) = min |parenleftCv61, max |<racketleftCv60,|u1D447max − |u1D447|u1D4J9Cststart 
|u1D447|u1D4J9Cstend − |u1D447|u1D4J9Cststart |<racketriµhtCv6|parenriµhtCv6 
where |u1D447max = max 
|u1D46≠Cst≤|u1D461Cst|u1D447(|u1D46≠) . This parameter is available as history variable 9  in the 
output database.  The eﬀective thermo-elastic mater ial properties are interpo- 
lated as 
|u1D438 = |u1D438(|u1D447)|u1D6F∆ + |u1D438quiet (1 − |u1D6F∆) 
/u1D̅08=/u1D̅08(|u1D447)|u1D6F∆ +/u1D̅08quiet (1 − |u1D6F∆) 
|u1D6F+ = |u1D6F+(|u1D447, |u1D447max )|u1D6F∆ + |u1D6F+quiet (1 − |u1D6F∆)  
where |u1D438, /u1D̅08, and |u1D6F+ are the Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and therma l expan- 
sion coeﬃcient, respectively.  Here, the thermal ex pansion coeﬃcient is either a 
temperature dependent curve, or a collection of tem perature dependent 
curves, ordered in a table according to maximum tem perature |u1D447max .  
2.  Stress Update.   The stress update follows a classical isotropic a ssociative 
thermo-elastic-plastic approach with kinematic hard ening that is summarized 
in the following.  The explicit temperature depende nce is sometimes dropped 
for the sake of clarity.  
 
The stress evolution is given as 
σ̇=/u1D402|parenleftCv2ε̇−ε̇|u1D4JDCst−ε̇|u1D447Cst|parenriµhtCv2 *.   
 as a negative value.  A strictly positive value mea ns that the material has 
reached temperature T2PHASE and gone down to T1PHAS E and the history 
variable is (T2P H ASE − T1P H ASE) (T1 − T2) ⁄ , where T2 is the time when 
temperature T2PHASE is reached and T1 is the time w hen temperature 
T1PHASE is reached.  Note that T2P H ASE > T1P H ASE  and T1 > T2 . A value 
of zero means that the element has not yet reached temperature T2PHASE. A 
strictly negative value means that the element has reached temperature 
T2PHASE but not yet T1PHASE. 
5.  History variables.   This material formulation outputs additional data  for post-
processing to the set of history variables if reque sted by the user.  The parame- 
ter POSTV deﬁnes the data to be written.  Its value  is calculated as 
POST V = a|oneCst+ 2 |u1D44∆|twoCst+ 4 |u1D44∆|threeCst+8 |u1D44∆|fourCst 
Each ﬂag  |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary (can be either 1 or 0) and corresponds  to one particular 
post-processing variable according to the following  table. 
 
 
Flag Description Variables # hist 
|u1D44∆|oneCst Accumulated thermal strain  |u1D7≠≠|u1D447Cst 1 
|u1D44∆|twoCst Accumulated strain tensor  /u1D6C6 6 
|u1D44∆|threeCst Plastic strain tensor  /u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst 6 
|u1D44∆|fourCst Equivalent strain  |u1D7≠≠/V.st/M.st   1 
 
The above table also shows the order of output as w ell as the number of extra history 
variables associated with the particular ﬂag. The v alues of these user-deﬁned histories 
are reset when the temperature is in the annealing range. 
 
In total NXH extra variables are required depending  on the choice of parameter POSTV. 
For example, the maximum number of additional varia bles is NXH  =  14 for 
POSTV  =  15. 
 
A complete list of history variables for the materi al is given in the following table.  
“Position” refers to the history variable number as  listed by LS-PrePost when post-
processing the d3plot database.  The variable NEIPS  in *DATABASE_EXTENT_BINA-
RY must to set to output these history variables.
