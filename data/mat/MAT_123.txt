speciﬁed (see *PART).

FAIL Failure ﬂag: 
LT.0.0: User deﬁned failure subroutine, matusr_24  in 
dyn21.F , is called to determine failure. 
EQ.0.0: Failure is not considered.  This option is recommen ded 
if failure is not of interest since many calculatio ns will 
be saved. 
GT.0.0: Plastic strain to failure.  W hen the plastic strain reaches 
this value, the element is deleted from the calcula tion. *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
natural log of strain rate when the lowest strain r ate and highest 
strain rate diﬀer by several orders of magnitude.  There is some 
additional computational cost associated with invok ing 
logarithmic interpolation. 
LCSR Load curve ID deﬁning strain rate scaling eﬀec t on yield stress 
VP Formulation for rate eﬀects: 
EQ.0.0: Scale yield stress (default) 
EQ.1.0: Viscoplastic formulation (recommended) 
EPSTHIN Thinning strain at failure.  To specify thinning st rain to failure as 
a function of plastic strain rate, see LCTSRF. 
GT.0.0: Total thinning strain (as in ISTUPD = 1; see *CON-
TROL_SHELL) 
LT.0.0: Plastic thinning strain |EPST H IN | (as in ISTUPD = 4) 
EPSMAJ Major in plane strain at failure for shells (or) ma jor principal 
strain at failure for solids (see Remark 1 ). 
LT.0: EPSMAJ = |EPSMAJ| and ﬁltering is activated.  The last 
twelve values of the major strain is stored at each  integra- 
tion point and the average value is used to determi ne 
failure. 
NUMINT Number of integration points which must fail before  the element 
is deleted.  (If zero, all points must fail.)  For fully integrated shell 
formulations, each of the 4 × NIP integration points are counted 
individually in determining a total for failed inte gration points.  
NIP is the number of through- thickness integration points.  As 
NU MINT approaches the total number of integration poi nts (NIP 
for under integrated shells, 4 × NIP for fully integrated shells), the 
chance of instability increases. 
LT.0.0: |N U MINT|  is the percentage of integration 
points/layers which must fail before the shell elem ent 
fails.  For fully integrated shells, a methodology is used 
where a l ayer fails if one integration point fails and then 
the given percentage of layers must fail before the  ele- 
ment fails.  Only available for shells. 
 *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCTSRF Curve that deﬁnes the thinning strain at failure as  a function of 
the plastic strain rate ( The curve should not extrapolate to zero or 
failure may occur at low strain. ) If LCT SRF is given, the absolute 
value of EP STHIN is unimportant; however, the algebraic sign o f 
EPSTHIN governs whether ordinate values in curve LC T SRF are 
interpreted as total or plastic thinning strain.  F or example, if 
plastic thinning strain should be used, then EP STHIN should be 
input as a negative value. 
EPS0 EPS0 parameter for RTCL damage (see Remark 2 ): 
EQ.0.0: RTCL damage is inactive (default). 
GT.0.0: RTCL damage is active. 
TRIAX RTCL damage triaxiality limit (see Remark 2 ): 
EQ.0.0: No limit (default) 
GT.0.0: Damage does not accumulate when triaxiality exceeds  
TRIAX. 
IPS Flag to add prestrain when checking for major strai n failure (see 
EPSMAJ above on Card 2) for the PRESTRAIN keyword o ption: 
EQ.0:  No prestrain added (default) 
EQ.1:  Initial strain set with *INITIAL_STRAIN_ SHELL will be 
used as a prestrain when checking for major strain fail- 
ure (VP = 0 and shells only). 
LCEMOD Load curve ID deﬁning Young’s mod ulus as function of eﬀective 
strain rate.  LCEMOD ≠ 0 activates viscoelasticity.   See *.   *.   
 The value of |u1D4J3damage  is stored as history variable #9 and can be fringe  plotted 
from d3plot  ﬁles if the number of extra history variables requ ested is ≥ 9 on 
*DATABASE_EXTENT_BINARY.  
The optional TRIAX parameter can be used to prevent  excessive RTCL damage 
growth and element erosion for badly shaped element s that might show unre- 
alistically high values for the triaxiality.  The t riaxiality, |u1D7≠∆Cst/u1D43B.sts
|u1D7≠∆Cst/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt, is stored as history 
variable #11. 
3.  Instability Indicator.  To get an idea about the probability of failure, a n 
indicator |u1D437 is computed internally: 
|u1D437 = max |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst
FAIL ,−|u1D7≠≠|threeCst
EPST H IN ,|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:C.st
EPSMAJ |parenriµhtCv6 
and stored as history variable #10.  |u1D437 ranges from 0 (intact) to 1 (failed). |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst, 
−|u1D7≠≠|threeCst, and |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:C.st are current values of eﬀective plastic strain, thi nning strain, and 
major in plane strain.  This instability measure, i ncluding the RTCL damage, 
can also be retrieved from requesting material hist ories

Implicit Calculations.   For implicit calculations with this material invo lving severe 
nonlinear hardening, the radial return method may r esult in inaccurate stress-strain 
response.  Setting IACC = 1 on *CONTROL_ACCURACY ac tivates a fully iterative 
plasticity algorithm, which will remedy this.  This  is not to be confused with the MITER 
ﬂag on *CONTROL_SHELL, which governs the treatment of the plane stress 
assumption for shell elements.  If any failure mode l is applied with this option, incident 
failure will initiate damage, and the stress will c ontinuously degrade to zero before 
erosion for a deformation of 1 %  plastic strain.  For instance, if the failure stra in is 
FAIL = 0.05 , then the element is eroded when |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.06  and the material goes from 
intact to completely damaged between |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.05  and |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.06 . The reason is to enhance 
implicit performance by maintaining continuity in t he internal forces. *
