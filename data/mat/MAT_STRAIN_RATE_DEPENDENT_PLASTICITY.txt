Both the Young's modulus and the tangent modulus ma y optionally be made 
functions of strain rate by specifying a load curve  ID giving their values as a 
function of strain rate.  If these load curve IDs a re input as 0, then the constant 
values speciﬁed in the input are used. 
2.  Load Curves.   Note that all load curves used to deﬁne quantitie s as a function 
of strain rate must have the same number of points at the same strain rate val- 
ues.  This requirement is used to allow vectorized interpolation to enhance the 
execution speed of this constitutive model. 
3.  Material Failure.   This model also contains a simple mechanism for m odeling 
material failure.  This option is activated by spec ifying a load curve ID deﬁning 
the eﬀective stress at failure as a function of str ain rate.  For solid elements, 
once the eﬀective stress exceeds the failure stress  the element is deemed to 
have failed and is removed from the solution.  For shell elements the entire 
shell element is deemed to have failed if all integ ration points through the 
thickness have an eﬀective stress that exceeds the failure stress.  After failure 
the shell element is removed from the solution. 
In addition to the above failure criterion, this ma terial model also supports a 
shell element deletion criterion based on the maxim um stable time step size for 
the element, ∆|u1D461|mCst|aCst|xCst .  Generally, ∆|u1D461|mCst|aCst|xCst  goes down as the element becomes more 
distorted.  To assure stability of time integration , the global LS-DYNA time 
step is the minimum of the ∆|u1D461|mCst|aCst|xCst  values calculated for all elements in the mod- 
el.  Using this option allows the selective deletio n of elements whose time step 
∆|u1D461|mCst|aCst|xCst  has fallen below the speciﬁed minimum time step, ∆|u1D461crit .  Elements 
which are severely distorted often indicate that ma terial has failed and sup- 
ports little load, but these same elements may have  very small time steps and 
therefore control the cost of the analysis.  This o ption allows these highly dis- 
torted elements to be deleted from the calculation,  and, therefore, the analysis 
can proceed at a larger time step, and, thus, at a reduced cost.  Deleted ele- 
ments do not carry any load and are deleted from al l applicable slide surface 
deﬁnitions.  Clearly, this option must be judicious ly used to obtain accurate 
results at a minimum cost. 
4.  Viscoplastic Formulation.   A fully viscoplastic formulation is optional whic h 
incorporates the rate formulation within the yield surface.  An additional cost 
is incurred but the improvement is results can be d ramatic. *
