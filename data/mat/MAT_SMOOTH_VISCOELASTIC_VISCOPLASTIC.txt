This is Material Type 275, a smooth viscoelastic vi scoplastic model based on the works 
of Hollenstein et.al.  [2013, 2014] and Jabareen [2 015].  The stress response is 
rheologically represented by HJR (Hollenstein-Jabar een-Rubin) elements in parallel (see 
Figure 0-1 ), where each element exhibits combinations of visc oelastic and viscoplastic 
characteristics.  The model is based on large displ acement hyper-elastoplasticity and the 
numerical implementation is strongly objective; thi s together with the smooth 
characteristics makes it especially suitable for im plicit analysis.

Remarks: 
The Cauchy stress for this smooth viscoelastic visc oplastic material is given by 
/u1D6D4= |u1D43∆(/u1D4:D− 1)/u1D408+ |summationCv1/u1D42C|u1D4J6Cst|sixCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst   , 
where |u1D43∆ is the elastic bulk modulus provided on the ﬁrst c ard and /u1D4:D= det(/u1D405) is the 
relative volume with /u1D46D being the total deformation gradient.  The deviato ric stresses, /u1D4∫4|u1D4J6Cst, 
are coming from the HJR (Hollenstein-Jabareen-Rubin)  elements in parallel.  Up to 6 such 
elements can be deﬁned for the deviatoric response and a rheological representation of 
one is shown in Figure 0-1 . Each element is associated with 8 material parame ters that 
are provided on the optional cards and characterize  its inelastic response.  All this 
allows for a wide range of stress strain relationsh ips.  The critical part involves 
estimating parameters for a given test suite.  Some  elaboration on the physical 
interpretation of the individual parameters in the context of uniaxial stress is given 
following a general description of the model. 
 
We analyze one HJR element by letting /u1D401/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt denote the associated isochoric elastic left 
Cauchy-Green tensor.  Deﬁne

where |u1D44F̅ is the component of /u1D401/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt in the direction of deformation and /u1D̅0F is the uniaxial 
Kirchhoﬀ stress.  The evolution of /u1D6E4 follows the equations above with

Even though analytical solutions may be out of reac h, this would be the basis for 
estimating as well as interpreting the material par ameters.  Obviously the shear 
modulus |u1D43A (SHEAR) provides the elastic deviatoric stiﬀness, for a purely elastic 
material just deﬁne one such parameter and leave ou t all the other parameters on the 
same card.  If several cards are used, the eﬀective  elastic shear stiﬀness is the sum of the 
contributions from each of the corresponding HJR el ements.  An interesting observation 
is that the stress in a HJR element saturates to a value given by the solution of |u1D44F̅ to

For a nonzero |u1D44F|zeroCst (B0) with other parameters set to zero, a rate ind ependent plastic 
response is obtained exhibiting zero yield stress, that is, inelastic strains develop 
immediately upon loading.  From ( M275.2 ) the value of |u1D44F|zeroCst determines the saturated 
stress value for the associated HJR element by ( M275.1 ) and 
|u1D44F̅= |parenleftCvJ|u1D44F|zeroCst±1
|u1D44F|zeroCst∓2|parenriµhtCvJ|twoCst/|threeCst
 
in tension ( +) and compression ( −), respectively.  A smooth response is obtained tha t is 
characterized by hysteresis as shown in Figure M275-2 . The same material parameters 
as in the previous example are used with the except ion of varying |u1D44F|zeroCst instead of |u1D44∆|zeroCst. The 
deformation is controlled by a cyclic Cauchy stress  between −0.25  and 0.25 ; for larger |u1D44F|zeroCst 
a hysteresis is observed.  It should however be men tioned that the hysteresis vanishes 
as |u1D44F|zeroCst→∞  as the stress for the second element saturates qui ckly to a small value, so it is 
not trivial to quantitatively estimate the amount o f hysteresis for a given parameter 
setting and deformation. 
 
Rate independent plasticity with a nonzero yield st ress can be obtained by a nonzero |u1D44F|oneCst 
(B1) in combination with parameters /u1D̅05|zeroCst (KAPA0), /u1D̅05|u1D46≠Cst (KAPAS) and |u1D4JA (M).  The yield 
stress in the sense of von Mises is given by 
|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st= 2|u1D43A/u1D4:D−|oneCst/u1D̅05 
from which /u1D̅05 is interpreted as the current yield strain.  Here |u1D44F|oneCst determines the amount 
of overstress through ( M275.1 ) and ( M275.2 ), requiring the solution of a non-trivial -0.08-0.05-0.030.000.020.050.07

 0.01  and |u1D4JA = 0 , where we have set |u1D44∆|oneCst= 1000  and |u1D44F|oneCst= 10 . The engineering strain rate 
varies from 0.2 to 20 and for small strain rates ( M275.3 ) can be used for estimating the 
saturated stress, but in general ( M275.2 ) must be used. 
 
Putting several HJR elements in parallel can thus p rovide a fairly general combination 
of viscoelastic/viscoplastic response with isotropi c hardening/softening, but this of 
course requires a rich test suite and a good way of  estimating the material parameters.  
Presumably it is often suﬃcient to neglect some eﬀe cts and work with only a subset of 
the material parameters. 
 
For post-processing, the eﬀective plastic strain in  this model is deﬁned as 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst=/radical.v52
3/u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst∶/u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst  , 
where 
/u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst=/u1D6C6|u1D461Cst−/u1D6C6|u1D4J2Cst 
is a crude estimation of the diﬀerence between tota l and elastic strain.  We set 
/u1D6C6|u1D461Cst=1
2/u1D4:D|<racketleftCvJ/u1D401−1
3tr(/u1D401)/u1D408|<racketriµhtCvJ

2|u1D43A|<racketleftCvJ/u1D6D4−1
3tr(σ)/u1D408|<racketriµhtCvJ 
where 
/u1D401=/u1D4:D−|twoCst/|threeCst/u1D405/u1D405/ε.st 
and |u1D43A here is the sum of all shear moduli deﬁned on the HJR element cards.  Note that 
this does not correspond to the traditional measure  of eﬀective plastic strain which 
should be accounted for when validating results. *
