Default 0 0 0 0 0 0   
 
 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCT00R Table ID deﬁning for each plastic strain rate value  a load curve ID 
giving the (isothermal) tensile yield stress as a f unction of plastic 
strain for that rate in the 00 degree direction 
LCT00T Table ID deﬁning for each temperature value a load curve ID 
giving the (quasi-static) tensile yield stress as a  function of plast ic 
strain for that temperature in the 00 degree direct ion 
LCF Load curve ID or table ID. The load curve ID deﬁnes  plastic 
failure strain as a function of triaxiality.  The t able ID deﬁnes for 
each Lode parameter a load curve ID giving the plas tic failur e 
strain as a function of triaxiality for that Lode p arameter.  (Table 
option only for solids and not yet generally suppor ted.) 
LCG Load curve ID deﬁning plastic failure strain as a f unction of 
plastic strain rate 
LCH Load curve ID deﬁning plastic fail ure strain as a function of 
temperature 
LCI Load curve ID or table ID. The load curve ID deﬁnes  plastic 
failure strain as a function of element size.  The table ID deﬁnes 
for each triaxiality a load curve ID giving the pla stic failure strain 
as a function of element size for that triaxiality.
