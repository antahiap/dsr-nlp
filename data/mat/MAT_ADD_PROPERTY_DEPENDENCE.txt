LS-DYNA R13 2-117 (MAT) *.   
2-118 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 will be issued if a dependence curve is deﬁned on a  property of a material, 
which has no frequency or time dependence. 
3.  Initial Property Values.   The original property value deﬁned in a material card 
will be overridden by the property values deﬁned at  frequency or time 0 in this 
keyword.  If the starting frequency or time of LCID  in this keyword is larger 
than 0, then the original property value deﬁned in the material card is used 
until the starting frequency or time of LCID is rea ched. 
4.  Supported Material Models and Properties.   So far, only the Young’s
