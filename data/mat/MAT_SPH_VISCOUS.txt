  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
ﬁle is part of the general usermat  package.  Note that in 
this case MULO is a parameter for the subroutine. 
GT.0.0: this is the upper dynamic viscosity limit.  This is  
deﬁned only if RK and RN are deﬁn ed for the variable 
viscosity case. 
RK Variable dynamic viscosity multiplier.  See Remark 6 . 
RC Cross viscosity model: 
RC.GT.0.0: Cross viscosity model will be used which 
overwrites all other options.  The values of MU LO, 
MUHI, RK and RN will be used in the Cross viscos- 
ity model.  See Remark 7 . 
RC.LE.0.0: viscosity model based on above ﬁelds will be used. 
See Remark 6 . 
RN Variable dynamic viscosity exponent.  See Remark 6 . 
Remarks: 
1.  Deviatoric Viscous Stress.   This material must be used with an equation-of-
state.  Pressure cutoﬀ is negative in tension.  A ( deviatoric) viscous stress of the 
form 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst= 2|u1D7≠7|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst 
|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|<racketriµhtCvJ~|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ |<racketleftCvJ1
|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ 
is computed for nonzero |u1D7≠7 where |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst is the deviatoric strain rate.  |u1D7≠7 is the dy- 
namic viscosity.  For example, in the SI unit syste m, |u1D7≠7 has units of [Pa × s] . 
2.  Hourglass Control Issues.   This material has no shear stiﬀness and hourglass  
control must be used with care.  In some applicatio ns, the default hourglass 
coeﬃcient might lead to signiﬁcant energy losses.  In general for ﬂuid(s), the 
hourglass coeﬃcient QM should be small (in the rang e 10 -4 to 10 -6 for the stand- 
ard default IHQ choice). 
3.  Null Material Properties.   This material since it is based on the null mater ial 
has no yield strength and behaves in a ﬂuid-like ma nner. 
4.  Numerical Cavitation.   The pressure cut-oﬀ, PC, must be deﬁned to allow for 
a material to “numerically” cavitate.  In other wor ds, when a material under- *.   
 7.  Cross Viscous Model.   The Cross viscous model is one of simplest and mo st 
used model for shear-thinning behavior.  With shear -thinning behavior, the 
ﬂuid’s viscosity decreases with increasing local sh ear rate, |u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ.  Thus, using the 
Cross viscous model, the dynamic viscosity |u1D7≠7 is deﬁned as a function of |u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ: 
|u1D7≠7|parenleftCv1|u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ|minuteCst|parenriµhtCv1 = M UH I + (M U LO − M UH I)/(1.0 + RK × |u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ|minuteCst)RN−|oneCst  . 
Here RK and RN are two positive ﬁtting parameters, and MULO and MUHI 
are the limiting values of the viscosity at low and  high shear rates, respectively.  
RK, RN, MULO and MUHI are ﬁelds from the keyword in put. *
