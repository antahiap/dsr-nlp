STOCHASTIC 
This is  Material Type 98 implementing Johnson/Cook strain s ensitive plasticity.  It is 
used for problems where the strain rates vary over a large range.  In contrast to the full 
Johnson/Cook model (material type 15) this model in troduces the following 
simpliﬁcations: 
1.  thermal eﬀects and damage are ignored, 
2.  and the maximum stress is directly limited since t hermal softening which is 
very signiﬁcant in reducing the yield stress under adiabatic loading is not 
available. 
 
An iterative plane stress update is used for the sh ell elements, but due to the 
simpliﬁcations related to thermal softening and dam age, this model is 50% faster than 
the full Johnson/Cook implementation.  To compensat e for the lack of thermal 
softening, limiting stress values are introduced to  keep the stresses within reasonable 
limits. 
 
A resultant formulation for the Belytschko-Tsay, th e C0 Triangle, and the fully 
integrated type 16 shell elements is available and can be activated by specifying either 
zero or one through thickness integration point on the *SECTION_SHELL card.  While 
less accurate than through thickness integration, t his formulation runs somewhat faster.  
Since the stresses are not computed in the resultan t formulation, the stresses written to 
the databases for the resultant elements are set to  zero. 
 
This model is also available for the Hughes-Liu bea m, the Belytschko-Schwer beam, and 
for the truss element.  For the resultant beam form ulation, the rate eﬀects are 
approximated by the axial rate, since the thickness  of the beam about it bending axes is 
unknown.  Because this model is primarily used for structural analysis, the pressure is 
determined using the linear bulk modulus.

This is Material Type 181.  This material model pro vides a rubber and foam model 
deﬁned by a single uniaxial load curve or by a fami ly of uniaxial curves at discrete 
strain rates.  The deﬁnition of hysteretic unloadin g is optional and can be realized via a 
single uniaxial unloading curve or a two-parameter formulation (starting with 971 
release R5).  The foam formulation is triggered by deﬁning a Poisson’s ratio.  This 
material may be used with both shell and solid elem ents.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
VFLAG Type of viscoelasticity formulation.  This appears only on the ﬁrst 
line deﬁning G i, BETA i, and VFLAG. If VFLAG = 0, the standard 
viscoelasticity formulation is used (the default), and if 
VFLAG = 1, the viscoelasticity formulation using the 
instantaneous elastic stress is used. 
Remarks: 
The frequency independent damping is obtained by th e having a spring and slider in 
series as shown in the following sketch: 
 
The general failure criterion for polymers is propo sed by Feng and Hallquist as  
|u1D4J3 (/u1D4:C|oneCst,/u1D4:C|twoCst,/u1D4:C|threeCst) = (/u1D4:C|oneCst− 3) + Γ|oneCst(/u1D4:C|oneCst− 3)|twoCst+ Γ|twoCst(/u1D4:C|twoCst− 3) = |u1D43∆ 
where |u1D43∆ is a material parameter which controls the size en closed by the failure surface, 
and /u1D4:C|oneCst, /u1D4:C|twoCst and /u1D4:C|threeCst are the three invariants of right Cauchy-Green def ormation tensor ( /u1D402)

 For solid elements, rate eﬀects may also be taken i nto account through linear 
viscoelasticity by setting VISCO = 1.0.   For VFLAG  = 0, this is done through a 
convolution integral of the form: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D461Cst
|zeroCst∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst 
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F  
or in terms of the second Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress, {|u1D446|zeroCst }, and Green's strain tensor, {|u1D446RT }, 
|u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D438|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst 
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst 
where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) and |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) are the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent stre ss 
measures.  This stress is added to the stress tenso r determined from the strain energy 
functional. 
 
The relaxation function is represented by six terms  from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st |u1D461Cst |u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
given by, 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts|u1D461Cst|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a dampers and springs in 
series.  We characterize this in the input by shear  moduli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6, and decay constants, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6  
An arbitrary number of terms may be used. 
 
For VFLAG = 1, the viscoelastic term is 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D461Cst
|zeroCst∂|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst |u1D438Cst
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F  
where |u1D7≠∆/u1D458/u1D45∫|u1D438 is the instantaneous stress evaluated from the int ernal energy functional.  The 
coeﬃcients in the Prony series therefore correspond  to normalized relaxation moduli 
instead of elastic moduli. 
 
The Mooney-Rivlin rubber model (model 27) is obtain ed by specifying n = 1.  In spite of 
the diﬀerences in formulations with model 27, we ﬁn d that the results obtained with 
this model are nearly identical with those of mater ial 27 as long as large values of 
Poisson’s ratio are used. *. ED_RUBBER_WITH_DAMAGE

This is Material Type 183. This material model prov ides an incompressible rubber 
model deﬁned by a single uniaxial load curve for lo ading (or a table if rate eﬀects are 
considered) and a single uniaxial load curve for un loading.  This model is similar to 
*. ED_RUBBER/FOAM.  This materia l may be used with 
both shell and solid elements.
