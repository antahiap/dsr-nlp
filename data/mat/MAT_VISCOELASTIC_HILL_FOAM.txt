  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
reliable. 
GSTART Starting value for the least squares ﬁt.  If zero, a default value is 
set equal to the inverse of the largest time in the  experiment.  
Deﬁne this number if LCVE is nonzero.  See remarks below.

 where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) and |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)  are the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent str ess 
measures.  This stress is added to the stress tenso r determined from the strain energy 
functional. 
 
If we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, the relaxation function is represented by 
six terms from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst 
given by, 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts |u1D461Cst|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a dampers and springs in 
series.  We characterize this in the input by shear  moduli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and decay constants, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.  
The viscoelastic behavior is optional and an arbitr ary number of terms may be used. *
