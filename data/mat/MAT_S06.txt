 tive (compressive) displacement or rotation and end ing with the most positive 
(tensile) value.  The curves need not be symmetrica l. 
The displacement origin of the “unloading” curve is  arbitrary, since it will be 
shifted as necessary as the element extends and con tracts.  On reverse yielding 
the “loading” curve will also be shifted along the displacement re or.  rotation 
axis.   
2.  Initial Tensile and Compressive Yield Forces.   The initial tensile and 
compressive yield forces (TYI and CYI) deﬁne a rang e within which the ele- 
ment remains elastic (meaning the “loading” curve i s used for both loading 
and unloading).  If at any time the force in the el ement exceeds this range, the 
element is deemed to have yielded, and at all subse quent times the “unload- 
ing” curve is used for unloading. 
3.  Rotational Displacement.   Rotational displacement is measured in radians.
