EPS0 Quasi-static threshold strain rate (see Remark 1 ).  Ideally, this 
value represents the highest strain rate for which no rate 
adjustment to the ﬂow stress is needed and is input  in units of 
[time]−|oneCst.  For example, if strain rate eﬀects on the ﬂow st ress ﬁrst 
become apparent at strain rates greater than 10 −|twoCst s−|oneCst, and the 
system of units for the model input is {kg, mm, ms} , then EP SO 
should be set to 10 -5.

NUMINT Number of through thickness integration points which must fail 
before the shell element is deleted.  If zero, all integration points 
must fail (the default).  Since nodal ﬁber rotation s limit strains at 
active integration points, we do not recommend the default 
because elements undergoing large strain are often not deleted 
using this criterion.  Better results may be obtain ed when NU-
MINT is set to 1 or a number less than one half of the number of 
through thickness points.  For example, if four thr ough thickness 
points are used, NU MINT should not exceed 2, even for fully 
integrated shells which have 16 integration points.

Remarks: 
1.  Flow Stress.   Johnson and Cook express the ﬂow stress as 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst=|parenleftCv3|u1D434 + |u1D43J|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst/u1D45B.sts|parenriµhtCv3(1 + |u1D436 ln |u1D7≠≠̇∗)|parenleftCv11 − |u1D447∗|u1D4JACst|parenriµhtCv1  , 
where 
|u1D434, |u1D43J, |u1D436, |u1D4JB, and |u1D4JA =  input constants 
|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst=  effecti v e plastic strain 
|u1D7≠≠̇∗

EPS0 for V P = 0 (normali zed effecti v e total strain rate)

EPS0 for V P =  1 (normali zed effecti v e plastic strain rate) *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-195 (MAT) option is not strictly a spall model since the devi atoric stresses are un- 
aﬀected by the pressure reaching the tensile cutoﬀ and the pressure cutoﬀ 
value |u1D4JDmin  remains unchanged throughout the analysis.   
b)  Maximum Principal Stress Model.  The maximum principal stress spall 
model detects spall if the maximum principal stress , |u1D7≠∆max , exceeds the lim- 
iting value |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst.  Once spall in solids is detected with this model , the devia- 
toric stresses are reset to zero, and no hydrostati c tension is permitted.  If 
tensile pressures are calculated, they are reset to  0 in the spalled material.  
Thus, the spalled material behaves as rubble.  
c)  Hydrostatic Tension Model.  The hydrostatic tension spall model detects 
spall if the pressure becomes more tensile than the  speciﬁed limit, |u1D4JDmin .  
Once spall in solids is detected with this model, t he deviatoric stresses are 
set to zero, and the pressure is required to be com pressive.  If hydrostatic 
tension is calculated, then the pressure is reset t o 0 for that element. 
4.  Shell Element Deletion Based on Time Step.  This material model also 
supports a shell element deletion criterion based o n the maximum stable time 
step size for the element, ∆|u1D461max  (see DTF on Card 1).  Generally, ∆|u1D461max  goes 
down as the element becomes more distorted.  To ass ure stability of time inte- 
gration, the global LS-DYNA time step is the minimu m of the ∆|u1D461max  values 
calculated for all elements in the model.  Using th is option allows the selective 
deletion of elements whose time step, ∆|u1D461max , has fallen below the speciﬁed min- 
imum time step, ∆|u1D461crit .  Elements which are severely distorted often indic ate 
that material has failed and supports little load, but these same elements may 
have very small time steps and, therefore, control the cost of the analysis.  This 
option allows these highly distorted elements to be  deleted from the calcula- 
tion, and, therefore, the analysis can proceed at a  larger time step, and, thus, at 
a reduced cost.  Deleted elements do not carry any load and are deleted from 
all applicable slide surface deﬁnitions.  Clearly, this option must be judiciously 
used to obtain accurate results at a minimum cost. 
5.  Optional Strain Rate Forms.   The standard Johnson-Cook strain rate term is 
linear in the logarithm of the strain rate (see Remark 1 ): 
1 + |u1D436 ln |u1D7≠≠̇∗ 
You can replace this term by setting RATEOP > 0.  T hese additional rate forms 
are currently available for solid and shell element s but only when the visco- 
plastic rate option is active (VP = 1).  If VP is s et to zero, RATEOP is ignored. 
The ﬁrst additional available rate form enables som e additional data ﬁtting by 
using the quadratic form proposed by Huh & Kang [20 02]: 
1 + |u1D436 ln |u1D7≠≠̇∗+ |u1D436|twoCst(ln |u1D7≠≠̇∗)|twoCst *. .

An equation of state (*EOS) is optional for solid e lements, tshell formulations 3 and 5, 
and 2D continuum elements.  It is invoked by settin g EOSID to a nonzero value in 
*PART.  If an equation of state is used, only the d eviatoric stresses are calculated by the 
material model, and the pressure is calculated by t he equation of state.
