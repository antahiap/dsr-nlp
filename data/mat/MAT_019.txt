LS-DYNA R13 2-211 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LC1 Load curve ID deﬁning the yield strength |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst as a function of the 
eﬀective strain rate. 
ETAN Tangent modulus, |u1D438|u1D461Cst 
LC2 Optional load curve ID deﬁning Young’s modulus as a  function 
of the eﬀective strain rate (available only when VP  = 0; not 
recommended). 
LC3 Load curve ID deﬁning tangent modulus as a function  of the 
eﬀective strain rate (optional) 
LC4 Load curve ID deﬁning von Mises stress at failure a s a function of 
the eﬀective strain rate (optional) 
TDEL Minimum time step size for automatic element deleti on.  Use for 
shells only. 
RDEF Redeﬁnition of failure curve: 
EQ.1.0:  eﬀective plastic strain 
EQ.2.0:  maximum principal stress and absolute value of 
minimum principal stress 
EQ.3.0:  maximum principal stress (R5 of version 971) 
Remarks: 
1.  Yield Stress.   In this model, a load curve is used to describe t he yield strength 
|u1D7≠∆|zeroCst as a function of eﬀective strain rate |u1D7≠≠̅̇ where 
|u1D7≠≠̅̇= |parenleftCvJ2
3|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2
 
and the prime denotes the deviatoric component.  Th e strain rate is available 
for post-processing as the ﬁrst stored history vari able.  If the viscoplastic op- 
tion is active, the plastic strain rate is output; otherwise, the eﬀective strain rate 
deﬁned above is output.   
The yield stress is deﬁned as 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅̇|parenriµhtCv1 + |u1D438|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst  , 
where |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain and |u1D438|u1D4JDCst is given in terms of Young’s mod- 
ulus and the tangent modulus by *
