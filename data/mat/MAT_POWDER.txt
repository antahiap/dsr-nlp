Remarks: 
This model is intended to be used in two stages.  D uring the ﬁrst step the compaction of 
a powder specimen is simulated after which the resu lts are dumped to ﬁle, and in a 
subsequent step the model is restarted for simulati ng sintering of the compacted 
specimen.  In the following, an overview of the two  diﬀerent models is given, for a 
detailed description we refer to Brandt (1998).  Th e progressive stiﬀening in the material 
during compaction makes it more or less necessary t o run double precision and with 
constraint contacts to avoid instabilities, unfortu nately this currently limits the use of 
this material to the smp version of LS-DYNA. 
 
The powder compaction model makes use of a multipli cative split of the deformation 
gradient into a plastic and elastic part according to 
/u1D405=/u1D405|u1D4J2Cst/u1D405|u1D4JDCst  , 
where the plastic deformation gradient maps the ini tial reference conﬁguration to an 
intermediate relaxed conﬁguration 
|u1D6FF/u1D431̃=/u1D405|u1D4JDCst|u1D6FF/u1D41ℜ 
and subsequently the elastic part maps this onto th e current loaded conﬁguration 
|u1D6FF/u1D431=/u1D405|u1D4J2Cst|u1D6FF/u1D431̃  . 
The compactness tensor, /u1D40F, then maps the intermediate conﬁguration onto a vi rtual 
fully compacted conﬁguration 
|u1D6FF/u1D431̅=/u1D40F|u1D6FF/u1D431̃ 
and we deﬁne the relative density as 
|u1D4J1 = det /u1D40F=|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+̅  , 
where |u1D7≠+ and |u1D7≠+̅ denote the current and fully compacted density, re spectively.  The elastic 
properties depend highly on the relative density th rough the bulk modulus |u1D43∆(|u1D4J1) , but 
the Poisson’s ratio is assumed constant.

 smoothness in the plastic ﬂow direction and to avoi d numerical problems at the tensile 
cap point.  The above equations are for illustrativ e purposes, from now on the plastic 
ﬂow direction is generalized to a second order tens or.  The plastic ﬂow rule is then 
ε̇|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠6̇/u1D42ℜ|u1D7≠≠Cst, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JACst=1

The evolution of the compactness tensor is directly  related to the evolution of plastic 
strain as 
/u1D40Ḟ= −1
2|parenleftCv2ε̇|u1D4JDCst/u1D40F+/u1D40Fε̇|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2  , 
and thus, the relative density is given by 
|u1D4J1̇= −3|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JACst|u1D4J1 . 
The back stress is assumed coaxial with the deviato ric part of the compactness tensor 
and given by 
κ=/u1D4:D|oneCst/u1D4:B(|u1D4J2)|parenleftCvJ/u1D40F−Tr (/u1D40F)
3/u1D408|parenriµhtCvJ , 
where |u1D4J2 is a measure of intensity of anisotropy.  This tak es a value between 1 and 2 and 
evolves with plastic strain and plastic work accord ing to 
/u1D486̇=/u1D450|u1D44∆Cst/radical.v51

where 
/u1D44A(|u1D4J1,/u1D4:D|oneCst) = − |<racketleftCvJ/u1D4:D|oneCst
/u1D44B(|u1D4J1)|<racketriµhtCvJ|u1D4JDCst

3/u1D̅0∫/u1D451.st
/u1D451.st|zeroCsts|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0∫ 
and |u1D4J1|zeroCst is the density in the initial uncompressed conﬁgur ation.  The stress update is 
completed by the rate equation of stress 
/u1D̅48̇=/u1D402(|u1D4J1):|parenleftCv2ε̇−ε̇|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2  , 
where /u1D402(|u1D4J1) is the elastic constitutive matrix. 
 
The sintering model is a thermo and viscoelastic mo del where the evolution of the mean 
and deviatoric stress can be written as 
|u1D7≠∆̇|u1D4JACst= 3|u1D43∆|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JACst− |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D447Cst− |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JACst|parenriµhtCv2

The thermal strain rate is given by the thermal exp ansion coeﬃcient as 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D447Cst= |u1D6F+|u1D447̇  , 
and the bulk and shear modulus are the same as for the compaction model with the 
exception that they are scaled by a temperature cur ve *
