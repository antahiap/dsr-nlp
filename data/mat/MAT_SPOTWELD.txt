Remarks: 
1.  Failure Model Overview.  Spot weld material is modeled with isotropic 
hardening plasticity coupled to failure models.  EF AIL speciﬁes a failure strain 
which fails each integration point in the spot weld  independently.  The OPT 
parameter is used to specify a failure criterion th at fails the entire weld element 
when the criterion is met.  Alternatively, EFAIL an d OPT may be used to initi- 
ate damage when the DAMAGE-FAILURE option is active  using RS, BETA, 
and DMGOPT as described below. 
Beam spot weld elements can use any OPT value excep t 7.  Brick spot weld 
elements can use any OPT value except 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 , and -9.  Hex assembly spot 
welds can use any OPT value except 9 and -9. 
For all OPT failure criteria, if a zero is input fo r a failure parameter on Card 2, 
the corresponding term will be omitted from the equ ation.  For example, if for 
OPT = 0, only /u1D441|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JFCst/u1D439.sts is nonzero, the failure surface is reduced to |/u1D441|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JFCst | =/u1D441|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JFCst/u1D439.sts (see 
below). 
Similarly, if the failure strain EFAIL is set to ze ro, the failure strain model is not 
used.  Both EFAIL and OPT failure may be active at the same time. *.   
 5.  Yield Curve or Table for SIGY.   When using a yield curve or table for SIGY, a 
simpliﬁed plasticity algorithm is used, assuming a linear behavior within one 
time increment.  Thus, no iterative return mapping has to be performed. 
6.  Damage.  When the DAMAGE-FAILURE option is invoked, the cons titutive 
properties for the damaged material are obtained fr om the undamaged materi- 
al properties.  The amount of damage evolved is rep resented by the constant, 
|u1D714, which varies from zero if no damage has occurred to unity for complete 
rupture.  For uniaxial loading, the nominal stress in the damaged material is 
given by  
|u1D7≠∆nominal =|u1D443
|u1D434 
where |u1D443 is the applied load and |u1D434 is the surface area.  The true stress is given 
by:  
|u1D7≠∆true =|u1D443
|u1D434 − |u1D434loss  
where |u1D434loss  is the void area.  The damage variable can then be  deﬁned: 
|u1D714 =|u1D434loss 
|u1D434  , 
where 
0 ≤ |u1D714 ≤ 1  . 
In this model, damage is initiated when the eﬀectiv e plastic strain in the weld 
exceeds the failure strain, EFAIL.  If DMGOPT = 10,  11, or 12, damage will 
initiate when the eﬀective plastic strain exceeds E FAIL, or when the failure 
criterion is met, whichever occurs ﬁrst.  The failu re criterion is speciﬁed by the 
OPT parameter.  If the inputted value of EFAIL = 0 and DMGOPT = 10, 11, or 
12, then damage will only be initiated if the failu re criterion is met.  After dam- 
age initiates, the damage variable is evaluated by one of two ways: 
a)  For DMGOPT = 0, 1, 10, or 11, the damage variable is a function of eﬀec- 
tive plastic strain in the weld: 
|u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCst≤ |u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst≤ |u1D7≠≠rupture |u1D4JDCst⇒|u1D714 =|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst− |u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠rupture |u1D4JDCst− |u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCst   , 
where |u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCst = EFAIL and |u1D7≠≠rupture |u1D4JDCst = RS.  If DMGOPT = 10 or 11, and dam- 
age initiates by the failure criterion, then |u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCstis set equal to the eﬀective 
plastic strain in the weld at the time of damage in itiation. 
b)  For DMGOPT = 2 or 12, the damage variable is a fun ction of time: 
|u1D461failure ≤ |u1D461 ≤ |u1D461rupture ⇒|u1D714 =|u1D461 − |u1D461failure 
|u1D461rupture  *.   
 For weld elements in an assembly (see RPBHX on *CON TROL_SPOTWELD_-
BEAM or *DEFINE_HEX_SPOTWELD_ASSEMBLY), the failure  criterion is 
evaluated using the assembly cross section.  If dam age is not active, all ele- 
ments will be deleted when the failure criterion is  met.  If damage is active, 
then damage is calculated independently in each ele ment of the assembly.  By 
default, elements of the assembly are deleted as da mage in each element is 
complete.  If ASFF = 1, then failure and deletion o f all elements in the assembly 
will occur simultaneously when damage is complete i n any one of the ele- 
ments. 
8.  TRUE_T.   Weld elements and weld assemblies are tied to the  mid-plane of 
shell materials and so typically have a thickness t hat is half the sum of the 
thicknesses of the welded shell sections.  As a res ult, a weld under shear load- 
ing can be subject to an artiﬁcially large moment w hich will be balanced by 
normal forces transferred through the tied contact.   These normal forces will 
cause the out-of-plane bending moment used in the f ailure calculation to be 
artiﬁcially high.  Inputting a TRUE_T that is small er than the modeled thick- 
ness, for example, 10%-30% of true thickness will s cale down the moment or 
stress that results from the balancing moment and p rovide more realistic fail- 
ure calculations for solid elements and weld assemb lies.  TRUE_T eﬀects only 
the failure calculation, not the weld element behav ior.  If TRUE_T = 0 or data is 
omitted, the modeled weld element thickness is used .  For OPT = 0 (see below), 
the two out-of-plane moments, |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D46≠Cst  and |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst|u1D461Cst  are replaced by modiﬁed terms 
|u1D44≠/circum⨂lexcmb.h2|u1D46≠Cst|u1D46≠Cst  and |u1D44≠/circum⨂lexcmb.h2|u1D461Cst|u1D461Cst , as shown below: 
|<racketleftCv6max(/u1D441|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JFCst , 0)

|u1D44≠/circum⨂lexcmb.h2|u1D46≠Cst|u1D46≠Cst = |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D46≠Cst −/u1D441|u1D4JFCst|u1D461Cst (|u1D461 − |u1D461true )
|u1D44≠/circum⨂lexcmb.h2|u1D461Cst|u1D461Cst = |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst|u1D461Cst −/u1D441|u1D4JFCst|u1D46≠Cst (|u1D461 − |u1D461true ) 
In the above, |u1D461 is the element thickness and  |u1D461true  is the TRUE_T parameter.  For 
OPT = 1 (see below), the same modiﬁcation is done t o the moments that con- 
tribute to the normal stress, as shown below: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JFCst =/u1D441|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JFCst 
|u1D434+/radical.v2|u1D44≠/circum⨂lexcmb.h2|u1D46≠Cst|u1D46≠Cst |twoCst+ |u1D44≠/circum⨂lexcmb.h2|u1D461Cst|u1D461Cst |twoCst
|u1D44D  . 
9.  TTOPT .  In LS-DYNA version 971R9, a modiﬁcation to the TR UE_T behavior 
was made to address a condition of weld elements th at are tied to shell ele- 
ments of signiﬁcantly diﬀerent stiﬀness.  This chan ge had unintended eﬀects 
on the behavior of weld failure, so a new option, T TOPT, was added to revert 
the behavior of TRUE_T to that of R8 and earlier ve rsions.  The default behav- 
ior of TTOPT is to continue with the new calculatio n but setting TTOPT = 1 
will cause the earlier method to be used.  Setting TTOPT = 2 will invoke 
TTOPT = 1 plus a change to make the welds invariant  with respect to solid 
element node numbering.  By default, failure is cal culated using forces on the *.   
 Alternatively, a *DEFINE_FUNCTION could be used to deﬁne the Weld Failure for 
OPT = 0. Then set FVAL = function ID. Such a functi on could look like this: 
*DEFINE_FUNCTION 
        100 
 func(nrr,nrs,nrt,mrr,mss,mtt)= (nrr/5.0)*(nrr/5.0)  
 
The six arguments for this function (nrr, …, mtt) a re the force and moment resultants 
during the computation. 
OPT = 1: 
OPT = 1 invokes a stress based failure model, which  was developed by Toyota Motor 
Corporation  and is based on the peak axial and transverse shea r stresses.  The weld fails 
if the stresses are outside of the failure surface deﬁned by 
|parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JFCst 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JFCst |u1D439Cst|parenriµhtCvJ|twoCst
+|parenleftCv4/u1D̅0F
/u1D̅0F|u1D439Cst|parenriµhtCv4|twoCst
− 1 = 0 
If strain rates are considered, then the failure cr iteria becomes: 
|<racketleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JFCst 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JFCst |u1D439Cst(|u1D7≠≠̇eff )|<racketriµhtCvJ|twoCst
+|<racketleftCvJ/u1D̅0F
/u1D̅0F|u1D439Cst(|u1D7≠≠̇eff )|<racketriµhtCvJ|twoCst
− 1 = 0 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JFCst |u1D439Cst(|u1D7≠≠̇eff ) and /u1D̅0F|u1D439Cst(|u1D7≠≠̇eff ) are deﬁned by load curves (SIGAX and SIGTAU are le ss 
than zero).  The peak stresses are calculated from the resultants using simple beam 
theory: n1n4n5n8

based failure is used orientation is very important.  No des n1  - n4 attach to the 
lower shell mid-surface and nodes n5 - n8 attach to the up per shell mid -
surface.  The resultant forces and moment s are computed based on the 
assumption that the brick element is properly oriented. *.   
 OPT = 4 
OPT = 4 invokes failure based on structural stress intensity, see Zhang [1999].  Failure 
occurs when the failure criterion: 
|u1D43∆e q − |u1D43∆e q F ≥ 0 
is satisﬁed where 
|u1D43∆e q =/radical.v2|u1D43∆/u1D4:C.st|twoCst+ |u1D43∆/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st|twoCst

Here, |u1D439 and |u1D44≠ are as deﬁned above for the notch stress formulas and again, |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst (|u1D4J6 =
1, 2, 3 ) are input corrections factors with default values  of unity.  If spot welds are 
between sheets of unequal thickness, the minimum th ickness of the spot welded sheets 
may be used as a crude approximation. 
 
The maximum structural stress at the spot weld was utilized successfully for predicting 
the fatigue failure of spot welds, see Rupp, et.  a l . [1994] and Sheppard [1993].  The 
corresponding results from] Rupp, et.  al. are list ed below where it is assumed that they 
may be suitable for crash conditions. 
OPT = 5 
OPT = 5 invokes failure by 
max(|u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst|twoCst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst|threeCst) − |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst|u1D439Cst = 0  , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst|u1D439Cst  is the critical value of structural stress at fail ure.  It is noted that the forces 
and moments in the equations below refer to the bea m node 1, beam node 2, and the 
midpoint, respectively.  The three stress values, |u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst|twoCst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst|threeCst, are deﬁned by:

eroded.  
Remarks: 
1.  Loading Solid Welds Uniaxially. We have implemented two methods of 
loading solid and solid weld assemblies uniaxially.   The older method is in- 
voked by deﬁning the elastic modulus, |u1D438, as a negative number where the ab- 
solute value of |u1D438 is the desired value for |u1D438.  This uniaxial option causes the two 
transverse stress terms to be assumed to be zero th roughout the calculation.  
This assumption eliminates parasitic transverse str ess that causes slow growth 
of plastic strain-based damage.  
The other method is invoked by setting OPTION  to UNIAXIAL. This method is 
preferred.  It causes the two transverse stress ter ms and the two transverse 
strains terms to be set to zero.  It was added beca use we found that the older 
method sometimes induced spurious oscillations in t he axial force, leading to 
premature failure.  
The motivation for the uniaxial options can be expl ained with a weld loaded in 
tension.  Due to Poisson’s eﬀect, an element in ten sion would be expected to 
contract in the transverse directions.  However, be cause the weld nodes are *. _DAIMLERCHRYSLER  
 6.  Deactivating Weld Failure.  An option to deactivate weld failure is switched 
on by setting CON_ID to a negative value where the absolute value of CON_-
ID becomes the connection ID.  When weld failure is  deactivated, the failure 
function is evaluated and output to swforc  and dcfail , but the weld retains its 
full strength. *. . On *SECTION_SOLID, set ELFORM  =  1.
