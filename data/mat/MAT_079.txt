 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
K0 Bulk modulus at the reference pressure 
P0 Cut-oﬀ/datum pressure.  P0 is irrelevant if |u1D43J=|u1D4341=|u1D4342=0. 
Otherwise, P0 must be < 0 (meaning tensile); a very small 
negative value is acceptable.     Below this pressu re, stiﬀness and 
strength go to zero.  This is also the “zero” press ure for pressure-
varying properties. 
B Exponent for the pressure-sensitive elastic modul i, |u1D44F.  See 
Remarks .  B must be in the range 0 ≤ |u1D43J < 1 , and values too close 
to 1 are not recommended because the pressure becom es 
indeterminate.

Remarks: 
The elastic moduli G and K are pressure sensitive: 
|u1D43A|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1 =|u1D43A|zeroCst|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD − |u1D4JD|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D44FCst
|parenleftCv1|u1D4JDref − |u1D4JD|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D44FCst 
|u1D43∆|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1 =|u1D43∆|zeroCst|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD − |u1D4JD|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D44FCst
|parenleftCv1|u1D4JDref − |u1D4JD|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D44FCst 
In the above |u1D43∆|zeroCst is an input value, |u1D4JD is the current pressure, |u1D4JD|zeroCst is the cut-oﬀ or datum 
pressure (must be zero or negative), and |u1D43A|zeroCst is the initial shear modulus at small shear 
strain: 
|u1D43A|zeroCst= SFLC ×/u1D̅0F|oneCst
|u1D6F∆|oneCst  . 
In the above (/u1D̅0F|oneCst, |u1D6F∆|oneCst) is the ﬁrst (nonzero) point in LCID. Therefore, |u1D43A|zeroCst represents the 
total of the elastic slopes of all the layers. 
 
If |u1D4JD falls below |u1D4JD|zeroCst (meaning becomes more tensile), the shear stresses  are set to zero and 
the pressure is set to |u1D4JD|zeroCst.  Thus, the material has no stiﬀness or strength i n tension.  The 
pressure in compression is calculated as follows: 
|u1D4JD = |u1D4JD/r.st|eCst /f.st|<racketleftCvJ−|u1D43∆|zeroCst
|u1D4JD/r.st|eCst /f.stln(|u1D449) |<racketriµhtCvJ|oneCst(|oneCst−|u1D44FCst)/fraction.v2
 
where |u1D449 is the relative volume, that is, the ratio between  the original and current 
volume.  This formula results in an instantaneous b ulk modulus that is proportional to 
|u1D4JD|u1D44FCst whose value at the reference pressure is equal to |u1D43∆|zeroCst(1 − |u1D44F) ⁄ . 
 
The stress-strain pairs deﬁne a shear stress as a f unction of shear strain curve.  The ﬁrst 
point on the curve is assumed by default to be (0,0)  and does not need to be entered.  
The slope of the curve must decrease with increasin g |u1D6F∆.  This curve applies at the 
reference pressure; at other pressures, the curve i s scaled by *.  uses the following deﬁnitions: 
• Input shear stress is treated by the material mod el as, Figure M79-1.  Family of stress- strain curves.  The curve labeled total 
represents LCID × SFLC. The other curves represent one “layer” in the 
material model.

For a particular stress or strain state (deﬁned by the relationship between the three 
principal stresses or strains), a scaling factor ma y be needed in order to convert between 
the deﬁnitions given above and the shear stress or strain that an engineer would expect.

caused by the soil particles having to climb over e ach other to develop shear strain. |u1D6F∆/g.st 
describes compaction of the soil due to collapse of  weak areas and voids, caused by 
continuous shear straining.

Strain rate sensitivity: 
Strain rate eﬀect is accounted for by scaling the y ield stress of each layer as the user-
speciﬁed strain rate eﬀect is accounted for by scal ing the yield stress of each layer as the 
user-speciﬁed function of plastic strain rate.  The  stress-strain curve deﬁned by LCID is 
for quasi-static loading.  Scale factor (on the |u1D466-axis) as a function of strain rate (on the |u1D46J-
axis) is deﬁned in curve LCSR. All scale factors mu st be equal to or larger than 1.0.  
Because the rate enhancement factor applies to the strength but not the stiﬀness, and is 
calculated separately for each layer, an overall en hancement factor between 1.0 and the 
value in LSCR will be observed in situations where not all the layers are yielding.  
Cyclic degradation: 
Cyclic degradation is accounted for by reducing the  size of all yield surfaces 
proportionally based on the accumulation of the dam age strain.  The strength reduction 
factor, |u1D4J3, is determined by the following equation: 
|u1D4J3 = 1 − (1 −Σ|u1D44JCst) |parenleftCv61 − |u1D4J2−/u1D̅12.st/u1D6FE.st/u1D451.sts

where Σ is the shear stress ratio (deﬁned as current shear  stress divided by shear 
strength at the current pressure); Σ|u1D44JCst is the residual shear strength ratio SIGR; /u1Dℜ12 is the 
input parameter CHI; and |u1D6F∆/u1D451.st is the damage strain, deﬁned as the summation of *
