This is Material Type 101. The GEPLASTIC_SRATE_2000 a material model characterizes 
General Electric's commercially available engineeri ng thermoplastics subjected to high 
strain rate events.  This material model features t he variation of yield stress as a 
function of strain rate, cavitation eﬀects of rubbe r modiﬁed materials, and automatic 
element deletion of either ductile or brittle mater ials.

LCSS Load curve ID or table ID that deﬁnes the post yiel d material 
behavior.   The values of this stress- strain curve are the diﬀerence 
of the yield stress and strain, respectively.  This  means th e ﬁrst 
values for both stress and strain should be zero.  All subsequent 
values will deﬁne softening or hardening. *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCFEPS Load curve ID that deﬁnes the plastic failure strai n as a function 
of strain rate 
LCFSIG Load curve ID that deﬁnes the maximum p rincipal failure stress 
as a function of strain rate 
LCE Load curve ID that deﬁnes the unloading moduli as a  function of 
plastic strain 
Remarks: 
The constitutive model for this approach is: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠̇|zeroCstexp /˙raceleft.v2|u1D434/˙racketleft.v2|u1D7≠∆ − |u1D446|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2/˙racketright.v2/˙raceright.v2× exp|parenleftCv1−|u1D4JD|u1D6F+|u1D434|parenriµhtCv1 
where |u1D7≠≠̇|zeroCst and |u1D434 are rate dependent yield stress parameters, |u1D446|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 is the internal 
resistance (strain hardening), and |u1D6F+ is a pressure dependence parameter. 
 
In this material the yield stress may vary througho ut the ﬁnite element model as a 
function of strain rate and hydrostatic stress.  Po st yield stress behavior is captured in 
material softening and hardening values.  Finally, ductile or brittle failure measured by 
plastic strain or maximum principal stress, respect ively, is accounted for by automatic 
element deletion. 
 
Although this may be applied to a variety of engine ering thermoplastics, GE Plastics 
have constants available for use in a wide range of  commercially available grades of 
their engineering thermoplastics. *
