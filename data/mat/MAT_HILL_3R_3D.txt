  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
point |u1D4JD in space and the global location of the element 
center; this is the |u1D44∆-direction. 
EQ.2.0: globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
the vectors /u1D41A and /u1D41D, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR. 
EQ.3.0: locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector /u1D42F with the 
element normal. 
EQ.4.0: locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, /u1D42∫, which deﬁne the centerline ax- 
is. 
LT.0.0: the absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR).

 If |u1D439 = |u1D43A =/u1D4:B, and, /u1D4:F= |u1D44≠ =/u1D441= 3|u1D439 , the Hill criterion reduces to the Von-Mises 
criterion. 
The strain hardening in this model can either deﬁne d by the load curve or by 
Swift’s exponential hardening equation: |u1D7≠∆yield =/u1D458(|u1D7≠≠ + 0.01)|u1D4JBCst. 
2.  Applications.   This material model is suitable for metal forming  application 
using solid elements to account for anisotropic pla sticity.  NUMISHEET con- 
ferences have provided material constants of Hill’s  1948 yield for many com- 
monly used materials.   
It can also be applied to multi-scale simulations o f ﬁberglass and laminated 
materials, according to CYBERNET SYSTEMS CO., LTD.  The elastic coeﬃ- 
cients can be calibrated analytically by a homogeni zation method with tensile 
tests in the three orthogonal directions and three pure shear tests in the three 
orthogonal planes. 
3.  Material Parameter Calibration.  The six material parameters required can be 
calibrated with nonlinear regression analysis (such  as those available through 
LS-OPT) through a series of tensile tests in three orthogonal directions and 
three shear tests in three orthogonal planes. 
Revision information:
