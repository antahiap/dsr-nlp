  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
PHPLANE Friction angle for shear behavior on plane (degrees) 
TPLANE Tensile strength across plane (generally zer o or very small) 
SHRMAX Max shear stress on plane (upper limit, independent  of 
compression) 
LOCAL Axes: 
EQ.0: DIP and DIPANG are with respect to the global axes.  
EQ.1: DIP and DI PANG are with respect to the local element 
axes. 
Remarks: 
1.  Mohr Coulomb Yield Surface.   This material has a Mohr Coulomb yield 
surface, given by  
/u1D̅0Fmax = |u1D436 + |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCsttan (P H I)  , 
where /u1D̅0Fmax  is the maximum shear stress on any plane, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst is the normal stress 
on that plane (positive in compression), |u1D436 is the cohesion, and PHI is the fric- 
tion angle.  The plastic potential function is of t he form  
|u1D6FD|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J8Cst− |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst+ constant, 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J8Cst is the maximum principal stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst is   the minimum principal stress, 
and 
|u1D6FD =1 + sin(PSI)
1 − sin(PSI)  . 
2.  Depth-Dependent Properties.   If depth-dependent properties are used (see 
GMODDP, GMODGR, CVALGR), the model must be oriented  with the /u1D46̅-axis 
in the upward direction. 
3.  Plastic Strain.   Plastic strain is deﬁned as 
/radical.v52
3|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   , 
that is, the same way as for other elasto-plastic m aterial models. 
4.  Plastic Strain Adjustments.  Friction and dilation angles PHI and PSI may 
vary with plastic strain.  To model heavily consoli dated materials under large 
shear strains, as the strain increases, the dilatio n angle typically reduces to zero 
and the friction angle reduces to a lower, pre-cons olidation value. *.

global |u1D44D-axis. 
12.  Masonry and Joint Planes.   Joint planes would generally be deﬁned in the 
global axis system if they are taken from survey da ta and the material repre- 
sents rock.  However, the material model can also b e used to represent mason- 
ry, in which case the weak planes represent the mor tar joints; if these joints lie 
parallel to the local element axes, set LOCAL = 1. 
13.  Rigid Body Motion.   The joint planes rotate with the rigid body motio n of the 
elements, irrespective of whether their initial deﬁ nitions are in the global or 
local axis system.
