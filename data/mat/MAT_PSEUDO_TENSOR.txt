1 Error associated with advection inherently leads t o state variables that may be inconsistent with 
nonlinear constitutive routines and thus may lead t o nonphysical results, nonconservation of energy, a nd 
even numerical instability in some cases.  Caution is advised, particularly when using the 2 nd  tier of 
material models implemented for ALE multi-material solids (designated by [8B]) which are largely 
untested as ALE materials.

This is  Material Type 16.  This model has been used to anal yze buried steel reinforced 
concrete structures subjected to impulsive loadings . 
This model can be used in two major modes - a simpl e tabular pressure-dependent 
yield surface and a potentially complex model featu ring two yield as a function of 
pressure functions with the means of migrating from  one curve to the other.  These 
modes are discussed in detail in the Remarks sectio n.  For both modes, load curve LCP 
is taken to be a strain rate multiplier for the yie ld strength.  Note that this model must 
be used with equation-of-state type 8, 9 or 11.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
YS n Yield stress (Mode I) or scale factor (Mode II.B or  II.C) 
Remarks: 
1.  Response Mode I (Tabulated Yield Stress as a Functi on of Pressure).  This 
model is well suited for implementing standard geol ogic models like the 
Mohr-Coulomb yield surface with a Tresca limit, as shown in Figure M16-1 .  *.   
2-202 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 2.  Response Mode II (Two Curve Model with Damage and F ailure).   This 
approach uses two yield versus pressure curves of t he form  
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D44∆|zeroCst+|u1D4JD
|u1D44∆|oneCst+ |u1D44∆|twoCst|u1D4JD 
The upper curve is best described as the maximum yi eld strength curve and 
the lower curve is the failed material curve.  Ther e are a variety of ways of 
moving between the two curves and each is discussed  below. 
a)  Mode II.A (Simple Tensile Failure).   To use this mode, deﬁne |u1D44∆|zeroCst, |u1D44∆|oneCst, |u1D44∆|twoCst, |u1D44∆0f , 
and |u1D44∆1f , set |u1D44F|oneCst to zero, and leave Cards 4 through 7 blank.  In th is case the 
yield strength is taken from the maximum yield curv e until the maximum 
principal stress ( |u1D7≠∆|oneCst) in the element exceeds the tensile cutoﬀ ( |u1D7≠∆cut ). When 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst> |u1D7≠∆cut  is detected, the yield strength is scaled back by a fraction of the 
distance between the two curves in each of the next  20 time steps so that 
after those 20 time steps, the yield strength is de ﬁned by the failure curve. 
b)  Mode II.B (Tensile Failure plus Plastic Strain Scal ing).   Deﬁne |u1D44∆|zeroCst, |u1D44∆|oneCst, |u1D44∆|twoCst, |u1D44∆0f , 
and |u1D44∆1f , set |u1D44F|oneCst to zero, and use Cards 4 through 7 to deﬁne a scal e factor, |u1D7≠2, 
(Cards 6 and 7) as a function of eﬀective plastic s train (Cards 4 and 5).  LS-
DYNA evaluates |u1D7≠2 at the current eﬀective plastic strain and then ca lculates 
the yield stress as 
|u1D7≠∆yield = |u1D7≠∆failed + |u1D7≠2(|u1D7≠∆max − |u1D7≠∆failed ) , 
where |u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst|xCst  and |u1D7≠∆failed  are found as shown in Figure M16-2 .  This yield 
strength is then subject to scaling for tensile fai lure as described above.  
This type of model describes a strain hardening or softening material, 
such as concrete. PressureYield

2-204 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 lus, shear modulus, and yield strength are then cal culated from a simple mix- 
ture rule.  For example, for the bulk modulus the r ule gives: 
|u1D43∆ = |parenleftCv11 − |u1D4J3|u1D4JFCst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D43∆|u1D4JACst+ |u1D4J3|u1D4JFCst|u1D43∆|u1D4JFCst  , 
where |u1D43∆|u1D4JACst and |u1D43∆|u1D4JFCst are the bulk moduli for the geologic material and the rein- 
forcement material, respectively.  This feature sho uld be used with caution.  It 
gives an isotropic eﬀect in the material instead of  the true anisotropic material 
behavior.  A reasonable approach would be to use th e mixture elements only 
where the reinforcing exists and plain elements els ewhere.  When the mixture 
model is being used, the strain rate multiplier for  the principal material is tak- 
en from load curve N1 and the multiplier for the re inforcement is taken from 
load curve N2. 
5.  Suggested Parameters.   The LLNL DYNA3D manual from 1991 [Whirley 
and Hallquist] suggests using the damage function ( Mode II.C) in Material 
Type 16 with the following set of parameters: 
|u1D44∆|zeroCst=|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst
4 
|u1D44∆|oneCst=1
3 |u1D44∆|twoCst=1
3|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst 
|u1D44∆|zeroCst/u1D45:.st=|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst
10  |u1D44∆|oneCst/u1D45:.st=1.5 
|u1D44F|oneCst=1.25

This set of parameters should give results consiste nt with Dilger, Koch, and 
Kowalczyk [1984] for plane concrete.  It has been s uccessfully used for rein- 
forced structures where the reinforcing bars were m odeled explicitly with em- 
bedded beam and shell elements.  The model does not  incorporate the major 
failure mechanism - separation of the concrete and reinforcement leading to 
catastrophic loss of conﬁnement pressure.  However,  experience indicates that 
this physical behavior will occur when this model s hows about 4% strain. *
