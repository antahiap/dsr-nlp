This is Material Type 136_2017, a plane stress orth otropic material model for metal 
forming.  It features the advanced Vegter yield loc us based on the interpolation by 
second-order Bezier curves.  Model parameters are d etermined from uniaxial test data 
at 0°, 45° and 90° to the rolling direction.  There fore, the same mechanical tests must be 
carried out as for Hill’s 1948 planar anisotropic m aterial model.  For a more detailed 
description of the yield locus, please see Vegter a nd Boogaard [2006].  The relationships 
between the results of uniaxial testing and the adv anced yield locus are introduced and 
discussed in Abspoel et al [2017].
