The ORTHO option invokes an orthotropic damage mode l, an extension that was ﬁrst 
added as for modelling failure in aluminum panels.  Directional damage begins after a 
deﬁned failure strain is reached in tension and con tinues to evolve until a tensile 
rupture strain is reached in either one of the two orthogonal directions.  After rupture is 
detected at all  integration points, the element is deleted.   
The ORTHO_RCDC option invokes the damage model deve loped by Wilkins [Wilkins, 
et al.  1977].  The ORTHO_RCDC1980 option invokes a  damage model based on strain 
invariants as developed by Wilkins [Wilkins, et al.   1980].  A nonlocal formulation, 
which requires additional storage, is used if a cha racteristic length is deﬁned.  The 
RCDC option, which was added at the request of Toyo ta, works well in predicting 
failure in cast aluminum; see Yamasaki, et al., [20 06].

Load Curve.   When LC SS is a load curve ID, it is taken as

deﬁned, EPS1 - EPS8 and ES1 - ES8 are ignored. 
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the stress as a function eﬀect ive plastic strain 
for that rate; see Figure M24-1 .  When the strain rate falls below 
the mi nimum value, the stress as a function of eﬀective p lastic 
strain curve for the lowest value of strain rate is  used.  Likewise,

Remarks: 
1.  The stress strain behavior may be treated by a bil inear stress strain curve by 
deﬁning the tangent modulus, ETAN.  Alternately, a curve similar to that 
shown in Figure M24-1  is expected to be deﬁned by (EPS1, ES1) - (EPS8, E S8); 
however, an eﬀective stress versus eﬀective plastic  strain curve (LCSS) may be 
input instead if eight points are insuﬃcient.  The cost is roughly the same for 
either approach.  The most general approach is to u se the table deﬁnition (LC-
SS) discussed below. 
Three options to account for strain rate eﬀects are  possible: 
a)  Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model 
which scales the yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|sixCst/fraction.v2
 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate, |u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
If the viscoplastic option is active, VP = 1.0, and  if SIGY is > 0, then the 
dynamic yield stress is computed from the sum of th e static stress, 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2, which is typically given by a load curve ID, and the initial yield 
stress, SIGY, multiplied by the Cowper-Symonds rate  term as follows: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 + SIG Y × |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst
|u1D436|parenriµhtCv6|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  , 
where the plastic strain rate is used.  With this l atter approach similar re- 
sults can be obtained between this model and materi al model: *. -082  *. -082  
 where |u1D443 is the applied load and |u1D434 is the surface area.  The true stress is given 
by:  
|u1D7≠∆true =|u1D443
|u1D434 − |u1D434loss  
where |u1D434loss  is the void area.  The damage variable can then be  deﬁned: 
|u1D714 =|u1D434loss 
|u1D434 
such that 
0 ≤ |u1D714 ≤ 1. 
In this model, unless LCDM is deﬁned, damage is deﬁ ned in terms of eﬀective 
plastic strain after the failure strain is exceeded  as follows: 
|u1D714 =|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst− |u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠rupture |u1D4JDCst− |u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCst , |u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCst≤ |u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst≤ |u1D7≠≠rupture |u1D4JDCst 
After exceeding the failure strain, softening begin s and continues until the rup- 
ture strain is reached. 
3.  Rc-Dc Model.  The damage, |u1D437, for the Rc-Dc model is given by: 
|u1D437 =/integral.v:|u1D714|oneCst|u1D714|twoCst|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst 
where |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain,  
|u1D714|oneCst= |parenleftCvJ1
1 − |u1D6F∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JACst|parenriµhtCvJ/u1D6FC.st
 
is a triaxial stress weighting term and

 ing the element itself, and let /divides.v:|u1D438/u1D45:.st|u1D4J9Cst/divides.v: be the number of elements in that set.  The 
norm of the gradient of damage is estimated roughly  as 
‖∇|u1D437‖/u1D45:.st≈1
/divides.v:|u1D438/u1D45:.st|u1D4J9Cst/divides.v:|summationCv1|dividesCv2|u1D437|u1D4J2Cst− |u1D437/u1D45:.st|dividesCv2
|u1D4J1|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45:.st|u1D4J2Cst∈|u1D438Cst/u1D45:.sts/u1D4⃡9.sts 
where |u1D4J1|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45:.st is the distance between element |u1D4J3 and |u1D4J2. 
The reason for taking the ﬁrst approach is that it should be a better approxima- 
tion of the gradient; it can for one integration po int in each element be seen as a 
weak gradient of an elementwise constant ﬁeld.  The  memory consumption as 
well as computational work should not be much highe r than for the other ap- 
proach. 
The RCDC1980 model is identical to the RCDC model e xcept the expression for 
|u1D434/u1D4:̅.stis in terms of the principal stress deviators and t akes the form
