LS-DYNA R13 2-395 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
The load curve is deﬁned in the positive quadrant, that is, 
positive values of |u1D6F∆ are deﬁned as negative values on the 
abscissa. 
Remarks: 
A rigid, low density, closed cell, polyurethane foa m model developed at Sandia 
Laboratories [Neilsen, Morgan and Krieg 1987] has b een recently implemented for 
modeling impact limiters in automotive applications .  A number of such foams were 
tested at Sandia and reasonable ﬁts to the experime ntal data were obtained. 
 
In some respects this model is similar to the crush able honeycomb model type 26 in that 
the components of the stress tensor are uncoupled u ntil full volumetric compaction is 
achieved.  However, unlike the honeycomb model this  material possesses no 
directionality but includes the eﬀects of conﬁned a ir pressure in its overall response 
characteristics. 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst s k − |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠∆air   , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst s k  is the skeletal stress and |u1D7≠∆air  is the air pressure.  |u1D7≠∆air  is computed from the 
equation: 
|u1D7≠∆air = −|u1D4JD|zeroCst|u1D6F∆
1 + |u1D6F∆ −/u1D̅1∫  , 
where |u1D4JD|zeroCst is the initial foam pressure, usually taken as the  atmospheric pressure, and |u1D6F∆ 
deﬁnes the volumetric strain  
|u1D6F∆ = |u1D449 − 1 + |u1D6F∆|zeroCst  . 
Here, |u1D449 is the relative volume, deﬁned as the ratio of the  current volume to the initial 
volume, and |u1D6F∆|zeroCst is the initial volumetric strain, which is typical ly zero.  The yield 
condition is applied to the principal skeletal stre sses, which are updated independently 
of the air pressure.  We ﬁrst obtain the skeletal s tresses: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst s k = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst + |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠∆air  
and compute the trial stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst s k t  
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst s k t  = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst s k + |u1D438 |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  ∆|u1D461  , 
where |u1D438 is Young’s modulus.  Since Poisson’s ratio is zero , the update of each stress 
component is uncoupled and 2|u1D43A = |u1D438  where |u1D43A is the shear modulus.  The yield 
condition is applied to the principal skeletal stre sses such that, if the magnitude of a 
principal trial stress component, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Csts k t , exceeds the yield stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst, then *
