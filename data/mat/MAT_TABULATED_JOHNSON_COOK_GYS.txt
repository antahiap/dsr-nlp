This is  Material Type 224_GYS. This is an isotropic elastic  plastic material law with a J3 
dependent yield surface.  This material considers t ensile/compressive asymmetry in the 
material response, which is important for HCP metal s like Titanium.  The model is 
available for solid elements. 
Available options include: 
<BLANK> 
LOG_INTERPOLATION 
With LOG_INTERPOLATION, the strain rate eﬀect in ta ble LCK1 (Card 2) is 
interpolated with logarithmic interpolation.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
E Young’s modulus: 
GT.0.0: Constant value is used. 
LT.0.0: Temperature dependent Young’s modulus given by 
load curve ID = -E 
PR Poisson’s ratio 
CP Speciﬁc heat 
TR Room temperature 
BETA Fraction of plastic work converted into heat (super seded by 
FWORK in *CONTROL_THERMAL_ SOLVER if a coupled 
thermal/structural analysis): 
GT.0.0: Constant value is used. 
LT.0.0: - BETA gives a load curve ID for strain rate depend- 
ence, a table ID for strain rate and temperature de - 
pendence, a 3- dimensional table ID for temperature 
(TABLE_3D), strain rate (TABLE) and plastic strain 
(CURVE) dependence, or a 4- dimensional table ID for 
triaxiality (TABLE_4D), temperature (TABLE_ 3D), 
strain rate (TABLE) and plastic strain (CURVE) de- 
pendence. 
NUMINT Number of integration points which must fail before  the element 
is deleted. 
EQ.-200: Turns oﬀ erosion for solids.  Not recommended 
unless used in conjunction with *CONSTRAINED_-
TIED_NODES_FAILURE. 
LCK1 Table ID deﬁning for each plastic strain rate value  a load curve ID 
giving the (isothermal) eﬀective stress as a fu nction of eﬀective 
plastic strain for that rate. 
LCKT Table ID deﬁning for each temperature value a load curve ID 
giving the (qu asi- static) eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀective *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
IFLAG Flag to specify abscissa for LCCR, LCCT, LCSR , LCST: 
EQ.0: Compressive and shear yields are given as functions  of 
plastic strain as deﬁned in Remark 1  (default). 
EQ.1: Compressive and shear yield s are given as functions of 
eﬀective plastic strain. 
SFIEPM Scale factor on the initial estimate of the plastic multiplier 
NITER Number of secant iterations to be performed 
Remarks: 
1.  IFLAG. If IFLAG = 0, the compressive and shear curves are deﬁned as follows:
