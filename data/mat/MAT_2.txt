which applies a smoothing algorithm to reduce outpu t noise level of the strain ratio |u1D6FD

The NLP_FAILURE option uses eﬀective plastic strain  to calculate the onset of necking, 
which assumes the necking happens in an instant.  H owever, necking may occur over a 
longer duration which the option NLP2 is developed to address.  NLP2 calculates the 
damage during forming and accumulates it to predict  the sheet metal failure.

 TBL_SS is also optional.  It overrides SIGY and the  stress-strain relationships 
from EC3. If present, TBL_SS must be the ID of a *D EFINE_TABLE.  The ﬁeld 
VALUE on the *DEFINE_TABLE should contain the tempe rature at which each 
stress-strain curve is applicable; the temperatures  should be in ascending or- 
der.  The curves that follow the temperature values  have plastic strain on the |u1D46J-
axis and yield stress on the |u1D466-axis as per other LS-DYNA elasto-plastic material 
models.  As with all instances of *DEFINE TABLE, th e curves containing the 
stress-strain data must immediately follow the *DEF INE_TABLE input data 
and must be in the correct order (that is, the same  order as the temperatures). 
3.  Temperature.  Temperature can be deﬁned by any of the *LOAD_THERM AL 
methods.  The temperature does not have to start at  zero: the initial tempera- 
ture will be taken as a reference temperature for e ach element, so non-zero 
initial temperatures will not cause thermal shock e ﬀects. 
4.  Extra History Variables.  Temperature is output by this material model as 
Extra History Variable 1. This can be useful for ch ecking the input in cases 
where temperature varies across the diﬀerent integr ation points, as is the case 
with *LOAD_THERMAL_VARIABLE_BEAM  Figure M202-1.   Stress-Strain Curves at various temperatures 0.02 0.00 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0.20 0.18 0.160.00.20.40.60.81.01.2

Remarks: 
Reinforcement is treated as bars, acting independen tly in the local material |u1D46J and |u1D466 
directions.  By default, the local material |u1D46J-axis is the element |u1D46J-axis (parallel to the line 
from Node 1 to Node 2), but this may be overridden using AOPT or Element Beta 
angles.  
 
For shell elements, the reinforced concrete section  should be deﬁned using *PART_-
COMPOSITE with some integration points being reinfo rcement (referencing a Material 
ID using this material model) and others being conc rete (using for example *. 03  *MAY_HYSTERETIC_REINFORCEMENT

The input parameters should be given in model units , e.g. DBAR and LCHAR are in 
model length units, FCDOW is in model stress units.   These will be converted internally 
using UNITL and UNITC.  
Element erosion: 
By default, no erosion occurs.  Elements will be de leted only if EPDAM1 and EPDAM2 
are non-zero, and DRESID is zero, and the accumulat ed plastic strain reaches EPDAM2. 
If FRACX and FRACY are both non-zero, i.e. if there  is reinforcement in both local 
directions, then elements are eroded only when the condition above has been reached in 
both local directions. 
Output: 
The output stresses, as for all other LS-DYNA mater ial models, are by default in the 
global coordinate system.  They are scaled by the r einforcement fractions FRACX, FRA-
CY. The plastic strain output is the accumulated pl astic strain (increments always 
treated as positive), and is the greater such value  of the two local directions.  Extra 
history variables are available as follows: 
 
Extra variable 1:  Reinforcement stress in local |u1D46J direction (not scaled by FRACX) 
Extra variable 2:  Reinforcement stress in local |u1D466 direction (not scaled by FRACY)

 contact with a hard surface perpendicular to the su rface on which Node 2 
slides.  In that case, the limit distances, DMXPX, DMXNX, DMXPY, and 
DMXNY, represent the initial gap between the point (Node 2) and the hard 
surface. 
Optionally, an initial bond strength can be deﬁned.   The bond forces are in 
addition to any contact and friction forces.  After  breakage of the bond, con- 
tact and sliding can continue to occur. 
If LCZ is deﬁned, compressive loading in the contac t direction follows LCZ 
while unload/reload is linear with stiﬀness STIFF. The value of STIFF must 
not be less than the maximum slope of any segment o f the curve LCZ.  
You can also deﬁne moment stiﬀnesses through KROTX,  KROTY and 
KROTZ. Optionally, these stiﬀnesses can be set to b ecome active at a certain 
time (TKROT).  If TKROT is nonzero, the moment stiﬀ ness will be zero be- 
fore that time and during any dynamic relaxation.  If TKROT is left zero, the 
moment stiﬀness will be active from the start of th e analysis including dur- 
ing dynamic relaxation.  
Damping is applied to the force normal to the surfa ce, to the bond forces, 
and to any forces generated by “hard limits” (LIMPX  etc.), but not to slid- 
ing.  Two damping methods are available: DAMP and D AMPZ/DAMPH. 
DAMP is recommended for general use where the exact  amount of damp- 
ing is unimportant, and the requirement is simply t o remove unwanted 
oscillations.  DAMPZ and DAMPH are available for ca ses where particular 
values of viscous damping coeﬃcient are required.  When LCZ is also de- 
ﬁned and the response is following the load curve ( meaning not during 
unloading/reloading), the damping coeﬃcient DAMPZ i s scaled to the ratio 
of the slope of LCZ to STIFF. The slope of LCZ is t he gradient at the current 
point on the load curve.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
HOLSHR Flag for hole enlargement due to shear (see Remark 5 ): 
EQ.0: Hole does not enlarge due to shear deformation. 
NE.0: Shear deformation after bolt contacts the inner dia meter 
of the hole enlarges the hole.   
Remarks: 
1.  Bolted Joint Geometry.   The element represents a bolted joint. The nodes of 
the beam should be thought of as representing the p oints at the centers of the 
holes in the plates that are joined by the bolt.  W e recommend using 
SCOOR = -13 or +13 on *SECTION_BEAM. 
The axial direction is initially the line connectin g node 1 to node 2. The axial 
response is tensile only.  Instead of generating a compressive axial load, a gap 
is assumed to develop between the bolt head (or nut ) and the surface of the 
plate.  Contact between the bolted surfaces must be  modelled separately using 
*CONTACT. 
2.  Yield Force Curves.  Curves LCAX and LCSHR give yield force as a functi on 
of plastic displacement for the axial and shear dir ections, respectively.  The 
force increments are calculated from the elastic st iﬀnesses, subject to the yield 
force limits given by the curves. 
3.  Sliding Shear Displacement.   CLEAR allows the bolt to slide in shear, 
resisted by friction between bolt head/nut and the surfaces of the plates, from 
the initial position at the center of the hole.  CL EAR is the total sliding shear 
displacement before contact occurs between the bolt  shank and the inside sur- 
face of the hole.  Sliding shear displacement is no t included in the displace- 
ment used for LCSHR; LCSHR is intended to represent  the behavior after the 
bolt shank contacts the edge of the hole. 
4.  Shear Deformation and Axial Tension.   If KSHR and LCSHR represent 
deformation and rotation of the bolt itself, the de fault setting AXSHFL = 0 is 
recommended.  On the other hand, if KSHR and LCSHR represent deformation 
of the bearing surfaces, AXSHFL = 1 is recommended.   
The explanation is as follows.  Consider the case w here a shear displacement is 
applied to the bolted joint, while the plates are c onstrained to remain the same 
distance apart.  Mechanisms by which a bolted joint  can displace in the shear 
direction include: 
a)  the bolt sliding within a clearance gap;  *. 08

|u1D439|zeroCst Input parameter F0 on Card 3  (see Remark 3 )  
3.  Force Offset . The input parameter F0 oﬀsets the yield surface p arallel to the 
axial force axis.  It is the axial force at which t he maximum bending moment 
capacity occurs and is treated as tensile if F0 is positive, or compressive if F0 is 
negative.  The same axial force oﬀset F0 is used fo r both the local axes ( |u1D46≠ and |u1D461). 
For steel components, the value of F0 is usually ze ro.  For reinforced concrete 
components, F0 should be input as negative, corresp onding to the compressive 
axial force at which the moment capacities are maxi mum.

deﬁning the shape of the axial-moment yield surface .  When ALPHA and BE-

 as “fatigue-type” hysteretic behavior, where all pl astic cycles contribute to the 
degradation.  In the axial direction, plastic defor mation is accumulated sepa- 
rately for tensile and compressive deformations. 
If IHARD = 2, 3 or 4, the abscissa represents the p eak absolute value of the 
plastic deformation.  This quantity increases only when the absolute value of 
plastic deformation exceeds the previously recorded  maximum.  This option 
can be described as “high-tide” hardening behavior and follows the FEMA 
approach. In particular, IHARD of 3 and 4 reproduce  the yield-oriented and 
peak-oriented hysteresis, respectively, as shown be low. 
 
 
7.  Pinching.   Pinched-shape hysteresis loops are seen in experi ments on 
reinforced concrete members. They are caused by sti ﬀness changes due to 
cracks opening and closing.  This eﬀect on the ﬂexu re response may be simu- 
lated using input parameter PINM. The default, PINM  = 1.0, gives no pinch- 
ing.  The pinch points are given by moments and rot ations illustrated in the 
schematic below. Input parameter PINS has the same eﬀect on shear hysteresis IHARD = 2 IHARD = 3 IHARD = 4

 The force or moment for component |u1D46J|u1D46J , |u1D439|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.stactual , is calculated as:  
|u1D439|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.stactual = (1 − |u1D437|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst )(1 − |u1D437FEMA )|u1D439|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.st  nominal   . 
|u1D46J|u1D46J  can be AT for axial tension, AC for axial compress ion, MS for bending about 
the |u1D46≠-axis, MT for bending about the |u1D461-axis.  Here, |u1D439|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.stnominal  is the force or mo- 
ment calculated in the absence of damage for compon ent |u1D46J|u1D46J . |u1D437|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst  is the compo- 
nent-speciﬁc damage fraction for component xx , and |u1D437FEMA  is the damage 
calculated from passing FEMA thresholds (see Remark 11 ). 
The component-speciﬁc damage may be deﬁned to be de pendent on cumula- 
tive plastic deformation, on peak deformation, or a  combination of both: 
|u1D437|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst (|u1D461) = 1 − |<racketleftCv61 − |u1D714|oneCst|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst ∆|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4JDCst|u1D4J2Cst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J8Cst 
∆|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D462Cst|u1D4J9Cst|u1D461Cst |<racketriµhtCv6|u1D7≠6Cst|oneCsts
|<racketleftCv61 − |u1D714|twoCst|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst ∆|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D462Cst|u1D4JACst 
∆|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D462Cst|u1D4J9Cst|u1D461Cst |<racketriµhtCv6|u1D7≠6Cst|twoCsts
 . 
Here |u1D714|oneCst|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst are |u1D714|twoCst|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst are the input parameters OMGxx1 and OMGxx2. ∆|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.stpea k  is 
the peak deformation (i.e., axial displacement, axi al strain or rotation depend- 
ing on xx  and IAX) that has occurred to date; ∆|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.staccum  is the accumulated plas- 
tic deformation; and ∆|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.stult  is the input parameter DUAT, DUAC, RUMS or 
RUMT. |u1D7≠6|oneCst and |u1D7≠6|twoCst are the input parameters LAM1 and LAM2. Setting th ese to 
zero disables dependence on peak deformation and cu mulative plastic defor- 
mation, respectively. 
The damage |u1D437FEMA  is calculated using input parameters SOFT1 and SOF T2, 
taking the most damaged component including shear a s well as axial and mo- 
ment components.  For example, if SOFT1 = 3 and SOF T2 = 4, and the most 
damaged component has reached a FEMA index of 3.25 (meaning one quarter 
of the way from threshold 3 to threshold 4), then |u1D437FEMA = 0.25 . 
By default, no element erosion occurs.  If SOFT1 an d SOFT2 are non-zero, then 
an element is deleted if |u1D437FEMA  reaches zero.  
10.  Shear Behavior.  Nonlinear shear behavior is controlled using input 
parameters LCSHS, LCSHT, SFSHS and SFSHT. By defaul t, the shear yield 
surface is independent of the yield surface for axi al and ﬂexure and takes the 
following form: 
/u1D̅1:|u1D46≠Cst= |parenleftCv6|u1D449|u1D46≠Cst
|u1D449|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst |parenriµhtCv6|twoCst
+ |parenleftCv6|u1D449|u1D461Cst
|u1D449|u1D466Cst|u1D461Cst |parenriµhtCv6|twoCst
− 1  . 
Here, |u1D449|u1D46≠Cst and |u1D449|u1D461Cst are the current shear forces in the local |u1D46≠- and |u1D461-directions. |u1D449|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst  
and |u1D449|u1D466Cst|u1D461Cst  are the current yield shear forces in the local |u1D46≠- and |u1D461-directions 
The shear yield forces are functions of plastic she ar strain (that is, shear angle). 
The plastic shear strain can be either peak or cumu lative, depending on *. 09

Remarks: 
1.  SPR Geometry.  “Head” is the end of the SPR that fully perforates a sheet.  
“Tail” is the end that is embedded within the thick ness of a sheet.   
The sheet planes are deﬁned at the head by the quad rilateral deﬁned by nodes 
N1-N2-N3-N4 of the solid element; and at the tail b y the quadrilateral deﬁned 
by nodes N5-N6-N7-N8.  It is essential that the nod es N1 to N4 are ﬁxed to the 
head sheet (e.g. by direct meshing or tied contact) : the element has no stiﬀness 
to resist relative motion of nodes N1 to N4 in the plane of the head sheet.  Simi- 
larly, nodes N5 to N8 must be ﬁxed to the tail shee t 
The tail of the SPR is deﬁned as a point in the tai l sheet plane, initially at the 
center of the element face.  The head of the SPR is  initially at the center of the 
head sheet plane.  The SPR axis is deﬁned as the li ne joining the tail to the 
head.  Thus, the axis of the SPR would typically be  coincident with the solid 
element local /u1D46̅-axis if the solid is a cuboid.  It is the user’s r esponsibility to 
ensure that each solid element is oriented correctl y. 
During the analysis, the head and tail will always remain in the plane of the 
sheet but may move away from the centers of the she et planes if the shear forc- 
es in these planes are suﬃcient. 
2.  Young’s Modulus and Poisson’s Ratio.   E and PR are used only to calculate 
contact stiﬀness.  They are not used by the materia l model. 
3.  Axes.   Deformation is in length units and is on the |u1D46J-axis.  Force is on the |u1D466-
axis.  Rotation is in radians on the |u1D46J-axis.  Moment is on the |u1D466-axis. 
4.  Load Curve Assumptions.   All the load curves are expected to start at (0,0) . 
“Deformation” means the total deformation including  both elastic and plastic 
components, similarly for rotation. 
5.  “High Tide” Algorithm.   A “high tide” algorithm is used to determine the 
deformation or rotation to be used as the |u1D46J-axis of the load curves when look- 
ing up the current yield force or moment.  The “hig h tide” is the greatest dis- 
placement or rotation that has occurred so far duri ng the analysis. *. 11  
 13.  Initial Softening Displacements/Rotations.   If the inputs DFAXH, DFSHH, 
RFBMH, DFAXT, DFSHT, and RFBMT are non-zero, these values must be 
within the abscissa values of the relevant curve, s uch that the curve 
force/moment value is greater than zero at the deﬁn ed start of softening.   
If the inputs are left blank or zero, they will be calculated internally as follows: 
a)  Final failure will occur at the displacement or ro tation (DFAIL) at which 
the load curve reaches zero (determined, if necessa ry, by extrapolation 
from the last two points). 
b)  Displacement or rotation at which softening begins  is then back-
calculated.  For example, DFAXT = DFAIL (1 + DMGAXT) ⁄ . 
c)  If DMGAXT is left blank or zero, it defaults to 0. 1. 
d)  If the load curve does not drop to zero, and the ﬁ nal two points have a ze- 
ro or positive gradient, no failure or softening wi ll be caused by that dis- 
placement component. 
14.  Output Stress.   Output stresses (in the d3plot  and time-history output ﬁles) 
are set to zero.  
15.  Displacement Ratio.   The output variable “displacement ratio” (or rota tion 
ratio for bending), |u1D44J, is deﬁned as follows.  See also the Figure M211-1 . 
a)  |u1D44J = 0.0 to 1.0 .  The maximum force or moment on the input curve h as not 
yet been reached. |u1D44J is proportional to the maximum force or moment Displacement

An element is eroded if |u1D4J1 reaches a value of 1.0 for s olid elements.  
For shell elements, an element is eroded if |u1D4J1|oneCst reaches a value of 
1.0 since only the in-plane mode of failure is cons idered [ 9]. |u1D4JB is 
not required for shell elements.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
BETA13 Decay constant for the relaxation matrix of the vis coelastic law 13-
coupling (default = (BETA11 +BETA33 )2⁄). This ﬁeld is not 
required for shell elements.  It must be greater th an or equal to 
zero. 
CP Speciﬁc heat capacity (per unit mass) 
TQC Taylor-Quinney Coeﬃcient  
TEMP This is the reference (or initial) temperature used  to obtain the 
corresponding stress-strain curves. 
PMACC Plastic multiplier computational accuracy (se e Remark 10 ): 
EQ.0:  Use up to a maximum of 1000 increments (default) 
EQ.N:  Specify a positive value, N, greater than 1 as the 
maximum number of increments.  An error message is 
issued if a converged solution cannot be found. 
Remarks: 
1.  Flow Rule Coefﬁcients.   Flow rule coeﬃcients (FRC) are determined using 
the plastic Poisson’s ratios [ 1, 2, 3]. Details on how to compute FRCs can be 
found in [ 8]. 
2.  Temperature-Strain Rate Test Result Tables.   A minimum of two sets of 
(strain rate-temperature) curves are needed.  If th e material is not temperature 
and rate sensitive, make the two sets of table data  identical.  If the material is 
rate and temperature sensitive, the curve correspon ding to the smallest total 
strain rate for the given reference temperature (TE MP in Card 10) is assumed 
to be the quasi-static, room temperature (QS-RT) cu rve and inﬂuences the vis- 
coelastic-plastic computations. 
An example TABLE_3D (LT i) structure for 3 total strain rates and 3 tempera-
tures for tension in the |u1D44∆-direction test is shown below.  The total strain r ates *. 13 cards used in a speciﬁc model.  For instan ce, if the LT10-LT11-
LT12 combination is tension-compression-compression  for one set

 3.  YSC.  Curve of initial yield strain values (YSC) must lis t curves in ascending 
order as abscissa values with the corresponding yie ld strains given as the ordi- 
nate values.  An example YSC data is shown below fo r a case with two sets of 
(temperature, strain rate) data.

 5.  Failure Criterion.   Use Cards 8 n.1 and 8 n.2 for the failure criterion to be included 
in the failure model.  The failure criterion and as sociated values are given as (see 
[5] for details) 
a)  Puck Failure Criterion (PFC).  For this criterion, FTYPE = 1 and FV0, …, 
FV14 are the magnitudes of fracture energy, damage,  magniﬁcation factor, 
slope parameters, and material parameters for the ﬁ ber. 
b)  Tsai-Wu Failure Criterion (TWFC) .  For this criterion, FTYPE = 2 and FV1, 
..., FV12 are the magnitudes of the failure stresse s |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst |u1D447Cst , |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst /u1D4:6.st, |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst |u1D447Cst, |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst /u1D4:6.st, |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst |u1D447Cst, 
|u1D7≠∆̂|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst /u1D4:6.st, |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst , |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst , |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J≠Cst ,  |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst |fourCst|fiveCst , |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst |fourCst|fiveCst , and |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J≠Cst |fourCst|fiveCst .  
c)  Generalized Tabulated Failure Criterion (GTFC) . For solid elements with 
FTYPE = 3, FV1 is |u1D4JB, the in-plane and out-of-plane interaction term.  FV2 
and FV3 are the Table IDs of the two tables for the  in-plane and the out-of-
plane (/u1D̅0:, |u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J9Cst ) values that deﬁne the in-plane and out-of-plane fa ilure sur- 
faces, respectively.  For the in-plane failure surf ace, the table contains the 
|u1D44∆-direction stress (S11) value-curve ID pairs.  For the out-of-plane failure 
surface, the table contains the normal /u1D450-direction stress (S33) value-curve 
ID pairs.  For shell elements, only FV2 is used wit h the preceding deﬁni- 
tion and the element fails when the damage is 1. Th ere is no data in card 
8d.2. 
A partial example is shown below for solid elements .

 9.  Poisson’s Ratios.   If necessary, the input Poisson’s ratios are adju sted 
internally in LS-DYNA to satisfy the criteria descr ibed in [ 6]. 
10.  Plastic Multiplier. The plastic multiplier computations involve ﬁnding the root 
of the yield function.  The root is computed numeri cally, not analytically.  The 
ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd the interval bounding the root.   The value of N set in ﬁeld 
PMACC on Card 10 controls the discretization of the  interval to ﬁnd the 
bound.  The larger the value of N, the more accurat e the bound.  However, the 
computational time is likely to increase with large r values of N. 
11.  Stochastic Variation.   A stochastic variation can be added using keyword  
*DEFINE_STOCHASTIC_VARIATION_PROPERTIES. There are six quantities 
(see table below) which can be varied, so Card 2 in  *DEFINE_STOCHASTIC_-
VARIATION_PROPERTIES must be deﬁned six times and a ssumes that the 
quantities being varied are in the order speciﬁed.

12.  Damage Formulation.  By default, the damage calculations are carried ou t 
using eﬀective stress as the internal state variabl e for tracking growth of dam- 
age parameters |u1D4J1|u1D4J≠Cst /u1D451.st |u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst . An alternate formulation is available where the d amage 
parameters are taken as functions of directional pl astic strains to track damage 
growth.  Details of both the formulations are avail able in [ 10 ].

EAFAIL Erosion strain in longitudinal direction (se e Figure M214-1 ): 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D44∆Cst/co⋯⋯a.stfail  
EBFAIL Erosion strain in transverse direction (see Figure M214-1 ): 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D44FCst/co⋯⋯a.stfail  
Remarks: 
1.  Strain Rate Effects.   Strain rate eﬀects are accounted for using a Cowp er-
Symonds model which scales the stress according to the strain rate: 
/u1D6D4ad j=/u1D6D4|parenleftCvJ1 +|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D443Cst  . 
In the above equation /u1D6D4 is the quasi-static stress, /u1D6D4ad j is the adjusted stress ac- 
counting for strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇, and |u1D436 (CCE) and |u1D443 (PCE) are the Cowper-Symonds 
factors which must be determined experimentally for  each material. 
The model captures the non-linear strain rate eﬀect s in many materials.  With 
its less than unity exponent, 1/|u1D4JD, this model captures the rapid increase in ma- 
terial properties at low strain rate, while increas ing less rapidly at very high 
strain rates.  Because stress is a function of stra in rate the elastic stiﬀness also 
is: 
/u1D404ad j=/u1D404|parenleftCvJ1 +|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D443Cst 
where /u1D404ad j is the adjusted elastic stiﬀness.  Additionally, t he strains to peak and 
strains to failure are assumed to follow a Cowper-S ymonds model with, possi- 
bly diﬀerent , constants 
|u1D7≠≠ad j=ε|parenleftCvJ1 +|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|u1D46≠Cst|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D443Cst/u1D460.sts  , 
where, |u1D7≠≠ad j is the adjusted eﬀective strain to peak stress or strain to failure, and 
|u1D436|u1D46≠Cst and |u1D443|u1D46≠Cst are CSE and PSE respectively. 
2.  Stress-Strain beyond Peak Stress.   When strained beyond the peak stress, 
the stress decreases linearly until it attains a va lue equal to SIGPOST, at which 
point the stress-strain relation becomes nonlinear.   In the non-linear region the 
stress is given by 
|u1D7≠∆ =  |u1D7≠∆post

gle BETA. BE TA may be set in the keyword input for 
the element or in the input for this keyword.  Note  that 
for solids, the material axes may be switched depen d-

fore or after applying BE TA depending on the value of

Material Orientation: 
Figure 4 of Reference 13  shows the 2nd order orientation tensor for which t here are 
eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues.  The co ordinate system based on the 
eigenvectors is the material coordinate system.  Th e values /u1D45E|oneCst|oneCst ,…, /u1D45E|threeCst|threeCst  for solids (history 
variables 11 through 16) and the values cos (|u1D6F+ ) and - sin |u1D6F+  for shells (history variables 11 
and 12) specify this material coordinate system wit h respect to the element coordinate 
system. The values |u1D44∆|oneCst and |u1D44∆|twoCst (A11 and A22 of history variables 9 and 10) shown in the 
ﬁgure represent the eigenvalues, or in other words,  the lengths of the ellipsoid.  Thus.  
history variables 9 and 10 give the shape of the el lipsoid while history variables 11 
through 16 give the orientation.

Phases: 
The material properties for each element are initia lized using the data for the ﬁrst 
phase.  After the center of the element passes thro ugh the transition plane deﬁned by 
the two points, the material properties are irrever sibly changed to the second phase. 
 
The plane is deﬁned by two points.  The ﬁrst point,  deﬁned by the coordinates X1, Y1, 
and Z1, lies on the plane.  The second point, deﬁne d by the coordinates X2, Y2, and Z2, 
deﬁne the exterior normal as a unit vector in the d irection from the ﬁrst point to the 
second point. *. 17  
 Alternatively, a BETA angle can be deﬁned for indiv idual solid elements as described in 
remark 5 for *ELEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO.  The beta angle by the ORTHO option is 
available for all values of AOPT, and it overrides the BETA angle on the *MAT card for 
AOPT = 3. 
 
The directions determined by the material AOPT opti ons may be overridden for 
individual elements as described in remark 3 for *E LEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO.  
However, be aware that for materials with AOPT = 3,  the ﬁnal {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} system will be 
the system deﬁned on the element card rotated about  /u1D41C-axis by the BETA angle speciﬁed 
on the *MAT card. 
 
There are two fundamental diﬀerences between shell and solid element orthotropic 
materials.  First, the /u1D41C-direction is always normal to a shell element such  that the /u1D41A-
direction and /u1D41B-directions are within the plane of the element.  S econd, for some 
anisotropic materials, shell elements may have uniq ue ﬁber directions within each layer 
through the thickness of the element so that a laye red composite can be modeled with a 
single element. 
 
When AOPT = 0 is used in two-dimensional planar and  axisymmetric analysis, it is 
critical that the nodes in the element deﬁnition be  numbered counterclockwise for this 
option to work correctly. 
 
Because shell elements have their /u1D41C-axes deﬁned by the element normal, AOPT = 1 and 
AOPT = 4 are not available for shells.  Also, AOPT = 2 requires only the vector /u1D41A be 
deﬁned since /u1D41D is not used.  The shell procedure projects the inp utted /u1D41A-direction onto 
each element surface. 
 
Similar to solid elements, the {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} coordinate system determined by AOPT is then 
modiﬁed by a rotation about the /u1D41C-axis which we will call /u1D̅1∫.  For those materials that 
allow a unique rotation angle for each integration point through the element thickness, 
the rotation angle is calculated by 
/u1D̅1∫|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D6FD + |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst 
where |u1D6FD is a rotation for the element, and |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst is the rotation for the i’th layer of the 
element.  The |u1D6FD angle can be input using the BETA parameter on the  *MAT data, or will 
be overridden for individual elements if the BETA k eyword option for *ELEMENT_-
SHELL is used.  The |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst angles are input using the ICOMP = 1 option of *SE CTION_-
SHELL or with *PART_COMPOSITE.  If |u1D6FD or |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst is omitted, they are assumed to be zero. 
 
All anisotropic shell materials have the BETA optio n on the *MAT card available for 
both AOPT = 0 and AOPT = 3, except for materials 91  and 92 which have it available for 
all values of AOPT, 0, 2, and 3. 
 
All anisotropic shell materials allow an angle for each integration point through the 
thickness, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst, except for materials 2, 86, 91, 92, 117, 130, 170,  172, and 194.   *. 18

 Formulation: 
The in-plane secant stiﬀness of the damaged laminat e is represented as the summation 
of the eﬀective contributions of the layers in the laminate as shown. 
/u1D400/u1D451.st= |summationCv1 |u1D461|u1D4J8Cst/u1D6BB|u1D4J8Cst/ε.st/u1D410|u1D4J8Cst/u1D451.st/u1D6BB|u1D4J8Cst 
where /u1D6BB|u1D4J8Cst is the transformation matrix for the strain vector , and /u1D410|u1D4J8Cst/u1D451.st is the in-plane secant 
stiﬀness of kth  layer in the principal orthotropic plane, and |u1D461|u1D4J8Cst is the thickness of the kth  
layer of an |u1D4JB-layered laminate. 
 
A physically-based and yet simple approach has been  employed here to derive the 
damaged stiﬀness matrix.  Two reduction coeﬃcients,  |u1D44J/u1D45:.st  and |u1D44J|u1D4JACst, that represent the 
reduction of stiﬀness in the longitudinal (ﬁber) an d transverse (matrix) directions have 
been employed.  The shear modulus has also been red uced by the matrix reduction 
parameter.  The major and minor Poisson’s ratios ha ve been reduced by |u1D44J/u1D45:.stand  |u1D44J|u1D4JACstre- 
spectively.  A sub-laminate-level reduction, |u1D44J|u1D43FCst, is incorporated to avoid spurious stress 
locking in the damaged zone.  This would lead to an  eﬀective reduced stiﬀness matrix 
/u1D410|u1D4J8Cst/u1D451.st. The reduction coeﬃcients are equal to 1 in the und amaged condition and gradually 
decrease to 0 for a saturated damage condition.

Damage Evolution: 
In CODAM2, the evolution of damage mechanisms is ex pressed in terms of equivalent 
strain parameters.  The equivalent strain function that governs the ﬁber stiﬀness 
reduction parameter is written in terms of the long itudinal normal strains by 
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J8Cste q = |u1D7≠≠|oneCst|oneCst /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J8Cst,/u1D458= 1, . . . , |u1D4JB 
The equivalent strain function that governs the mat rix stiﬀness reduction parameter is 
written in an interactive form in terms of the tran sverse and shear components of the 
local strain: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JACst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J8Cste q = sign|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|twoCst /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J8Cst|parenriµhtCv1/radical.v5|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|twoCst /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J8Cst|parenriµhtCv1|twoCst+ |parenleftCv4|u1D6F∆|oneCst|twoCst /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J8Cst

 parameters are deﬁned in Cards 6 and 7. Damage is c onsidered to be a monotonically 
increasing function of time, |u1D461, such that 
|u1D714/u1D6FC.st= max 
/t∙u.st<|tCst|parenleftCv1|u1D714/u1D6FC.st/u1D̅0F.st|parenriµhtCv1  , 
where |u1D714/u1D6FC.st|u1D461Cst is the value of |u1D714/u1D6FC.st for the current time (load state), and |u1D714/u1D6FC.st/u1D̅0F.st represents the state 
of damage at previous times /u1D̅0F≤ |u1D461. 
 
Damage is applied by scaling the layer stress by re duction parameters 
|u1D44J/u1D6FC.st= 1 − |u1D714/u1D6FC.st 
where |u1D6F+ = |u1D4J3 and |u1D6F+ = |u1D4JA .  The layer stresses are summed and then then scal ed by 
reduction parameter 
|u1D44J|u1D43FCst= 1 − |u1D714|u1D43FCst  . 
Figures M219-1  (a) and (b) show the relationship between the dama ge and reduction 
parameters 
 
If the parameter RESIDS > 0, damage in the layers i s limited such that 
|u1D44J/u1D45:.st= max|parenleftCv2RESIDS, 1 − |u1D714/u1D45:.st|parenriµhtCv2
|u1D44J|u1D4JACst= max(RESIDS, 1 − |u1D714|u1D4JACst) 
Element Erosion: 
When ERODE > 0, an erosion criterion is checked at each integration point.  Shell 
elements and thick shell elements will be deleted w hen the erosion criterion has been 
met at all integration points.  Brick elements will  be deleted when the erosion criterion 
is met at any of the integration points.  For ERODE  = 1, the erosion criterion is met 
when maximum principal strain exceeds either SLOCT × ERPAR1 for elements in 
tension, or SLOCC × ERPAR1 for elements in compression.  Elements are in tension εsεi1

or when all integrations points have failed. *. 21

shows a value of 1.0 for integration points that ex ceeded the limit, 
else a value of 0.0. 
Remarks: 
1.  Flow Stress. The ﬂow stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst is expressed as a function of plastic strain |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, 
plastic strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst and temperature |u1D447 through the following formula (using 
load curves/tables LCK1 and LCKT): 
|u1D46≠|u1D466Cst=/u1D458|oneCst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst)/u1D458|u1D461Cst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D447)
/u1D458|u1D461Cst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D447|u1D44JCst) 
Note that |u1D447|u1D44JCst is a material parameter and should correspond to t he temperature 
used when performing the room temperature tensile t ests.  If simulations are to 
be performed with an initial temperature TI deviating from |u1D447|u1D44JCst, then this tem- *. 24  
 3.  Failure Criterion. The default failure criterion of this material mode l depends 
on plastic strain evolution |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst and on plastic failure strain |u1D7≠≠pf  and is obtained by 
accumulation over time: 
|u1D439 =/integral.v:|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst /u1D45:.st|u1D4J1|u1D461 
where element erosion takes place when |u1D439 ≥ 1.  This accumulation provides 
load-path dependent treatment of failure.  The valu e of |u1D439 is stored as history 
variable #8 for shells and #12 for solids.   
An additional, load-path independent, failure crite rion can be invoked by set- 
ting FAILOPT = 1, where the current state of plasti c strain is used: 
|u1D439|twoCst=|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst /u1D45:.st 
Two additional parameters can be used as countermea sures against stress os- 
cillations for this failure criterion.  With NUMAVG  active, plastic failure strain 
is averaged over NUMAVG time steps for the |u1D439|twoCst criterion.  The value of |u1D439|twoCst, 
taking into account any averaging per NUMAVG, is st ored as history variable 
#14 for shells and #16 for solids.  NUMAVG cannot e xceed 30. NCYFAIL de- 
ﬁnes the number of time steps that |u1D439|twoCst≥ 1 must be met before element deletion 
takes place.  The number of time steps that |u1D439|twoCst≥ 1 is stored as history variable

If a coupled thermal/structural analysis is perform ed, temperatures from the 
thermal solver are used.  In that case, the plastic  work that is to be converted to 
hear is transferred to the thermal solver as additi onal volumetric heat source.  
If no dissipation factor is deﬁned, the value of FW ORK in *CONTROL_THER-
MAL_SOLVER is used.

For *CONSTRAINED_TIED_NODES_WITH_FAILURE, the failu re is based on 
the damage instead to the plastic strain.

additional variables.  The number of additional var iables for shells/solids writ- 
ten to the d3plot  and d3thdt  databases is input by the optional *DATABASE_-

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
plastic strain curve for the highest value of strai n rate is used if 
the strain r ate exceeds the maximum value.  NOTE: The strain 
rate values deﬁned in the table may be given as the  natural 
logarithm of the strain rate.  If the ﬁrst  stress- strain curve in the 
table corresponds to a negative strain rate, LS-DY NA assumes 
that the natu ral logarithm of the strain rate value is used.  Si nce 
the tables are internally discretized to equally sp ace the points, 
natural logarithms are necessary, for example, if t he curves 
correspond to rates from 10 -4 to 10 4.

 faces of this box may be open, as required by the g eometry of the problem.  For 
example, for a half-space problem, the “top” of the  box should be open. 
Internally, LS-DYNA will partition the entire PML i nto regions which form the 
“faces,” “edges” and “corners” of the above cuboid box, and generate a new 
material for each region.  This partitioning will b e visible in the d3plot  ﬁle.  The 
user may safely ignore this partitioning. 
4.  Number of Elements in Layer.   The layer should have 5-10 elements through 
its depth.  Typically, 5-6 elements are suﬃcient if  the excitation source is rea- 
sonably distant from the layer, and 8-10 elements i f it is close.  The size of the 
elements should be similar to that of elements in t he bounded domain near the 
layer, and should be small enough to suﬃciently dis cretize all signiﬁcant 
wavelengths in the problem. 
5.  Nodal Constraints.   The nodes on the outer boundary of the layer shou ld be 
fully constrained.

the MAGNESIUM option an alternative option for the hardening curve is available: von 
Mises eﬀective stress as a function of equivalent p lastic strain, which is energy 
conjugate to the von Mises stress. 
 
Finally, the MAGNESIUM option allows for distortion al hardening by providing 
hardening curves as measured in tension and compres sion tests.  This option is 
however incompatible with the activation of rate eﬀ ects (visco-plasticity). 
 
With the MAGNESIUM option this material model is al so available for solid elements. 
NOTE:  Activating the MAGNESIUM options requires  setting 
HR = 3 and FIT = 0.0 (also see below).

Hardening laws: 
The following hardening laws are implemented: 
1.  Swift hardening law 
2.  Voce hardening law 
3.  Gosh hardening law 
4.  Hocket-Sherby hardening law 
5.  Loading curve, where the yield stress is given as a function of the eﬀective 
plastic strain 
 
The Swift’s hardening law can be written as 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2 =/u1D45E|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|zeroCst+ |u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2|u1D4JBCst 
where /u1D45E and |u1D4JB are material parameters.  
The Voce’s equation says that the yield stress can be written in the following form 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst ep  
where |u1D44∆, |u1D44F, and /u1D450 are material parameters.  The Gosh’s equation is s imilar to Swift’s 
equation.  They only diﬀer by a constant 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2 =/u1D45E|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|zeroCst+ |u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2|u1D4JBCst− |u1D4JD  . 
Here /u1D45E, |u1D7≠≠|zeroCst, |u1D4JB and |u1D4JD are material constants.  The Hocket-Sherby equatio n resembles the 
Voce’s equation, but with an additional parameter a dded 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst ep /u1D45B.sts

where |u1D44∆, |u1D44F,/u1D450 and |u1D4JB are material parameters.

The classical elastic constitutive equation for lin ear deformations is the well-known 
Hooke’s law.  This relation written in a rate formu lation is given by

where ε|u1D4J2Cst is the elastic strain and /u1D40: is the constitutive matrix.  An over imposed dot

Implementation: 
Assume that the stress and strain is known at time |u1D461|u1D4JBCst. A trial stress σ/tilℂecomb.h1|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst at time |u1D461|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst is 
calculated by assuming a pure elastic deformation, that is, 
/u1D6D4/tilℂecomb.h1|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst=/u1D6D4|u1D4JBCst+/u1D40:|parenleftCv2ε|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst−ε|u1D4JBCst|parenriµhtCv2 (233.19) 
Now, if |u1D4J3 (Σ,/u1D458, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J2Cst|u1D4JDCst ) ≤ 0 , the deformation is purely elastic, and the new st ress and plastic 
strain are determined as 
/u1D6D4|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst=/u1D6D4/tilℂecomb.h1|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst 
|u1D7≠≠ep |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst=|u1D7≠≠ep |u1D4JBCst (233.20) 
The thickness strain increment is given by 
∆|u1D7≠≠|threeCst|threeCst =|u1D7≠≠|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst−|u1D7≠≠|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4JBCst=−|u1D463
1−|u1D463(∆|u1D7≠≠|oneCst|oneCst +∆|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|twoCst ) (233.21) 
If the deformation is not purely elastic, the stres s is not inside the yield surface and a 
plastic iterative procedure must take place as desc ribed in the following: 
1.  Set |u1D4JA = 0,  /u1D6D4(|zeroCst)|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst=/u1D6D4/tilℂecomb.h1|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst, |u1D7≠≠ep (|zeroCst)|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D7≠≠ep |u1D4JBCst and ∆|u1D7≠≠|oneCst|oneCst |u1D4JDCst(|zeroCst)= ∆|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|twoCst |u1D4JDCst(|zeroCst)= 0 *. 33

 Remarks: 
The parameters of the Representative Volume Cell (R VC) are: the yarn span, |u1D46≠, the 
fabric thickness, |u1D461, the yarn width, |u1D464, and the yarn cross-sectional area, |u1D434. The initially 
orthogonal yarns (see Figure M234-2 a) are free to rotate (see Figure M234-2 b) up to 
some angle and after that the lateral contact betwe en the yarns causes the locking of the 
trellis mechanism and the packing of the yarns (see  Figure M234-2 c).The minimum 
braid angle, /u1D̅0:min , can be calculated from the geometry and the archi tecture of the fabric 
material having the yarn width, |u1D464, and the span between the yarns, |u1D46≠: 
sin(2/u1D̅0:|mCst|iCst|nCst ) =|u1D464
|u1D46≠  . 
The range angle, /u1D̅0:loc k , and the maximum braid angle, /u1D̅0:max , are then easily determined 
as: 
/u1D̅0:loc k = 45 °−/u1D̅0:|mCst|iCst|nCst   ,      /u1D̅0:|mCst|aCst|xCst = 45 °+/u1D̅0:loc k    
 
The material behavior of the yarn can be simply des cribed by a combination of one 
Maxwell element without the dashpot and one Kelvin- Voigt element.  The 1-D model of 
viscoelasticity is shown in Figure M234-3 . The diﬀerential equation of viscoelasticity of 
the yarns can be derived from the model equilibrium  as in the following equation: 
(|u1D43∆|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D43∆|u1D44FCst)|u1D7≠∆ + |u1D7≠7|u1D44FCst|u1D7≠∆̇= |u1D43∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D43∆|u1D44FCst|u1D7≠≠ + |u1D7≠7|u1D44FCst|u1D43∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D7≠≠̇

Additional constitutive model requirements include a simple (meaning non-damage 
model based) option that can model the tension crac k requirement: a “stress-cutoﬀ” in 
tension.  This option satisﬁes the tension crack re quirements by limiting the stress in 
tension but not compression and having the tensile “yielding” (that is, the stress-cutoﬀ) 
be fully recoverable – not plasticity or damage bas ed. 
 
The tension stress-cutoﬀ separately resets the stre ss to a limit value when it is exceeded 
in each of the two principal directions.  There is also a strain-based memory criterion 
that ensures unloading follows the same path as loa ding: the “memory criterion” is the 
tension stress assuming that no stress cutoﬀs were in eﬀect.  In this way, when the 
memory criterion exceeds the user-speciﬁed cutoﬀ st ress, the actual stress will be set to 
that value.  When the element unloads and the memor y criterion falls back below the 
stress cutoﬀ, normal behavior resumes.  Using this criterion is a simple way to ensure 
that unloading does not result in any hysteresis.  The cutoﬀ criterion cannot be based on 
an eﬀective stress value because eﬀective stress do es not discriminate between tension 
and compression while also including shear.  This m eans that the in plane, 1- and 2- 
directions must be modeled as independent to use th e stress cutoﬀ.  Because the 
Poisson’s ratio is not zero, this assumption is not  true for cracks that may arbitrarily lie 
along any direction.  However, careful examination of damaged RCC shows that the 
surface cracks do, generally, tend to lie in the fa bric directions, meaning that cracks tend 
to open in the 1- or the 2- direction independently .  So the assumption of directional 
independence for tension cracks may be appropriate for the coating because of this 
observed orthotropy.

 to be the tangent of the polynomial curve.  As a re sult, the stress/strain response has a 
continuous derivative, which aids in avoiding numer ical instabilities.  The test data 
does not clearly deﬁne the failure strain of the co ating, but in the impact test it appears 
that the coating has a higher compressive failure s train in bending than the laminate 
failure strain. 
 
The two dominant modes of loading which cause coati ng loss on the impact side of the 
RCC (the front-side) are in-plane compression and t ransverse shear.  The in-plane 
compression is measured by the peak out of plane te nsile strain,  |u1D7≠≠|threeCst.  As there is no 
direct loading of a shell element in this direction , |u1D7≠≠|threeCst is computed through Poisson’s 
relation:  
|u1D7≠≠|threeCst=−|u1D463
1 − |u1D463(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst+ |u1D7≠≠|twoCst)  . 
When |u1D7≠≠|threeCst is tensile, it implies that the average of |u1D7≠≠|oneCst and |u1D7≠≠|twoCst is compressive.  This failure 
mode will likely dominate when the RCC undergoes la rge bending, putting the front-
side coating in high compressive strains.  A transv erse shear failure mode is expected to 
dominate when the debris source is very hard or ver y fast.  By deﬁnition, the shell 
element cannot give a precise account of the transv erse shear throughout the RCC’s 
thickness.  However, the Belytschko-Tsay shell elem ent formulation in LS-DYNA has a 
ﬁrst-order approximation of transverse shear that i s based on the out-of-plane nodal 
displacements and rotations that should suﬃce to gi ve a qualitative evaluation of the 
transverse shear.  By this formulation, the transve rse shear is constant through the 
entire shell thickness and thus violates surface-tr action conditions.  The constitutive 
model implementation records the peak value of the tensile out-of-plane strain ( |u1D7≠≠|threeCst) and 
peak root-mean-sum transverse-shear: /radical.v2|u1D7≠≠|oneCst|threeCst |twoCst+ |u1D7≠≠|twoCst|threeCst |twoCst.*. 30) and *. 32) for further details.

While the total energy under the traction-separatio n law is given by |u1D43A/u1D4:6.st, one further

function of strain for uniaxial tension in the roll ing direction.  Optionally the 
curve can be substituted for a table deﬁning harden ing as function of plastic 
strain rate (HR = 3) or temperature (HR = 8). 
2.  Exceptions from the rule above are curves deﬁned a s functions of plastic strain 
in the 45 and 90 directions, i.e., P1 and P2 for HR  = 7 and negative R45 or R90. 
The hardening curves are here deﬁned as measured st ress as function of meas- 
ured plastic strain for uniaxial tension in the dir ection of interest, i.e., as deter- 
mined from experimental testing using a standard pr ocedure.  Moreover, the 
curves deﬁning the R values are as function of the measured plastic strain for 
uniaxial tension in the direction of interest.  The se curves are transformed in- 
ternally to be used with the eﬀective stress and st rain properties in the actual 
model.  The eﬀective plastic strain does not coinci de with the plastic strain 
components in other directions than the rolling dir ection and may be some- 
what confusing to the user.  Therefore the von Mise s work equivalent plastic 
strain is output as history variable #2 if HR = 7 o r if any of the R-values is de- 
ﬁned as function of the plastic strain. 
3.  The R-values in curves are deﬁned as the ratio of instantaneous width change 
to instantaneous thickness change.  That is, assume  that the width W and 
thickness T are measured as function of strain.  Th en the corresponding R-
value is given by:

If FLAG = 0, the anisotropic material constants a, b, and c are obtained through 
R00 , R 45 , and R 90  using these 3 equations:

1 + 2|u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst =/u1D450|u1D4JACst *. 43  
 To include strain rate eﬀects in the model we multi ply the yield stress by a 
factor depending on the eﬀective plastic strain rat e.  We use the Cowper-
Symonds’ model, hence the yield stress can be writt en 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D7≠∆/Y.st|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst)

where |u1D7≠∆/Y.st|u1D46≠Cst denotes the static yield stress, |u1D436 and |u1D4JD are material parameters, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst is 
the eﬀective plastic strain rate.

Chaboche and Roussilier.  A back stress α is introduced such that the eﬀective 
stress is computed as 
|u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st= |u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst − 2|u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst , |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst − 2|u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst , |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|twoCst ) 
The back stress is the sum of up to four terms acco rding to 
|u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J8Cst|fourCst
|u1D4J8Cst=|oneCst 
and the evolution of each back stress component is as follows 
|u1D6FF|u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J8Cst= |u1D436|u1D4J8Cst|parenleftCvJ|u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst

The automatic start temperatures are printed to the  messag  ﬁle and if they are not 
accurate enough you can manually set them in the in put deck (must be set in absolute 
temperature, Kelvin).  If HEAT > 0, the temperature  FSnc (ferrite without C) is also 
echoed.  If the specimen exceeds that temperature, all remaining ferrite is instantane- 
ously transformed to austenite.

 Remarks: 
1.  A layer of this material may be placed at a bounda ry of a bounded domain to 
simulate unboundedness of the domain at that bounda ry: the layer absorbs 
and attenuates waves propagating outward from the d omain, without any 
signiﬁcant reﬂection of the waves back into the bou nded domain.  The layer 
cannot support any static displacement.  
2.  It is assumed the material in the bounded domain n ear the layer is, or behaves 
like, a  linear ortho/anisotropic material.  The ma terial properties of the layer 
should be set to the corresponding properties of th is material.  
3.  The layer should form a cuboid box around the boun ded domain, with the 
axes of the box aligned with the coordinate axes.  Various faces of this box may 
be open, as required by the geometry of the problem , e.g., for a half-space 
problem, the “top” of the box should be open. 
4.  Internally, LS-DYNA will partition the entire PML into regions which form the 
“faces”, “edges” and “corners” of the above cuboid box, and generate a new 
material for each region.  This partitioning will b e visible in the d3plot ﬁle.  The 
user may safely ignore this partitioning. 
5.  The layer should have 5 - 10 elements through its depth.  Typically, 5 - 6 
elements are suﬃcient if the excitation source is r easonably distant from the 
layer, and 8 - 10 elements if it is close.  The siz e of the elements should be simi- 
lar to that of elements in the bounded domain near the layer, and should be 
small enough to suﬃciently discretize all signiﬁcan t wavelengths in the prob- 
lem. 
6.  The nodes on the outer boundary of the layer shoul d be fully constrained.  
7.  The stress and strain values reported by this mate rial do not have any physical 
signiﬁcance. *. 46  
 3.  Layer Geometry.   The layer should form a cuboid box around the bou nded 
domain, with the axes of the box aligned with the c oordinate axes.  Various 
faces of this box may be open, as required by the g eometry of the problem.  For 
example, for a half-space problem, the “top” of the  box should be open. 
Internally, LS-DYNA will partition the entire PML i nto regions which form the 
“faces,” “edges” and “corners” of the above cuboid box and generate a new 
material for each region.  This partitioning will b e visible in the d3plot  ﬁle.  The 
user may safely ignore this partitioning. 
4.  Number of Elements in the Layer.   The layer should have 5 - 10 elements 
through its depth.  Typically, 5 - 6 elements are s uﬃcient if the excitation 
source is reasonably distant from the layer, and 8 - 10 elements if it is close.  
The size of the elements should be similar to that of elements in the bounded 
domain near the layer, and should be small enough t o suﬃciently discretize all 
signiﬁcant wavelengths in the problem. 
5.  Nodal Constraints.  The nodes on the outer boundary of the layer should  be 
fully constrained.  
6.  Stress and Strain.   The stress and strain values reported by this mat erial do 
not have any physical signiﬁcance. *. 44. They are pro- 
vided to give reasonable starting results.  These 
values may not reproduce the results from the 
papers by Hippchen.

10.  Phase Indexed Tables.   When using a table ID to describe the Young’s 
modulus as dependent on the temperature, use *DEFIN E_TABLE_2D.  Set the 
abscissa value equal to 1 for the austenite YM-curv e, equal to 2 for the ferrite 
YM-curve, equal to 3 for the pearlite YM curve, equ al to 4 for the bainite YM-
curve and ﬁnally equal to 5 for the martensite YM-c urve.  When using the 
PHASE option only the curves for the included phase s are required, but all ﬁve 
phases may be included.  The total YM is calculated  by a linear mixture law:  
Y M =Y M1 × P H ASE1 +⋯+Y M5 × P H ASE5 
For example: 
*DEFINE_TABLE_2D 
$ The number before curve id:s define which phase t he curve 
$ will be applied to.  1 = Austenite, 2 = Ferrite, 3 = Pearlite,

11.  Phase-indexed Latent Heat Table.   A table ID may be speciﬁed for the Latent 
heat (LAT1) to describe each phase change individua lly.  Use *DEFINE_TA-
BLE_2D and set the abscissa values to the correspon ding phase transition 
number.  That is, 2 for the Austenite – Ferrite, 3 for the Austenite – Pearlite, 4 
for the Austenite – Bainite and 5 for the Austenite  – Martensite.  See Remark 10  
for an example of a correct table deﬁnition.  If a curve is missing, the corre- 
sponding latent heat for that transition will be se t to zero.  Also, when a table is 
used, LAT2 is ignored.  If HEAT > 0, the latent for  the transition back to Aus- 
tenite can also be included.  This latent heat curv e is marked as 1 in the table 
deﬁnition of LAT1. 
12.  Phase-indexed Thermal Expansion Table.   Tables are supported for deﬁning 
diﬀerent thermal expansion properties for each phas e.  The input is identical to 
the above table deﬁnitions.  The table must have th e abscissa values between 1 
and 5 where the number correspond to phase 1 to 5. To exclude one phase 
from inﬂuencing the thermal expansion you simply in put a curve that is zero 
for that phase or even easier, exclude that phase n umber in the table deﬁnition.  
For example, to exclude the bainite phase you only deﬁne the table with curves 
for the indices 1, 2, 3 and 5. 
13.  Phase-indexed Transformation Induced Strain Propert ies.   Transformation 
induced strains can be deﬁne with a table TABRHO, w here densities are de- 
ﬁned as functions of phase (table abscissas) and te mperature (load curves). *. 49

GE.1: Use *INITIAL_STRESS_ SHELL to initialize some 
material properties on an element-by- element basis (see 
Remark 3  below). 
Remarks: 
1.  Stress Calculation.   This material features an additive split of the m atrix and 
reinforcement contributions to the stress.  Therefo re, the combined stress re- 
sponse, /u1D̅48, equals the sum  /u1D̅48|u1D4JACst+/u1D̅48/u1D45:.st. 
The matrix model uses an elastic-plastic material f ormulation with a von-Mises 
yield criterion.  Material parameters, such as Youn g’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio 
and yield stress, can be given as functions of temp erature.  This material sup- 
ports a mixed hardening approach. 
We formulated the contribution of the ﬁber reinforc ement as a hyperelastic 
material.  Based on the orientation angle, |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst, of the ith  ﬁber family, LS-DYNA 
computes an initial ﬁber direction in the element c oordinate system /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst. By 
using the deformation gradient, /u1D405, the current ﬁber conﬁguration is given as 
/u1D426|iCst=/u1D405 /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst, containing all necessary information on ﬁber stra in and reorienta- 
tion.  Here, this vector is always orthogonal to th e shell normal and can, thus, 
be represented by the two in-plane vector component s. 
Following standard textbook mechanics for anisotrop ic and hyperelastic mate- 
rials, the elastic stresses within the ﬁbers due to  tension or compression are 
given as  *. 49

The above table also shows the order of output as w ell as the number of extra 
history variables associated with the particular ﬂa g.  In total NXH extra varia- 
bles are required depending on the choice of parame ter POSTV. For example, 
the maximum number of additional variables is NXH =  32 for POSTV = 127. 
As mentioned in Remark 1  ﬁber orientation is represented in the material su b- 
routine as vector /u1D426|iCst deﬁned in the element coordinate system.  Prior to  writing 
to the list of histories the vector is transformed into the global coordinate sys- 
tem with three vector components for |u1D44∆|fourCst= 1 and/or into the overall material 
coordinate system with two vector components for |u1D44∆|sevenCst= 1.

tensile and compressive stresses.  Any other curves  input with the 
table definition are ignored.  
The damager parameter |u1D4J1|oneCst/u1D45:.st ranges from 0.0 for an undamaged 
ﬁber to 1.0 for a failed ﬁber family.  If all famil ies have failed, 
material failure at the integration point is initia ted.

material based on the current deformation status of  the 1 st  ﬁber

ﬁber strain (for compression and elongation).  If a  table, then the 
values are ﬁber strain rates which index damage as a function of 
ﬁber strain curves. 
The damager parameter |u1D4J1|oneCst|u1D4JACst ranges from 0.0 to 1.5. A value of 0.0 
indicates an undamaged matrix, whereas 1.0 refers t o a 
completely damaged matrix.  To initiate failure of the composite 
at the integration point, a matrix damage |u1D4J1|oneCst|u1D4JACst of 1.5 must be

not change for damage values between 1.0 and 1.5.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
GE.1:  Use *INITIAL_STRESS_ SHELL to initialize some 
material properties on an element-by-ele ment basis (see 
Remark 5  below). 
Remarks: 
1.  Stress Calculation.   This material features an additive split of the m atrix and 
reinforcement contributions to the stress.  Therefo re, the combined stress re- 
sponse, /u1D̅48, equals the sum  /u1D̅48|u1D4JACst+/u1D̅48/u1D45:.st. 
The matrix uses an elastic-plastic material formula tion with a von-Mises yield 
criterion.  This material supports a mixed hardenin g approach. 
We formulated the contribution of the ﬁber reinforc ement as a hyperelastic 
material.  Based on the orientation angle, |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst, of the ith  ﬁber family, LS-DYNA 
computes an initial ﬁber direction in the element c oordinate system /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst. By 
using the deformation gradient, /u1D405, the current ﬁber conﬁguration is given as 
/u1D426|iCst=/u1D405 /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst, containing all necessary information on ﬁber stra in and reorienta- 
tion.  Here, this vector is always orthogonal to th e shell normal and can, thus, 
be represented by the two in-plane vector component s. 
Following standard textbook mechanics for anisotrop ic and hyperelastic mate- 
rials, the elastic stresses within the ﬁbers due to  tension or compression are 
given as  
/u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/u1D45:.st= |summationCv1/u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst)|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst= |summationCv11
/u1D4:D|u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst)(/u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst)|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  , 
where the function |u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst of the ﬁber strain |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst corresponds to the load curve LCEF i. 
|u1D4JB is the number of ﬁber families. 
The shear behavior of the reinforcement can be cont rolled by METH ij.  For val- 
ues less than 10, the behavior is again standard te xtbook mechanics: 
/u1D̅48/u1D446.st/u1D45:.st= |summationCv1/u1D̅48/u1D446.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst/u1D45:.st|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst= |summationCv11
/u1D4:D|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst(/u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst)(/u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst+|oneCst)|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
Here /u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst represents the employed shear measure (scalar prod uct or shear 
angle in radians).  In general, the dyadic product /u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst+|oneCst does not deﬁne a 
shear stress tensor.  This formulation might result  in unphysical shear behavior 
in the case of woven fabrics.  Therefore, we devise d METH ij  = 10 and 11 to 
always give a pure shear stress tensor, /u1D̅48/u1D446.st/u1D45:.st.  *. 49_CRASH  
 Matrix failure ( |u1D4J1|u1D4JACst= 1.0 ) does not necessarily initiate failure of the comp osite 
material.  In this implementation, matrix damage pa rameters |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JACst and |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst|u1D4JACst that 
exceed a value of 1.0 are admissible.  Failure of t he composite is initiated as 
soon as the damage parameter reaches 1.5. To accoun t for this delayed failure, 
the degradation of the matrix stresses is given by:  
/u1D̅48/circum⨂lexcmb.h1|u1D4JACst= |parenleftCv21 − min |parenleftCv11.0, |u1D4J1|u1D4JACst|parenriµhtCv1|parenriµhtCv2/u1D̅48|u1D4JACst  . 
3.  Fiber Viscosity.   Input parameter VISC activates ﬁber viscosity.  Thi s feature 
adds numerical damping to the post-damage behavior of the material.  Damp- 
ing might be necessary since brittle ﬁber failure t ends to induce shockwaves 
through the material, resulting in oscillations or even unphysical damage 
propagation.  
If activated, an additional viscous stress term is added to the ﬁber contribution: 
/u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D463Cst/u1D45:.st= |summationCv11
/u1D4:D⎝⎜⎛/integral.v:|u1D4J3|u1D463Cst(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D71J|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst(/u1D̅0F)

⎠⎟⎞(/u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst)|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
The relaxation function, |u1D4J3|u1D463Cst, is represented by up to four terms of the Prony 
series expansions and thus reads 
|u1D4J3|u1D463Cst(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J8Csts|u1D461Cst
|u1D4J8Cst 
with relaxation moduli |u1D43A|u1D4J8Cst and decay constants |u1D6FD|u1D4J8Cst. 
4.  History Data.   This material formulation outputs to d3plot  additional data for 
post-processing to the set of history variables if requested.  The parameter 
POSTV speciﬁes the data to be written.  Its value i s calculated as 
POST V = |u1D44∆|oneCst+ 2 |u1D44∆|twoCst+ 4 |u1D44∆|threeCst+8 |u1D44∆|fourCst+ 16 |u1D44∆|fiveCst+ 32 |u1D44∆|sixCst+ 64 |u1D44∆|sevenCst. 
Each ﬂag  |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary number (can be either 1 or 0) and corr esponds to one 
particular type of post-processing variable accordi ng to the following table.

 5.  Description of IHIS.   Some material data can be initialized on an element -by-
element basis through history variables deﬁned with  *INITIAL_STRESS_-
SHELL starting at position HISV5.   
How the data is interpreted depends on the paramete r IHIS. Following the 
same concept as for parameter POSTV, the value of I HIS is computed by the 
following expression: 
I H IS = |u1D44∆|oneCst+ 2 |u1D44∆|twoCst 
Each ﬂag  |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary number (can be either 1 or 0) and corr esponds to one 
particular type of material variable.  So far, the only material variables imple- 
mented are ﬁber orientation in two diﬀerent coordin ate systems, global and 
material.  Thus, at most one of the ﬂags |u1D44∆|oneCst and |u1D44∆|twoCst should be set to 1.

Stress Calculation: 
In this model up to three distinct ﬁber families ar e considered.  We assume that there is 
no interaction between the families.  Thus, the res ulting stress tensor is the sum of the 
single ﬁber responses.  Each ﬁber response is the s um of an isotropic and a spatially 
transversely isotropic neo-Hookean stress contribut ion, /u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cst|iCst|sCst /o.st  and /u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cst|tCst /r.st , respectively. The 
implementation is based on the work of Bonet and Bu rton (1998), adapted by BMW for 
simulation of unidirectional fabrics (see reference s below).  
 
The isotropic stress tensor, /u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cstiso , depends on an isotropic shear modulus, |u1D7≠7, and an 
isotropic bulk modulus, |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst where:  
|u1D7≠7 =|u1D438|iCst|sCst /o.st 
2(1 +/u1D̅08) and |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst=|u1D438|iCst|sCst /o.st (/u1D̅08+ |u1D4JB|u1D4J6Cst/u1D̅08|twoCst)
2(1 +/u1D̅08). 
Here, the variable |u1D4JB|u1D4J6Cst denotes the ratio between stiﬀness orthogonally to  the ﬁbers and in 
ﬁber direction, that is, |u1D4JB|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D438|iCst|sCst /o.st /|u1D438|u1D4J6Cst.  |u1D438iso , /u1D̅08, and |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst are input parameters.  Using the left 
Cauchy-Green tensor, /u1D41B, the isotropic neo-Hookean model reads: 
/u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cst|iCst|sCst /o.st =|u1D7≠7
/u1D4:D(/u1D41B−/u1D408) + |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst(/u1D4:D− 1)/u1D408 . 
 
Based on the orientation angel |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst of the ith  ﬁber family, an initial ﬁber direction /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst is 
computed.  The deformation gradient, /u1D405, transforms the initial ﬁber conﬁguration to the 
current ﬁber conﬁguration as /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst=/u1D405 /u1D426 |u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst. This vector contains all necessary information 
on ﬁber elongation and reorientation.

servative calculation in case of missing uniaxial c ompression or combined 
compression and shear experiments:

The yield functions |u1D4J3 and |u1D4J3̂ are formulated in terms of the eﬀective stress ten sor 
/u1D6D4/tilℂecomb.h1=/u1D6D4(1 − |u1D437) ⁄  
and the isotropic material damage |u1D437 according to the continuum damage mechanics in 
Lemaitre [1992].  The stress tensor /u1D6D4 is deﬁned in terms of the elastic strain  /u1D6C6|eCst and the 
isotropic damage |u1D437:  Figure M252-1.   Yield function |u1D4J3 and plastic ﬂow potential |u1D4J3∗

The second factor […] in /u1D̅0F/Y.st describes the rate dependency of the yield strengt h by a 
modiﬁed Johnson & Cook approach with the reference strain rates |u1D6F∆̇|zeroCst and |u1D6F∆̇|mCst which 
limit the shear strength /u1D̅0F/Y.st (see Figure M252-4 ).  
 
The second representation of the yield strength /u1D̅0F/Y.st is the table deﬁnition LCSS, where 
hardening can be deﬁned as a function of plastic st rain, strain rate, and temperature. 
 
Toughened structural adhesives show distortional ha rdening under plastic ﬂow, that is, 
the yield surface changes its shape.  This formativ e hardening can be phenomenological 
described by simple evolution equations of paramete rs |u1D44∆|oneCst= |u1D44∆̂|oneCst(|u1D4JF)  ∧  |u1D44∆|twoCst= |u1D44∆̂|twoCst(|u1D4JF) in the 
yield criterions |u1D4J3 with the initial values |u1D44∆|oneCst|zeroCst  and |u1D44∆|twoCst|zeroCst : 
|u1D44∆|oneCst= |u1D44∆̂|oneCst(|u1D4JF)∧|u1D44∆̇|oneCst= |u1D44∆|oneCst/H.st|u1D4JḞ
|u1D44∆|twoCst= |u1D44∆̂|twoCst(|u1D4JF)∧|u1D44∆|twoCst≥ 0∧|u1D44∆̇|twoCst= |u1D44∆|twoCst/H.st|u1D4JḞ 
The parameters |u1D44∆|oneCst/H.st and |u1D44∆|twoCst/H.st can take positive or negative values as long as th e inequality 
|u1D44∆|twoCst≥ 0 is satisﬁed.  The criterion |u1D44∆|twoCst≥ 0 ensures an elliptic yield surface.  The yield 
criterion |u1D4J3̂ uses only the initial values |u1D44∆|oneCst= |u1D44∆|oneCst|zeroCst  and |u1D44∆|twoCst= |u1D44∆|twoCst|zeroCst  without the distortional 
hardening. 
 
The empirical isotropic damage model |u1D437 is based on the approach in Lemaitre [1985].  
Two diﬀerent evolution equations |u1D437/circum⨂lexcmb.h1̇(|u1D4JF, |u1D4JḞ) and |u1D437/c∙roncmb.h1̇(|u1D6F∆|vCst, |u1D6F∆̇|vCst) are available (see Fig- 
ure M252-5 ). The damage variable |u1D437 is formulated in terms of the damage plastic strai n 
rate |u1D4JḞ (DOPT = 0)

 *. 54  
 Remarks: 
1.  Phase Transformation Matrix.   All data deﬁning the microstructure evolution 
is expected to be given in a tabular form.  The inp ut is structured as a two-
dimensional matrix containing one row for any start ing phase and one row for 
any target phase.  The basic structure is depicted in the following table:  
 Target Phase 
1 2 3 … N Starting Phase 1      
2      
3      
…      
N      
For the input in Card 3, the entry at position ij  of this matrix is interpreted as 
scalar data used for the transformation from phase i to phase j. This could for 
example be the transformation law or the start time .  In LS-DYNA, such a ma- 
trix is deﬁned by the keyword *DEFINE_TABLE(_2D).  The abscissa values are 
the starting phase IDs.  Each load curve (*DEFINE_C URVE) that is referenced 
consequently deﬁnes one row of the matrix.  
Some of the implemented transformation models requi re input data that is a 
function of temperature, temperature rate, equivale nt plastic strain or other 
values.  The input of this data has the same basic input structure as the scalar 
values, but the matrix entries are now load curve I Ds.  Therefore, the input is a 
three-dimensional table (*DEFINE_TABLE_3D) and each  row of the matrix is 
represented by a two-dimensional table itself deﬁne d by *DEFINE_TA-
BLE(_2D). 
2.  Phase Transformation Models.  This material features temperature and phase 
composition dependent elastic plastic behavior.  Th e phase composition is de- 
termined using a list of generic phase transformati on mechanisms you can 
choose from for each of the possible phase transfor mations.  So far, eight 
diﬀerent transformation models have been implemente d to describe the transi- 
tion from source phase concentration, |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst, to target phase concentration, |u1D46J|u1D44FCst.  
Table M254-1  at the end of this remark summarizes the input par ameters nec- 
essary for the individual models. *. 54  
 ﬁned in PTTAB7, the transformation is only active i f the source phase frac- 
tion exceeds the equilibrium, meaning |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst> |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst. 
Note that the JMAK evolution can not only be activa ted by a choice of -2 
(heating) and 2 (cooling), but also by choosing the  law to be 12.  In that 
case, the sign of the temperature rate is not check ed, and the model is al- 
ways active if the temperature is in the temperatur e window deﬁned by 
the start and end temperature of the transformation . 
c)  Kirkaldy, law 3 . 
Similar to the implementation of *. 44, the parameters for the evo lution equation are 
not determined from the chemical composition of the  material but deﬁned 
directly as user input.  The scalar data in PTX1 to  PTX4 are interpreted as 
|u1D4J3 (|u1D436) , |u1D4JB|u1D447Cst, |u1D4JB|oneCst, and |u1D4JB|twoCst. Tabulated data for |u1D437(|u1D447) , /u1D44C(/u1D44B|u1D44FCst), and |u1D46Je q (|u1D447) are given 
in PTTAB1 to PTTAB3. 
d)  Oddy, law 4 . 
For phase transformation in heating, the equation o f Oddy can be used, 
which can be interpreted as a simpliﬁed JMAK relati on and reads as  
|u1D4J1|u1D46J|u1D44FCst
|u1D4J1|u1D461 = |u1D4JB|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst

|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|parenriµhtCvJ
⎠⎟⎞|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst/period.st|zeroCst
|u1D4JBCst
  . 
Its application requires the input of three scalar parameters, |u1D4JB, /u1D450|oneCst, and /u1D450|twoCst, 
that are read from the respective positions in the tables in PTX1 to PTX3. 
e)  Phase recovery I, law 5.  
This phase transformation law is motivated by the r ecovery of the |u1D6FD-phase 
and |u1D6F+-phase from martensitic |u1D6F+-phase in titanium alloys and is a generali- 
zation of the algorithms described in the literatur e for this process. 
The transformation takes place if and only if the a mount of the target 
phase is below a user-deﬁned, temperature dependent  threshold, |u1D46J|u1D44Ftre .  
This threshold can be deﬁned in PTTAB3. *. 54  
 g)  Parabolic growth I, law 7.  
The transformation laws 7 and 8 model the subsequen t dissolution of a 
group of phases into one common target phase.  The remaining fraction of 
the group after dissolution within a time step is d enoted by |u1D46Jdiss .  The 
groups are identiﬁed by a group ID that is here deﬁ ned in PTX1. 
You can deﬁne a dissolution function, |u1D4J3diss , and a critical time, |u1D461crit . These 
values are expected to be functions of temperature and are deﬁned in PT-
TAB3 and PTTAB4, respectively.  Based on those and the temperature de- 
pendent equilibrium concentration |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44FCst (PTTAB2), a characteristic 
dissolution time, |u1D461diss , can be calculated as 
|u1D461diss =
⎝⎜⎛|u1D46J|u1D44FCst(|u1D447)
|u1D46J|u1D44FCste q (|u1D447)⎠⎟⎞|twoCst
|u1D461crit (|u1D447)  . 
Depending on the relative size of the step incremen t, ∆|u1D461, with respect to 
the critical and characteristic dissolution time, t he remaining group frac- 
tion |u1D46Jdiss   is calculated as 
|u1D46Jdiss =/˙raceleft.v61 − |u1D46J|u1D44FCste q (|u1D447)|u1D4J3 (|u1D447)/radical.v1∆|u1D461 + |u1D461diss (|u1D447), for  ∆|u1D461 + |u1D461diss < |u1D461crit 
1 − |u1D46J|u1D44FCste q (|u1D447), otherwise  
Now, the fraction |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst (the transformation of which is deﬁned by law 7) i s 
always assumed to be the ﬁrst member of the group t o by dissolved.  It is 
algorithmically assured that there cannot be an inc rease in fraction |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst. 
h)  Parabolic growth II, law 8.  
This law cannot be deﬁned separately, but simulates  the dissolution of the 
further members of the group already deﬁned for a t ransformation with 
law 7.  Naturally, the group ID must also be refere nced here, and it is 
again given in PTX1.  Furthermore, in the case of t hree or more members 
within a group the order in which the fractions are  to be dissolved must 
be deﬁned.  For that purpose, the position in the g roup is deﬁned in PTX2. 
i)  Extenden Koistinen-Marburger, law 9.   
This extension to the standard Koistinen-Marburger (law 1) is motivated 
by the application of the material formulation to t itanium and is only 
available in cooling. 
An equilibrium concentration |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst of the source phase can be deﬁned as 
function of the current temperature in parameter PT TAB1. The transfor- 
mation is only active if the source phase fraction exceeds the equilibrium, 
meaning |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst> |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst. *. 54  
 The additional variables are to be given by respect ive *DEFINE_FUNCTION 
keywords in the input as functions of the current t ime, the user deﬁned histo- 
ries themselves, the current phase concentrations, the current temperature, the 
peak temperature, the average temperature rate betw een T2PHASE and 
T1PHASE, the current yield stress, the stress tenso r, and the current values for 
the equivalent plastic strain of the individual pha ses.  
For example, if all 24 phases are used (N = 24) and  eight additional history 
variables (NUSHIS = 8) are deﬁned, a function decla ration could look as fol- 
lows: 
*DEFINE_FUNCTION 
1,user defined history 1 
uhist(time,usrhst1,usrhst2,…,usrhst8,phase1, 
phase2,…,phase24,T,Tpeak,Trate,sigy, 
sigma1,sigma2,…,sigma6, 
epspl1,epspl2,…,epspl24)= ...  
In contrast, for four considered phases (N = 4) and  two additional histories 
(NUSHIS = 2) the keyword input could be  
*DEFINE_FUNCTION 
2,user defined history 1 
uhist(time,usrhst1,usrhst2,phase1,phase2,phase3,pha se4, 
T,Tpeak,Trate,sigy,sigma1,sigma2,…,sigma6,epspl1,ep spl2, 
epspl3,epspl4)= ...  
4.  History Values.  To be able to post-process values of history varia bles, ﬁelds 
NEIPS (shells) or NEIPH (solids) must be deﬁned on *DATABASE_EXTENT_-
BINARY. 
Aside from the user-deﬁned history variables discus sed in Remark 3 , this ma- 
terial formulation can output additional pre-deﬁned  history values for post-
processing. The input value of ﬁeld POSTV deﬁnes th e data to be written.  Its 
value is calculated as 
POST V = a|oneCst+ 2 |u1D44∆|twoCst+ 4 |u1D44∆|threeCst+8 |u1D44∆|fourCst 
Each ﬂag  |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary number (can be either 1 or 0) and corr esponds to one 
particular post-processing variable according to th e following table. This table 
also shows the order of output as well as the numbe r of extra history variables 
associated with the particular ﬂag. The values of t hese user-deﬁned histories 
are reset when the temperature is in the annealing range.

5.  Simple Annealing.  When the temperature reaches the start annealing 
temperature TASTART, the material starts assuming i ts virgin properties.  
Beyond the start annealing temperature, it behaves as an ideal elastic-plastic 
material but with no evolution of plastic strains.  
For non-zero values of both TASTART and TAEND a sim ple annealing strate- 
gy is used.  The resetting of eﬀective plastic prop erties in the annealing tem- 
perature interval is done by modifying the eﬀective  plastic strain for each 
phase as 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JBCst= |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/co⋯⋯a.ststart |u1D4JBCst |u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend − |u1D447
|u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend − |u1D447|u1D44∆Cststart   , 
where |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/co⋯⋯a.ststart |u1D4JBCst is the plastic strain for phase |u1D4JB at the beginning of the annealing 
process. 
6.  Enhanced Annealing.  For a positive value of TASTART and TAEND = 0, an 
enhanced annealing strategy is employed.  It requir es the input of an addition- 
al keyword card. 
Above the annealing start temperature |u1D447|u1D44∆Cststart , deﬁned by XASTR, the material 
behaves as an ideal-plastic material, but instead o f an evolution of the plastic 
strains, the equivalent plastic strain |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCstis reduced by a scale factor |u1D6F+(|u1D447, |u1D461)  within 
the annealing temperature window 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JBCst= |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/co⋯⋯a.ststart |u1D4JBCst|parenleftCv1|u1D6F+(|u1D447, |u1D461)|parenriµhtCv1  . 
The base value |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/co⋯⋯a.ststart |u1D4JBCst refers to the equivalent plastic strain found in t he phase, 
|u1D4JB, when the temperature reaches the annealing start temperature for the ﬁrst 
time.  The algorithm used to determine the value of  |u1D6F+ depends on the anneal- 
ing option TASTART. 
a)  Linear annealing.   For TASTART = 1 a linear relation between tempera ture 
and the annealing eﬀect is assumed, similar to the simple annealing option 
discussed above.  But in this case an incomplete re set of the equivalent 
plastic strain data is possible.  The scale factor,  |u1D6F+, is a function of tempera- 
ture and is given by *. 55

ALPHA Coeﬃcient of thermal expansion 
TREF Reference temperature, which is required if an d only if LAL PHA 
is given with a negative load curve ID 
Remarks: 
1.  Strain Rate Effects.   The strain rate eﬀect is modelled by using the Co wper 
and Symonds model which scales the yield stress acc ording to the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇|eCst /f.st/f.st
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst |u1D443Cst ⁄
 
where |u1D7≠≠̇|eCst /f.st/f.st=/radical.v2tr|parenleftCv1/u1D6C6̇/u1D6C6̇/ε.st|parenriµhtCv1 is the Euclidean norm of the total strain rate ten sor if 
VP = 0 (default), otherwise |u1D7≠≠̇|eCst /f.st/f.st= |u1D7≠≠̇|eCst /f.st/f.st|u1D4JDCst. 
2.  Yield Stress Tables.  The dependence of the yield stresses on the eﬀecti ve 
plastic strains is given in two tables. 
a)  TABIDC gives the behaviour of the yield stresses i n compression 
b)  TABIDT gives the behaviour of the yield stresses i n tension. 
The table indices consist of temperatures, and at e ach temperature a yield 
stress curve must be deﬁned. 
Both TABIDC and TABIDT can be 3D tables, in which t emperatures indexes 
the main table and strain rates are deﬁned as value s for the sub tables with 
hardening curves as targets for those strain rates.  If the same yield stress 
should be used in both tension and compression, onl y one table needs to be 
deﬁned and the same TABID is put in position 1 and 2 on Card 2. If VP = 0, 
eﬀective total strain rates are used in the 3D tabl es, otherwise plastic strain 
rates. 
3.  History Variables.   Two history variables are added to the d3plot  ﬁle, the 
Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio, respective ly.  They can be requested 
through the *DATABASE_EXTENT_BINARY keyword. 
4.  Nodal Temperatures.   Nodal temperatures must be deﬁned by using a 
coupled analysis or some other way to deﬁne the tem peratures, such as 
*LOAD_THERMAL_VARIABLE or *LOAD_THERMAL_LOAD_CURVE.*. 56

Remarks: 
1.  Kinematic Hardening.   Kinematic hardening gives rise to the second 
hardening occurrence in the hardening-softening-har dening sequence.  The 
constants |u1D7≠7|u1D44JCst and |u1D7≠6|u1D43FCst enter the back stress, |u1D7≠7|u1D43J  (where |u1D43J is the left Cauchy-Green 
deformation tensor), through the function |u1D7≠7 according to:

formation tensor and /u1D4:F is the Langevin function deﬁned by: 
/u1D4:F(/u1D44B) = coth(/u1D44B) −/u1D44B−|oneCst  . 
2.  Creep.   This material model assumes plastic incompressibi lity.  Nevertheless 
in order to account for the diﬀerent behaviours in tension and compression a 
Drucker-Prager law is included in the creep law acc ording to: 
/u1D̅08|u1D4JDCst=/u1D̅08|zeroCst|parenleftCvJ/u1D̅0F̅
|u1D46≠+|u1D6F+ /u1D̅0B |parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JACst/fraction.v1
  , (256.2) 
where /u1D̅08|u1D4JDCst is the equivalent plastic shear strain rate, /u1D̅0F̅ is the equivalent shear 
stress, |u1D46≠ is the internal variable deﬁned below and −/u1D̅0B is the hydrostatic stress. 
3.  Isotropic Hardening.   Isotropic hardening gives rise to the ﬁrst harden ing 
occurrence in the hardening-softening-hardening seq uence.  Two coupled in- 
ternal variables are deﬁned:  the resistance to pla stic ﬂow, |u1D46≠, and the local free 
volume, |u1D7≠2. Their evolution equations are:

The yield function is deﬁned on the form 
|u1D4J3 =/u1Dℜ11(/u1D̅48) − (|u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D44J) 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st≡/u1Dℜ11(/u1D̅48) is the equivalent stress, |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst is the initial yield stress, and |u1D44J is the 
isotropic hardening variable, which is a function o f the equivalent plastic strain |u1D4JD. The 
equivalent stress is deﬁned as 
/u1Dℜ11(/u1D̅48) =|<racketleftCvJ1

where |u1D7≠∆|oneCst≥ |u1D7≠∆|twoCst≥ |u1D7≠∆|threeCst are the ordered principal stresses.  The isotropic  hardening variable 
is expressed as 
|u1D44J(|u1D4JD) = |summationCv1 |u1D44J|u1D4J6Cst|threeCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst(|u1D4JD) = |summationCv1 |u1D444|u1D4J6Cst

⎠⎟⎞|threeCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst 
where |u1D444|u1D4J6Cst and /u1D̅0:|u1D4J6Cst are in turn the saturation value and initial harde ning modulus of the 
hardening variable |u1D44J|u1D4J6Cst.  As |u1D4JD→∞ , |u1D44J attains its saturation value |u1D44J|u1D46≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D461Cst , given by 
|u1D44J|u1D46≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D461Cst = |summationCv1 |u1D444|u1D4J6Cst|threeCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
 
Rate-dependent plasticity is described by a fully v iscoplastic formulation.  If rate 
dependence is invoked, the equivalent stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st is constrained by the viscoplastic 
relation 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st= |parenleftCv1|u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D44J(|u1D4JD)|parenriµhtCv1 |parenleftCvJ1 +|u1D4JḊ
|u1D4JḊ|u1D7≠∆Cst|parenriµhtCvJ/u1D4:6.st/u1Dℜ0E.sts
 for |u1D4J3 > 0 
in the plastic domain.  The parameters |u1D436|u1D7≠∆Cst and |u1D4JḊ|u1D7≠∆Cst govern the rate dependence of the 
material, where |u1D4JḊ|u1D7≠∆Cst is a reference strain rate.

here to deﬁne damage evolution

history variable #5 and s train rate scale factors are stored in 
history variable #6.  To turn on the variables for viewing in LS-
PrePost , set NEIPS to at least “6” in *DATA-
BASE_EXTENT_ BINARY.  It is very useful to know what levels of 
strain rates, and strain rate scale factors in a pa rticular simulation.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
AOPT Material axes option (see . 60A  *. 60A  
 The required stress-strain hardening curve must be for uniaxial tension along the 
rolling direction.  Strain rate sensitivity is impl emented as an option, by deﬁning a 
curve (LCIDV) of strain rates vs.  stress scale fac tors, see Figure M260A-2 . 
 
The variable SCALE is very useful in speeding up th e simulation while equalizing the 
strain rate eﬀect.  For example, if the real, physi cal pulling speed is at 15 mm/s but 
running at this speed will take a long time, one co uld increase the pulling speed to 500 
mm/s while setting the SCALE to 0.03, resulting in the same results as those from 15 
mm/s with the beneﬁt of greatly reduced computation al time.  See examples in 
V erification . 
History Variables: 
1.  Damage accumulation: history variable #1 (when the  option Xue is used and 
EOS is not used).    The value ranges from 0.0 to 1 .0. 
2.  Damage accumulation: history variable #5 (when the  option Xue and EOS are 
used).  
3.  Strain rates: history variable #5 (when the option  XUE is not used). 
4.  Strain rate scale factors: history variable #6, (w hen the option XUE is not used). 
Veriﬁcation: 
Uniaxial tension tests were done on a single shell element as shown in Figure M260A-1 .  
Strain rate eﬀect LCIDV is input as shown in Figure M260A-2 .  In Figure M260A-3 , 
pulling stress vs.  strain from various test condit ions are compared with input stress-
strain curve A.  In summary, using the parameter SC ALE, the element can be pulled 
much faster (500 mm/s vs.  15 mm/s) but achieve the  same stress vs.  strain results, the 
same strain rates (history variable #5), and the sa me strain rate scale factor (history 
variable #6 in Figure M260A-4 ).  Simulation speed can be improved further with 
increased mass scaling (−1.0 × |u1D4J1|u1D4612|u1D4JA|u1D46≠)  without aﬀecting the results, see Figure M260A-5 . 
 
A partial keyword input is provided below, for the case with pulling speed of 500 
mm/s, strain hardening curve ID of 100, LCIDV curve  ID of 105, and strain rate scale

 Remarks: 
1.  Non-associated Flow Rule.  Referring to [ 1] and [ 2], Hill’s 1948 quadratic 
yield function is written as: 
|u1D4J3 (/u1D6D4,/u1D458) = |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt−/u1D458= 0  , 
where /u1D6D4 is the Cauchy stress tensor and |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt is the equivalent stress, deﬁned by: 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt=/radical.v1(/u1D40F /u1D6D4 )∙/u1D6D4  . 
/u1D40F is a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix deﬁned thro ugh three independent 
parameters, |u1D443|oneCst|twoCst , |u1D443|twoCst|twoCst , and |u1D443|threeCst|threeCst : 
/u1D40F=
⎣⎢⎡1 P|oneCst|twoCst 0
P|oneCst|twoCst P|twoCst|twoCst 0
0 0 P|threeCst|threeCst ⎦⎥⎤  . 
The ﬂow rule, which deﬁnes the incremental plastic strain tensor, is written as 
follows: 
|u1D4J1/u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst= |u1D4J1|u1D6FF |u1D71J|u1D4J4(/u1D6D4)
|u1D71J/u1D6D4  , 
where |u1D4J1|u1D6FF  is a scalar plastic multiplier.  The plastic poten tial function |u1D4J4(/u1D6D4) can 
be deﬁned as a quadratic function in stress space: 
|u1D4J4(/u1D6D4) =/radical.v1(/u1D406 /u1D6D4 )∙/u1D6D4 
with, 
/u1D406=
⎣⎢⎡1 |u1D43A|oneCst|twoCst 0
G|oneCst|twoCst G|twoCst|twoCst 0
0 0 G|threeCst|threeCst ⎦⎥⎤  . 
When /u1D40F/u1D406, the ﬂow rule is non-associated.  The associated ﬂo w rule is recov- 
ered if  /u1D40F=/u1D406. For example, /u1D40F can represent an isotropic von-Mises yield sur- 
face by setting |u1D443|oneCst|oneCst = |u1D443|twoCst|twoCst = 1.0 , |u1D443|oneCst|twoCst = −0.5 , and |u1D443|threeCst|threeCst = 3.0 .  /u1D406 can represent an 
orthotropic plastic ﬂow potential by setting: 
|u1D43A|oneCst|twoCst  = −|u1D4JF|zeroCst
1 + |u1D4JF|zeroCst  ,
|u1D43A|twoCst|twoCst  =|u1D4JF|zeroCst(1 + |u1D4JF/nine.st |zeroCst )

|u1D4JF/nine.st |zeroCst (1 + |u1D4JF|zeroCst)  . 
Here |u1D4JF|zeroCst, |u1D4JF|fourCst|fiveCst , and |u1D4JF/nine.st |zeroCst  are the Lankford coeﬃcients in the rolling, diagon al and 
transverse directions, respectively.  Experiments h ave shown on the stress lev- 
el, some AHSS (Advanced High Strength Steel), e.g.,  DP590, and TRIP780 show 
strong directional dependency for the |u1D4JF-values, while nearly the same stress-
strain curves have been measured in all directions.   The directional dependen-

As shown in a single shell element undergoing uniax ial stretching (see Fig- 
ure M260B-1 ), the general eﬀect of LCIDV is to elevate the str ain hardening 
behavior as the strain rate increases (curve “D” in  Figure M260B-2  top), while 
the eﬀect of LCIDT is strain softening as the tempe rature rises (curve “C” in 
Figure M260B-2  top).  Initially, due to the combined eﬀect of bot h LCIDV and 
LCIDT strain hardening may occur before the tempera ture rises enough to 
cause strain softening in the model (curve “E” in Figure M260B-2  top).  The 
temperature and strain rates calculated for each el ement can be viewed with 
history variables #4 and #5 (curves “C” and “D” in Figure M260B-2  bottom), 
respectively, while the strain rate scale factors a nd temperature scale factors 
can be viewed with history variable #6 and #7, resp ectively. 
3.  Rate-dependent Hosford-Coulomb Fracture Initiation Model.   An 
extension of the Hosford-Coulomb fracture initiatio n model is used to account 
for the eﬀect of strain rate on ductile fracture.  The damage accumulation is 
calculated through history variable #3.  When this history variable reaches 1.0, 
fracture occurs at an equivalent plastic strain, |u1D7≠≠̅/u1D45:.st, that is,

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
described as follows.  If the ﬁrst  value in the table is negative, LS-
DY NA assumes that all the table values represent the natural 
logarithm of a strain rate.  Since the tables are i nternally 
discretized to equally space the table values, it m akes good sense 
from an accuracy standpoint that the table values represent the 
natural log of strain rate when the lowest strain r ate and highest 
strain rate diﬀer by several orders of magnitude.  There is some 
additional computational cost associated with invok ing 
logarithmic interpolation. 
BETA Hardening parameter for in- plane shear plasticity 
(0.0 ≤ BETA ≤ 1.0). 
EQ.0.0: Pure kinematic hardening 
EQ.1.0: Pure isotropic hardening 
0.0 < BETA < 1.0: Mixed hardening 
PFL Percentage of shell or tshell layers which must fai l until 
crashfront is initiated.  For example, if |PFL|  = 80.0, then 80% of 
layers must fail until strengths are reduced in nei ghboring 
elements.  Default: all layers must fail.  A single  layer fails if 1 in-
plane integration point fails (PFL > 0) or if 4 in- plane integration 
points fail (PFL < 0). 
PUCK Flag for evaluation and post-processing of Puc k’s inter-ﬁber-
failure criterion (IFF); see Puck, Kopp and Knops [ 2002].

2.  Damage Evolution.   As long as the stress state is located within the  failure 
surface, the model behaves in an orthotropic elasti c manner.  When reaching 
the failure criteria, the eﬀective (undamaged) stre sses will be reduced by a 
factor of (1 − |u1D4J1) , where the damage variable |u1D4J1 represents one of the damage 
variables deﬁned for the diﬀerent failure mechanism s ( |u1D4J1da , |u1D4J1k in k , |u1D4J1mat ). The 
growth of these damage variables is driven by a lin ear damage evolution law 
based on fracture toughnesses ( /u1D6E4 → ENKINK, ENA, ENB, ENT, ENL) and a 
characteristic internal element length, /u1D4:F, to account for objectivity.  See Figure

So long as the stress state is located within the f ailure surface the model behaves 
orthotropic elastic.  The constitutive law is deriv ed on basis of a proper deﬁnition for 
the ply complementary free energy density |u1D43A, whose second derivative with respect to 
the stress tensor leads to the compliance tensor /u1D40ℜ *. 62  
 become “crashfront” elements and can have their str engths reduced by using the SOFT 
parameter.  An earlier initiation of crashfront ele ments is possible by using the 
parameter PFL.  
The number of additional integration point variable s written to the LS-DYNA database 
is input by the *DATABASE_EXTENT_BINARY deﬁnition w ith the variable NEIPS 
(shells) and NEIPH (solids).  These additional vari ables are tabulated below ( |u1D4J6 = 
integration point). 
When intending to initialize the stress state using  *INTIAL_STRESS_ OPTION , the stress 
values SIGXX, SIGYY, etc.  in *INITIAL_STRESS_ OPTION  are not used, rather stresses 
are determined from the total strain history variab les 31 to 36.

Constitutive relations: 
Drucker proposed a yield function that includes the  eﬀect of the third stress invariant in 
the classic Von Mises yield function.  Lou and Yoon  (2017) extended this yield function 
to an anisotropic form as shown below: 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenriµhtCv2 = (/u1D4:D′|twoCst|threeCst−/u1D450/u1D4:D′|threeCst|twoCst)|oneCst |sixCst ⁄  . 
Here /u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst and /u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst are the second and third invariants of the linear transformed deviatoric 
stress tensor /u1D42C′: 
/u1D42C|minuteCst=/u1D40B|minuteCst/u1D6D4 . 
The fourth order linear transformation tensor /u1D40B′ is given by: 
/u1D40B|minuteCst=  
⎣⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎡(/u1D450|twoCst|minuteCst+/u1D450|threeCst|minuteCst) 3 ⁄ −/u1D450|threeCst|minuteCst3 ⁄ −/u1D450|twoCst|minuteCst3 ⁄ 0 0 0

  . 
/u1D450|oneCst|minuteCst, /u1D450|twoCst|minuteCst, /u1D450|threeCst|minuteCst and /u1D450|sixCst|minuteCst can be calibrated from uniaxial tensile yield stre ss along diﬀerent 
directions and the balanced biaxial yield stress.  /u1D450|fourCst|minuteCst and /u1D450|fiveCst|minuteCst, which are related to the 
through-thickness material properties, are very diﬃ cult to obtain experimentally and 
therefore assumed to be identical with /u1D450|sixCst|minuteCst. 
 
With the non-associated ﬂow rule (non-AFR), the pla stic ﬂow is not necessarily aligned 
with the yield surface normal and the |u1D44J-values are modeled by a diﬀerent plastic 
potential:

MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number must b e speciﬁed. 
RO Mass density. 
F Fiber dispersion parameter governs the extent to wh ich the ﬁber 
dispersion extends to the third dimension. F = 0  and F = 1  apply 
to 2D splay with the normal to the membrane being i n the  |u1D6FD and 
the |u1D6F∆-directions, respectively (see Figure M266-1 ). F = 0.5  applies 
to 3D splay with transverse isotropy.  Splay will b e orthotropic 
whenever F≠0.5. This parameter is ignored if INIT = 1. 
SIGMA The parameter SIG MA governs the extent of dispersion, such that 
as SIG MA goes to zero, the material symmetry reduces to p ure 
transverse isotropy.  Conversely, as SIG MA becomes large, the 
material symmetry becomes isotropic in the plane.  This 
parameter is ignored if INIT = 1. *. 66

|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D438|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠6 − 1) + |u1D438/u1D45:.st(|u1D7≠6 −Λ).

Basic Theory.   This model is based on the work done by Arruda an d Boyce [1993], 
in particular Arruda’s thesis [1992].  The eight ch ain rubber model is based on 
hyper-elasticity, and it is formulated by using ela stic strain invariants.  Strain 
softening is accounted for by the parameter from |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst following the work done by Qi 
and Boyce [2004]. 
 
The strain energy is deﬁned in terms of the elastic  deformation gradient /u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst through 
the right Cauchy-Green tensor /u1D46A|u1D4J2Cst=/u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst|u1D447Cst/u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst and its determinant /u1D4:D|u1D4J2Cst= det /u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst as /u1D6F∫=/u1D6F∫|oneCst+

/u1D6F∫|oneCst= |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst|u1D7≠7|<racketleftCvJ/radical.v1/u1D441/u1D6EC|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D6FD +/u1D441ln |parenleftCvJ|u1D6FD

with ℒ−|oneCst denoting the inverse of the Langevin function ℒ(|u1D46J) = coth|u1D46J − 1/|u1D46J  and the 
ampliﬁed chain stretch is given by

Among the constant parameters we have |u1D7≠7 is the initial modulus of the soft domain, 
/u1D̅05 the bulk modulus, /u1D̅08con  a pressure inﬂuential exponent and  /u1D441 is the number of 
rigid links between crosslinks of the soft domain r egion. /u1D44B is a general polynomial 
describing the interaction between the soft and har d phases (Qi and Boyce [2004] 
and Tobin and Mullins [1957]).  It is given by 
/u1D44B(|u1D463|u1D46≠Cst) = 1 + |u1D434(1 − |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst) + |u1D43J(1 − |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst)|twoCst *. 67

and Hughes (2000).

The number of Prony terms is restricted to a maximu m of 6.  Also /u1D̅0F/u1D6FC.st and

and the hardening is either based on a load curve I D (-YLD0) or an extended Voce 
hardening 
|u1D7≠∆yld = |u1D7≠∆yld0+ |u1D444|oneCst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2|u1D43JCst|oneCsts|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D444|twoCst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2|u1D43JCst|twoCsts|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D444|threeCst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2|u1D43JCst|threeCsts|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D444|fourCst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2|u1D43JCst/four.sts|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|parenriµhtCv2  . 
The evolution of the elastic deformation gradient /u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst is written as 
 
/u1D46Ḋ|u1D4J2Cst= (/u1D4̅:−/u1D4̅:|u1D4JDCst)/u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst 
 
where /u1D4̅: is the spatial velocity gradient and /u1D4̅:|u1D4JDCst is the spatial (Eulerian) plastic 
velocity gradient which is given by the associative  ﬂow rule 
/u1D4̅:|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠̅̇|u1D71J|u1D4J3 
|u1D71J/u1D̅48 
 
with |u1D4J3 being the rate independent yield surface 
|u1D4J3 = |u1D7≠∆eff − |u1D7≠∆yld . 
For rate independent plasticity ( VISPL = 0 ) the evolution of plastic strain |u1D7≠≠̅ follows 
from the consistency conditions |u1D4J3 ≤ 0 , |u1D7≠≠̅̇≥ 0 and |u1D4J3 |u1D7≠≠̅̇= 0. For viscoplasticity these 
conditions are abandoned, but we instead invoke a c onstitutive equation for the 
eﬀective plastic strain rate.  This is the Perzyna (1966) overstress model, and three 
diﬀerent formulations are available. 
a)  VISPL = 1 .  The evolution equation is 
|u1D7≠≠̅̇= |parenleftCvJmax (|u1D4J3 , 0)
|u1D43∆|oneCst|parenriµhtCvJ/u1D446.st|oneCsts

where |u1D43∆|oneCst and |u1D446|oneCst are viscoplastic material parameters.

3/u1D441|u1D463Cst 
is the relative network stretch for the viscoelasti c part.  The evolution of the elastic left 
Cauchy-Green tensor can be written

where the inelastic rate-of-deformation tensor is g iven as

and this stretch is available as the plastic strain  variable in the post processing of this 
material.  The volumetric part is elastic and gover ned by the bulk modulus, the

is given as

and plastic strains evolve when the eﬀective stress  exceeds this value.  The 
back stress evolves as

where |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst is the rate of eﬀective plastic strain that follow s from consistency 
equations. 
3.  Annealing.   When the temperature reaches the start annealing temperature, 
the material starts assuming its virgin properties.   Beyond the start annealing 
temperature it behaves as an ideal elastic-plastic material but with no evolution 
of plastic strains.  The resetting of eﬀective plas tic properties in the annealing 
temperature interval is done by modifying the eﬀect ive plastic strain and back 
stress before the stress update as 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JBCstmax |<racketleftCv60, min |parenleftCv61,|u1D447 − |u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend

|u1D447|u1D44∆Cststart − |u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend |parenriµhtCv6|<racketriµhtCv6 
 
Depending on the choice for parameter ANOPT, anneal ing may also aﬀect the 
thermal expansion of the structure.  A cut-oﬀ tempe rature can be deﬁned for 
the evaluation of the thermal expansion.  Above thi s temperature limit, further 
expansion is suppressed.  The cut-oﬀ temperature do es not necessarily coin- 
cide with the annealing temperature.

The variable ℎ is a mesh-dependent measure used to convert strain s to displacements.  
The variable  |u1D7≠≠|u1D461 is called the inelastic tensile strain and is deﬁn ed as the sum of the 
irreversible plastic strain |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JD and the reversible strain |u1D464|u1D461|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ − |u1D7≠≠ |u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv2 (in compression 
|u1D464/u1D450|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ − |u1D7≠≠ |u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv2). To get the inﬂuence of multi-axial stress states  on the softening a damage 
ductility measure |u1D46J|u1D46≠ is added: 
|u1D46J|u1D46≠= 1 + |parenleftCv1|u1D434|u1D46≠− 1|parenriµhtCv1|u1D44J|u1D46≠|u1D43J|u1D46≠ 
Where |u1D434|u1D46≠ and |u1D43J|u1D46≠ are input parameters, and

The inelastic strain is then modiﬁed according: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6=|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6
|u1D46J|u1D46≠ 
Compressive damage is controlled by an exponential stress-inelastic strain law.  Stress 
value /u1D48ℜ/u1D484 and inelastic strain /u1D̅:A/u1D48ℜ/u1D484 need to be speciﬁed, see ﬁgure below how the stres s 
softening is controlled by the input parameters.  A  small value of /u1D̅:A/u1D48ℜ/u1D484, i.e. 1.0E-4 
(default),  provides for a rather brittle form of d amage.

3.  Material Model for Shell Elements.  The stress-strain relationship for shell 
elements is based on an additive split of the rate of deformation into an elastic 
and a plastic part 
/u1D40:=/u1D40:|u1D4J2Cst+/u1D40:|u1D4JDCst  , 
and the rate of Cauchy stress is given by 
/u1D6D4̇=/u1D402/u1D40:|u1D4J2Cst  . 
In out-of-plane compression the stress rate is modi ﬁed according to 
|u1D7≠∆̇|threeCst|threeCst = |u1D436|threeCst|oneCst |u1D437|oneCst|oneCst |u1D4J2Cst+ |u1D436|threeCst|twoCst |u1D437|twoCst|twoCst |u1D4J2Cst+ |u1D437|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4J2Cst|<raceleftCvJ|u1D438|threeCst, |u1D7≠≠|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4J2Cst≥ 0

For shell elements, |u1D437|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4JDCst= 0, and only two yield surfaces are present: the in-

A Maxwell material is obtained by providing an elem ent with a nonzero |u1D44∆|zeroCst (A0) and 
with other parameters set to zero.  This parameter should be interpreted as the 
viscoelastic relaxation coeﬃcient determining the r ate at which the stress relaxes to zero 
(see parameter BETA in *. 75  *. 75  
 polynomial equation.  This is exempliﬁed in Figure M275-3  using one HJR element with 
|u1D43∆ = 1 , |u1D43A = 1.5 , /u1D̅05|zeroCst=/u1D̅05|u1D46≠Cst= 0.01  and |u1D4JA = 0 . The engineering strain is ramped up to 5 %  
and down to 0 and |u1D44F|oneCst is varied with all other parameters zero; the resp onse tends to an 
elastic-perfectly plastic as |u1D44F|oneCst increases.  The saturated stress value for |u1D44F|oneCst→∞  can be 
calculated as

Isotropic strain hardening ( /u1D̅05|u1D46≠Cst>/u1D̅05|zeroCst) or softening ( /u1D̅05|u1D46≠Cst</u1D̅05|zeroCst) is obtained with |u1D4JA > 0 ; /u1D̅05 
tends exponentially towards /u1D̅05|u1D46≠Cst at a rate determined by |u1D4JA. Using |u1D44F|oneCst= 1000  (meaning 
very little overstress), /u1D̅05|zeroCst= 0.02 , and /u1D̅05|u1D46≠Cst= 0.01  while varying |u1D4JA, the softening response 
in Figure M275-4  is obtained.  The rate at which the element harden s is diﬃcult to 
quantitatively estimate, but presumably it depends not only on |u1D4JA but also on |u1D44F|oneCst. It is 
important to note however that for small to moderat e |u1D44F|oneCst the model appears to harden 
with |u1D4JA = 0 , which is due to larger overstress.  The hardening  determined by |u1D4JA can be 
determined from a loading, unloading and reloading cycle to detect how the the yield 
strain /u1D̅05 changes; see Hollenstein et.al.  [2013]. 
 
Finally, |u1D44∆|oneCst (A1) is the viscoplastic parameter determining how  stress responds to change 
in strain rate.  Its interpretation is very similar  to that of |u1D44∆|zeroCst; stress increases with 
increasing loading rate and relaxes to the saturate d stress value given by ( M275.1 ) and 
(M275.2 ). In Figure M275-5  a rate dependency is illustrated for |u1D43∆ = 1 , |u1D43A = 1.5 , /u1D̅05|zeroCst=/u1D̅05|u1D46≠Cst=-0.075-0.050-0.0250.0000.0250.0500.0750.1000.125

The Cauchy stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , is related to the strain rate by  
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst (|u1D461) = −|u1D4JD|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst +/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (/u1D̅0F)

For this model, it is postulated that the mathemati cal form is preserved in the 
constitutive equation for aging; however two new ma terial functions, |u1D4J4|zeroCst|minuteCst(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) and |u1D4J4|oneCst|minuteCst(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst, |u1D461) 
are introduced to replace |u1D4J4|zeroCst and |u1D4J4|oneCst(|u1D461), which is expressed in terms of a Prony series as

LCCHEXP |LCC H EXP | is a load curve ID deﬁning the coeﬃcient for chemical 
shrinkage |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+)  as a function of the state of cure, |u1D6F+. If set, 
parameters CHEXP1, CHEXP2 and CHEXP3 are ignored.  See 
Remark 1  below. 
LCTHEXP |LCT H EXP | is a l oad curve ID or table ID deﬁning the coeﬃcient 
of thermal expansion  |u1D6FD(|u1D6F+, |u1D447)  as a function of cure, |u1D6F+, and 
temperature, |u1D447. If referring to a load curve, parameter |u1D6FD(|u1D447)  is a 
function of temperature,  |u1D447. 
R Gas constant, |u1D44J, for Kamal model 
TREFEXP Reference temperature, |u1D4470, for secant form of thermal expansion.  
See Remark 1  below. 
DOCREXP Reference degree of cure, |u1D6F+0, for sequential form of chemical 
expansion.  See Remark 1  below. 
WLFTREF Reference temperature for either the Arrhen ius or Williams-
Landel- Ferry shift function (must be greater than zero for  the shift 
function).  Set to zero (along with WL FA and WLFB) to not apply 
scaling.  See Remark 2 . *. 77  
 |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+) = |u1D6F∆|twoCst|u1D6F+|twoCst+ |u1D6F∆|oneCst|u1D6F+ + |u1D6F∆|zeroCst  . 
For positive values of the parameter LCCHEXP, a diﬀ erential form is used to 
compute the chemical strains: 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ ch = |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+)|u1D4J1|u1D6F+  . 
Otherwise a secant form deﬁnes the strains: 
|u1D7≠≠ch = |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+)(|u1D6F+ − |u1D6F+|zeroCst) − |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+/u1D4:C.st)(|u1D6F+/u1D4:C.st− |u1D6F+|zeroCst)  . 
Consequently, the deﬁnition of |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+)  as quadratic expression goes along the 
secant formulation. 
Analogously, the thermal strains are either deﬁned in a secant or diﬀerential 
form, depending on the load curve parameter LCTHEXP . For positive values 
of that parameter , the diﬀerential form is applied, otherwise the sec ant form is 
used.  For the latter the reference temperature |u1D447|zeroCst is identiﬁed with the input 
parameter TREFEXP. In both cases the coeﬃcient of t hermal expansion can be 
given as table depending on degree of cure and temp erature. 
Finally, the Cauchy stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6 /u1D45̅, is related to the strain rate by  
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst (|u1D461) =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (/u1D̅0F)
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst  . 
The relaxation functions |u1D4J4|u1D4J6 /u1D45̅/u1D458/u1D45∫(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) are represented in this material formulation 
by up to 16 terms (not including the instantaneous modulus |u1D43A0) of the Prony 
series: 
g(|u1D461, |u1D6F+) = |u1D43A|zeroCst(|u1D6F+) − |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D6F+)
|u1D4J6Cst+ |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D6F+)
|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts|u1D461Cst  . 
For the sake of simplicity, a constant ratio |u1D43A|u1D4J6(|u1D6F+)|u1D43A0(|u1D6F+) ⁄ for all degrees of cure is 
assumed.  Consequently, it suﬃces to deﬁne one term  |u1D43A0(|u1D6F+) as a function of the 
degree of cure and further coeﬃcients for the fully  cured state of the adhesive: 
g(|u1D461, |u1D6F+) = |u1D43A|zeroCst(|u1D6F+)

2.  Temperature Effect on the Stress Relaxation.  A possible temperature eﬀect 
on the stress relaxation (see Remark 1 ) is accounted for by the Williams-
Landel-Ferry (WLF) shift function or the Arrhenius shift function.  For details 
on this function, please see material formulation 7 6, *. 78  *. 77.  It was develope d with the collaboration of Professor 
Tabiei from UC.  . 77 provides the viscoelastic behav ior of epoxy resin.  Both the epoxy 
resin and the ﬁber orientation and deformation cont ribute to the overall stress.

Remarks: 
In this elastoplastic cohesive material the normal and tangential directions are treated 
separately, but can be connected by expressing the in-plane traction parameters as 
functions of the normal traction.  In the normal di rection the material uses diﬀerent 
models in tension and compression.

Remarks: 
1.  Plane Stress Failure Criteria.  The underlying material behavior before 
failure is isotropic, small strain linear elasticit y with Young’s modulus, |u1D438, and 
Poisson’s ratio, /u1D̅08. Asymmetric (tension-compression dependent) failur e hap- 
pens as soon as one of the following plane stress f ailure criteria is violated. 
a)  Rankine Maximum Stress.   For FMOD = 0, a maximum stress criterion 
(Rankine) is used where principal stresses, |u1D7≠∆|oneCst and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst, are bound by tensile 
strength, |u1D4J3|u1D461Cst, and compressive strength, |u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst, as follows: 
−|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst<{|u1D7≠∆|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|twoCst}< |u1D4J3|u1D461Cst 
b)  Mohr-Coulomb.   With FMOD = 1, the Mohr-Coulomb criterion with ex - 
pressions in four diﬀerent categories is used: 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst> 0 and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst> 0:  max |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆|oneCst
|u1D4J3|u1D461Cst,|u1D7≠∆|twoCst
|u1D4J3|u1D461Cst|parenriµhtCvJ < 1
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst< 0 and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst< 0:             max |parenleftCvJ−|u1D7≠∆|oneCst
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst, −|u1D7≠∆|twoCst
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|parenriµhtCvJ < 1
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst> 0 and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst< 0:  |u1D7≠∆|oneCst
|u1D4J3|u1D461Cst−|u1D7≠∆|twoCst
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst< 1
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst< 0 and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst> 0: −|u1D7≠∆|oneCst
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst+|u1D7≠∆|twoCst
|u1D4J3|u1D461Cst< 1 
c)  Drucker-Prager.   For FMOD = 2, the plane stress Drucker-Prager cri terion 
is given by: *. 80  
 4.  Number of Failed Integration Points.   If the critical number of failed 
integration points (NIPF) in one element is reached , all integration points over 
the element thickness fail as well.  The default va lue of NIPF=1 resembles the 
fact, that a crack in a glass plate immediately run s through the thickness. 
5.  Damage Model.   Starting with the release of LS-DYNA version R10,  a damage 
model for stress and stiﬀness softening can be acti vated with IMOD = 1. The 
corresponding evolution law for ILAW = 0 is given b y: 
|u1D437 =
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧ 0 for /u1D̅05≤/u1D̅05|zeroCst
1 −/u1D̅05|zeroCst
/u1D̅05|parenleftCv31 − |u1D6F+|u1D461Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J≠Cst+ |u1D6F+|u1D461Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D461.sts/comm∙.sts/u1D4⃡0.sts|parenleftCv2/u1Dℜ0⃡.st−/u1Dℜ0⃡.st|zeroCsts|parenriµhtCv2|parenriµhtCv3otherwise  
meaning tensile and compressive failure are treated  in the same fashion.  
However, with ILAW = 1 the damage evolution for ten sile failure is given by: 
|u1D437 =
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧ 0 for /u1D̅05≤/u1D̅05|zeroCst
1 −/u1D̅05|zeroCst
/u1D̅05|parenleftCv31 − |u1D6F+|u1D461Cst+ |u1D6F+|u1D461Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D461.sts|parenleftCv2/u1Dℜ0⃡.st−/u1Dℜ0⃡.st|zeroCsts|parenriµhtCv2|parenriµhtCv3otherwise  
while damage for compressive failure evolves as (mo re delayed stress reduc- 
tion): 
|u1D437 =
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧ 0 for /u1D̅05≤/u1D̅05|zeroCst
1 −/u1D̅05|zeroCst
/u1D̅05(1 − |u1D6F+|u1D4J≠Cst) − |u1D6F+|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D4⃡0.sts|parenleftCv2/u1Dℜ0⃡.st−/u1Dℜ0⃡.st|zeroCsts|parenriµhtCv2otherwise

 where the functions of |u1D4J4/u1D4:C.st and |u1D4J4/u1D446.st depends on the parameter ST Y PE . For nega- 
tive values of |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst, there will be no contribution to the free energy and |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst≤ 0 thus 
deﬁnes the set of admissible values for |u1D7≠6 and |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JACst. 
The function |u1D43A|u1D7≠6Cst denotes volume fraction energy and is deﬁned as 
|u1D43A|u1D7≠6Cst(|u1D7≠6) =KL × |u1D7≠6/M.st/L.st +|oneCst
ML + 1, KL, ML ≥ 0. 
Thus, the amount of stored energy in the system can  increase with increasing

In this model,  |u1D7≠6 and |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JACst can, however, evolve freely, and the evolution is in-

 2.  Transition Temperatures.   The initial (zero stress) austenite and martensit e 
start and ﬁnish temperatures, TMF ≤ TMS ≤ TAS ≤ TAF , can be given instead 
of the parameters TC , KL, and D0L . The temperatures are deﬁned as  
TMS = TC |parenleftCvJ1 −D0L 
L H |parenriµhtCvJ
TMF = TC |parenleftCvJ1 −D0L + KL 
L H |parenriµhtCvJ
TAS = TC |parenleftCvJ1 +D0L − KL 
L H |parenriµhtCvJ
  TAF = TC |parenleftCvJ1 +D0L 
L H |parenriµhtCvJ 
which gives 
TC =1
2(TMS + TAF)
KL 
L H = 1 −TMF + TAS 
TMS + TAF 
D0L 
L H =TAF − TMS 
TAF + TMS  
Thus, if 0 < TMF ≤ TMS ≤ TAS ≤ TAF  are given as keyword input, then TC , 
KL, and D0L  are calculated as above, and their keyword values are ignored. 
3.  Heat Generation.   The internal energy is 
/u1D̅16=/u1D44A− |u1D7≠2|u1D447  , 
and the entropy is deﬁned as 
|u1D7≠2 = −|u1D71J /u1D44A 
|u1D71J|u1D447 = −|u1D7≠6L H 
TC +/u1D450(|u1D7≠6) |parenleftCvJ1 + ln |parenleftCvJ|u1D447
TC |parenriµhtCvJ|parenriµhtCvJ  . 
From the diﬀerential of /u1D44A, we have 
/u1D44Ȧ=  |u1D7≠∆:|u1D7≠≠̇− |u1D437 − |u1D7≠2|u1D447̇  , 
and thus 
/u1D̅16̇= |u1D7≠∆:|u1D7≠≠̇− |u1D437 − |u1D7≠2|u1D447̇− |parenleftCv1|u1D7≠2̇|u1D447 + |u1D7≠2|u1D447̇|parenriµhtCv1 = |u1D7≠∆:|u1D7≠≠̇− |u1D437 − |u1D7≠2̇|u1D447  . 
Combining this with the energy balance 
/u1D̅16̇= |u1D7≠∆:|u1D7≠≠̇+∇⋅(/u1D458∇|u1D447)  , 
we get 
/u1D450(|u1D7≠6)|u1D447̇=∇⋅(/u1D458∇|u1D447) + |u1D444  , 
with the volumetric heat generation rate 
|u1D444 = |u1D447L H

Remarks: 
1.  Fiber and Resin Properties.   The dry ﬁber properties, EF3 and VF23, and the 
cure resin properties, EM and VM, are used to calcu late the through thickness 
elastic modulus of the prepreg using the rule of mi xture.  These properties will 
not aﬀect the in-plane deformation of the prepreg d uring the preforming 
simulation. 
2.  Shear Locking.   In most of the preforming cases, the angle betwee n the ﬁber 
yarns will not reach the shear locking state.  This  model is not designed for, 
and, therefore, not recommended for simulating shea r locking. 
3.  History Variables.  hsv1 represents the angle between warp/weft yarns,  and 
hsv2,3 are the stretch ratio of ﬁbers in 1,2 direct ions respectively. *. 93  
 The uniaxial tension test is used to obtain the ﬁbe r direction undulation strains 
and the stable tensile moduli, together with the in -plane Poisson’s ratio (PR).  A 
typical test result is shown in Figure M293-2 .  From the stretch ratio-
engineering stress curve, the tensile modulus, ET, and the stretch ratio at the 
end of undulation, EPSILON, can be captured. 
The bias-extension test is used to characterize the  shear behavior of the compo- 
site needed for ﬁelds G12 |u1D4J6. The test procedure comes from the benchmark test 
literature [1].  An example of the bias-extension t est angle change-engineering 
stress curve is shown in Figure M293-3 . Undulation

point, |u1D443, in space and the global location of the element 
center; this is the /u1D41A-direction.  This option is for solid 
elements only. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with ma terial axes determined by 
vectors /u1D41A and /u1D41D input below, as with *DEFINE_COOR-
DINATE_VECTOR 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by a 
vector /u1D42F and the normal vector to the plane of the ele- 
ment.  The plane of a solid element is the mi dsurface 
between the inner surface and outer surface deﬁned by 
the ﬁrst four nodes and the last four nodes of the con- 
nectivity of the element, respectively.  Thus, for solid 
elements, AOPT = 3 is only available for hexahedrons. 
/u1D41A is determined by taking the cross product of /u1D42F with 
the normal vector, /u1D41B is determined by taking the cross 
product of the normal vector with /u1D41A, and /u1D41C is the nor- 
mal vector.  Then /u1D41A and /u1D41B are rotated about /u1D41C by an an- 
gle BETA. BE TA may be set in the keyword input for 
the element or in the input for this keyword.  Note  that 
for solids, the material axes may be switched depen d- 
ing on the choice of MACF. The switch may occur be-
fore or after applying BETA depending on MACF.  
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotropic in a cylindrical coordinate syst em 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D443, which deﬁne the centerline ax- 
is.  This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: |AOPT|  is a coordinate system ID (see *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_ OPTION ).

5.  General Structure Tensor.  Considering the anisotropic part of the strain 
energy function, one may distinguish angular integr ation (AI) and general 
structure tensor (GST) based models.  Owing to thei r numerical eﬃcacy, cur- 
rently all models in LS-DYNA rely on the general st ructure tensor [7] , [8] . Pa- 
rameters deﬁning the structure tensor and ﬁber mode ls need to be provided 
for each ﬁber family.  Consequently, one may use di ﬀerent structure tensors 
and/or ﬁber models to describe the behavior of the individual ﬁber families. 
The model proposed by Freed et al. [3]  is a special case of the general structure 
tensor-based models assuming rotational symmetric ﬁ ber dispersion, deter- 
mining the parameters A and B using a normal distri bution, and invoking the 
ﬁber model introduced by Freed and Doehring [2] . 
6.  Fiber Families.  Characteristic material directions within the plan e are deﬁned 
by ﬁber families.  The number of ﬁber families for INTYPE = 0 is currently 
limited to 3. If INTYPE = 1, the number of ﬁber fam ilies is limited to 2 that 
represent the ﬁber and sheet directions, respective ly.  The ﬁber and sheet direc- 
tions form an orthonormal basis. 
7.  Coupling (Quasi-)Invariants.  To further enhance the material model, coupling 
(quasi-) invariants associated with pairs of direct ions may be included in the 
strain-energy function.  Following the formulation in Holzapfel and Ogden [7]  
and Eriksson et al. [1] , a single coupling invariant deﬁned between the or - 
thonormal ﬁber and sheet directions is included wit h INTYPE = 1. 
8.  Onset of Active Stress. The input for this model gives you several diﬀerent  
methods for triggering the activation and deactivat ion of the active stress de- 
velopment.  
a)  For ACTYPE = 1, 2, 3, and 4, T0 speciﬁes the time at which active stress 
development is activated.  This method does not inc lude deactivation.  
The other methods take priority over setting T0. 
b)  For all ACTYPE options, you can specify ACID and A CTHR. ACID repre- 
sents the evolution of either the calcium ion conce ntration (ACTYPE = 1, 
2, 3, or 5) or the transmembrane potential (ACTYPE = 4) over time.  AC-
THR is a threshold value for one of these quantitie s depending on AC-
TYPE. When the calcium ion concentration or transme mbrane potential 
from the curve exceeds the threshold, the active st ress development is ac- 
tivated.  When it is less than the threshold, the a ctive stress development 
is deactivated.  With this method, the active stres s development can be re- 
activated again when the value in the curve exceeds  the threshold. *. 95

TREF Reference temperature, |u1D447ref  
Remarks: 
In the Anand model, the equivalent stress |u1D7≠∆ is proportional to the deformation 
resistance |u1D46≠ and depends upon the temperature |u1D447 and the equivalent elastic strain |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst as 
|u1D7≠∆ =/u1D450|parenleftCv1|u1D447, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D46≠ , 
where /u1D450 is a material parameter deﬁned by 
/u1D450=1
/u1D̅0∫sinh −|oneCst|<racketleftCv6|parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst
|u1D434exp (|u1D444
|u1D44J|u1D447 )|parenriµhtCv6|u1D4JACst
|<racketriµhtCv6  .  
The material parameter /u1D450 depends on material constants deﬁned in the variab le list 
above and the universal gas constant |u1D44J. 
 
The above equations can be rearranged to express th e equivalent inelastic strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst 
in terms |u1D7≠∆, |u1D447, and |u1D46≠ as 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst= |u1D434 exp |parenleftCvJ−|u1D444
|u1D44J|u1D447 |parenriµhtCvJ |<racketleftCv4sinh(/u1D̅0∫|u1D7≠∆
|u1D46≠)|<racketriµhtCv4|oneCst |u1D4JACst ⁄
  . 
This is called the ﬂow equation.   
 
The rate of deformation resistance |u1D46≠̇ is deﬁned as  
|u1D46≠̇=/u1D4:B|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst  , 
where  
/u1D4:B=/u1D4:B|zeroCst|dividesCvJ1 −|u1D46≠

|u1D46≠|u1D46≠Cst|parenriµhtCvJ . 
In the above equation, |u1D46≠|u1D46≠Cst is the deformation resistance saturation value whi ch is deﬁned 
as 
|u1D46≠|u1D46≠Cst= |u1D46≠̅|<racketleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst

 With the equivalent inelastic strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, the inelastic strain components can be 
computed based on a normality hypothesis of the Pra ndtl-Reuss ﬂow law:  
/u1D6C6̇|u1D4JDCst=/radical.v53
2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst/u1D40D  . 
In the above equation, the direction of plastic ﬂow  /u1D40D is deﬁned as  
/u1D40D=/radical.v53
2/u1D412
|u1D7≠∆  , 
where /u1D412 is the deviatoric part of the stress /u1D6D4. 
 
The Cauchy Stress /u1D41: for this model is 
/u1D41:=/u1D4:D|u1D4J2Cst−|oneCst/u1D411|u1D4J2Cst/u1D40C|u1D4J2Cst/u1D411|u1D4J2Cst/u1D44̅.sts  , 
where 
/u1D40C|u1D4J2Cst=/u1D402[/u1D404|u1D4J2Cst− |u1D6F+(|u1D447 − |u1D447|zeroCst)]  . 
|u1D447|zeroCst is the initial temperature.  /u1D402 is deﬁned as 
/u1D402≝2|u1D43A |parenleftCvJ/u1D⃡40|u1D46≠Cst−1
