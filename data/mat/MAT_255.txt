  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
NE.0.0:  eﬀective plastic strain rate 
ALPHA Coeﬃcient of thermal expansion 
TREF Reference temperature, which is required if an d only if LAL PHA 
is given with a negative load curve ID 
Remarks: 
1.  Strain Rate Effects.   The strain rate eﬀect is modelled by using the Co wper 
and Symonds model which scales the yield stress acc ording to the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇|eCst /f.st/f.st
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst |u1D443Cst ⁄
 
where |u1D7≠≠̇|eCst /f.st/f.st=/radical.v2tr|parenleftCv1/u1D6C6̇/u1D6C6̇/ε.st|parenriµhtCv1 is the Euclidean norm of the total strain rate ten sor if 
VP = 0 (default), otherwise |u1D7≠≠̇|eCst /f.st/f.st= |u1D7≠≠̇|eCst /f.st/f.st|u1D4JDCst. 
2.  Yield Stress Tables.  The dependence of the yield stresses on the eﬀecti ve 
plastic strains is given in two tables. 
a)  TABIDC gives the behaviour of the yield stresses i n compression 
b)  TABIDT gives the behaviour of the yield stresses i n tension. 
The table indices consist of temperatures, and at e ach temperature a yield 
stress curve must be deﬁned. 
Both TABIDC and TABIDT can be 3D tables, in which t emperatures indexes 
the main table and strain rates are deﬁned as value s for the sub tables with 
hardening curves as targets for those strain rates.  If the same yield stress 
should be used in both tension and compression, onl y one table needs to be 
deﬁned and the same TABID is put in position 1 and 2 on Card 2. If VP = 0, 
eﬀective total strain rates are used in the 3D tabl es, otherwise plastic strain 
rates. 
3.  History Variables.   Two history variables are added to the d3plot  ﬁle, the 
Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio, respective ly.  They can be requested 
through the *DATABASE_EXTENT_BINARY keyword. 
4.  Nodal Temperatures.   Nodal temperatures must be deﬁned by using a 
coupled analysis or some other way to deﬁne the tem peratures, such as 
*LOAD_THERMAL_VARIABLE or *LOAD_THERMAL_LOAD_CURVE.*
