  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID.  Card 2 is ignored with this option.   
Load Curve ID.  The load curve ID deﬁ nes eﬀective stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain.  For this load  curve case, 
viscoplasticity is modeled when the coeﬃcients |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst and |u1D449|u1D4JACst are 
provided. 
Table ID.  The table consists of stress as a function of eﬀect ive 
plastic strain curves indexed by strain rate.  See Figure M24-1 . 
FLAG.EQ.1:  Table is used to calculate the coeﬃcients |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst and 
|u1D449|u1D4JACst. 
FLAG.EQ.4:  Table is interpolated and used directly.  This 
option is available only for solid elements. 
ALPHA |u1D6F+ distribution of hardening used in the curve-ﬁtting . |u1D6F+=0 is pure 
kinematic hardening while |u1D6F+ = 1  provides pure isotropic 
hardening.

where |u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain and |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain rate.  For 
shells the anisotropic behavior is given by |u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst , |u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst  and |u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst .  The model will work when 
the three ﬁrst parameters in Card 3 are given value s.  When |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst= 0, the material will 
behave elasto-plastically.  Default values are give n by: 
|u1D439 = |u1D43A =/u1D4:B=1

yield stress with the factor:
