 Oriﬁce Cards.   Include one card per oriﬁce.  Read in up to 15 oriﬁ ce locations.  The 
next keyword (“*”) card terminates this input.  On the ﬁrst card below the optional 
input parameters SF and DF may be speciﬁed.

Figure M69-1.   Mathematical model for the Side Impact Dummy damper. *.   
 force as a function of displacement curve at consta nt relative velocity is shown in Figure 
M69-2 . 
 
The factor, SF, which scales the force defaults to 1.0 and is analogous to the adjusting 
ring on the damper. *
