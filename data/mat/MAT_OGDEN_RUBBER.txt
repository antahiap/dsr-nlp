Variable TBHYS

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
TBHYS Table ID for hysteresis, could be positive or negat ive; see 
Remarks 1  and 2 in the manual page for *.   *.   
 Optional Viscoelastic Constants Cards.   Up to 12 cards may be input.  The next 
keyword (“*”) card terminates this input if fewer t han 12 cards are used.

Variable Gi BETA i VFLAG

Default none none 0      
 
 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
Gi Optional shear relaxation modulus for the ith  term.  Not used if 
LCID2 is given. 
BETA i Optional decay constant if ith  term.  Not used if LCID2 is given. 
VFLAG Flag for the viscoelasticity formulation.  This app ears only on the 
ﬁrst line deﬁning G i, BETA i, and VFLAG. If VFLAG = 0, the 
standard viscoelasticity formulation is used (the d efault), and if 
VFLAG = 1 (only applicable to solid elements), the viscoela sticity 
formulation using the instantaneous elastic stress is used. 
Remarks: 
Rubber is generally considered to be fully incompre ssible since the bulk modulus 
greatly exceeds the shear modulus in magnitude.  To  model the rubber as an 
unconstrained material, a hydrostatic work term is included in the strain energy 
functional that is a function of the relative volum e, /u1D4:D, [Ogden 1984]: 
/u1D44A∗= |summationCv1 |summationCv1|u1D7≠7|u1D4J7Cst

The asterisk (*) indicates that the volumetric eﬀec ts have been eliminated from the 
principal stretches,  |u1D7≠6|u1D4J7Cst∗.  The number of terms, |u1D4JB, may vary from 1 to 8 inclusive, and |u1D43∆ is 
the bulk modulus. 
 
Rate eﬀects are taken into account through linear v iscoelasticity by a convolution 
integral of the form: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D461Cst
