  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
E Young’s modulus used in tension.  For implicit prob lems E is set 
to the initial slope of load curve LCID. 
LCID Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) for nominal stress as a 
function of strain 
TC Tension cut-oﬀ stress 
HU Hysteretic unloading factor between 0 and 1 (def ault = 1, that is, 
no energy dissipation); see Figure M57-1  and Remark 3 .   
BETA |u1D6FD, decay constant to model creep in unloading (see Remark 3 ) 
EQ.0.0: no relaxation 
DAMP Viscous coeﬃcient (.05 < recommended value <.50) to model 
damping eﬀects. 
LT.0.0: |DAMP|  is the load curve ID which deﬁnes the damping 
constant as a function of the maximum strain in com - 
pression deﬁned as:  
|u1D7≠≠|mCst|aCst|xCst = max(1 − |u1D7≠6|oneCst, 1 − |u1D7≠6|twoCst, 1. −|u1D7≠6|threeCst)  . 
In tension, the damping constant is set to the valu e cor- 
responding to the strain at 0. The abscissa sh ould be 
deﬁned from 0 to 1.

HU.  SHAPE less than one reduces the energy dissipa tion and 
greater than one increases dissipation; see Figure M57-1 .

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCID3 Load curve ID giving the magnitude of the shear mod ulus as a 
function of the frequency.  LCID3 must use the same  frequencies 
as LCID4. 
LCID4 Load curve ID giving the phase angle of the shear m odulus as a 
function of the frequency.  LCID4 must use the same  frequencies 
as LCID3. 
SCALEW Flag for the form of the frequency data: 
EQ.0: frequency is in cycles per unit time. 
EQ.1: circular frequency 
SCALEA Flag for the units of the phase angle: 
EQ.0: degrees 
EQ.1: radians *.   
 3.  Hysteretic Unloading.   When hysteretic unloading is used, the reloading will 
follow the unloading curve if the decay constant, |u1D6FD, is set to zero.  If |u1D6FD is non- 
zero, the decay to the original loading curve is go verned by the expression: 
1 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st |u1D461Cst  
The bulk viscosity, which generates a rate dependen t pressure, may cause an 
unexpected volumetric response and, consequently, i t is optional with this 
model. 
The hysteretic unloading factor results in the unlo ading curve to lie beneath 
the loading curve as shown in Figure M57-1 .  This unloading provides energy 
dissipation which is reasonable in certain kinds of  foam. *
