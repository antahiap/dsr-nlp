diﬀerent ways: 
• If DFAILT is zero, failure occurs if the Chang-Ch ang failure criterion is 
satisﬁed in the tensile ﬁber mode. 
• If DFAILT is greater than zero, failure occurs if : 
◦ the ﬁber strain is greater than DFAILT or less th an DFAILC 
◦ if absolute value of matrix strain is greater tha n DFAILM 
◦ if absolute value of tensorial shear strain is gr eater than DFAILS 
• If EFS is greater than zero, failure occurs if th e eﬀective strain is greater

major Poisson's ratio will be equal to PRBA*(EA/EB) .  If EB > EA, then PRBA 
is the major Poisson's ratio.  PRCA and PRCB are si milarly deﬁned.  They are 
the minor Poisson’s ratio if EA>EC or EB>EC, and th e major Poisson’s ratio if 
the EC>EA or EC>EB.

deﬁnition used in LS-DYNA. For the direction indice s used in LS-DYNA see
