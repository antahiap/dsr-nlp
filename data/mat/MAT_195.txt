Remarks: 
The stress strain behavior may be treated using a b ilinear stress strain curve through 
deﬁning the tangent modulus, ETAN. An eﬀective stre ss as a function of eﬀective 
plastic strain curve (LCSS) may be input instead of  deﬁning ETAN.  The cost is roughly 
the same for either approach.  The most general app roach is to use the table deﬁnition 
(LCSS) discussed below. 
 
Three options to account for strain rate eﬀects are  possible. 
1.  Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate.  |u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
2.  For complete generality a load curve (LCSR) to sca le the yield stress may be 
input instead.  In this curve the scale factor as a  function of strain rate is de- 
ﬁned. 
3.  If diﬀerent stress as a function of strain curves can be provided for various 
strain rates, the option using the reference to a t able (LCSS) can be used. *
