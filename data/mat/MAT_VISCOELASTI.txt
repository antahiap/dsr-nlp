This is Material Type 134.  The viscoelastic fabric  model is a variation on the general 
viscoelastic model of material 76.  This model is v alid for 3 and 4 node membrane 
elements only and is strongly recommended for model ing isotropic viscoelastic fabrics 
where wrinkling may be a problem.  For thin fabrics , buckling can result in an inability 
to support compressive stresses; thus, a ﬂag is inc luded for this option.  If bending 
stresses are important use a shell formulation with  model 76.

 For an example of a stress relaxation curve see Figure M134-1 . This curve deﬁnes stress 
as a function of time where time is deﬁned on a log arithmic scale.  For best results, the 
points deﬁned in the load curve should be equally s paced on the logarithmic scale.  
Furthermore, the load curve should be smooth and de ﬁned in the positive quadrant.  If 
nonphysical values are determined by least squares ﬁt, LS-DYNA will terminate with 
an error message after the initialization phase is completed.  If the ramp time for 
loading is included, then the relaxation which occu rs during the loading phase is taken 
into account.  This eﬀect may or may not be importa nt. 10n10n+110n+210n+3σ∕ε0

Figure M234-3.   Three-element visvoelasticity model *. C).  In Figure M275-1  a stress relaxation 
is shown for a strain controlled problem using two HJR elements and normalized 
material parameters using a bulk modulus of |u1D43∆ = 1 . For the ﬁrst element |u1D43A = 0.5  and 
for the other |u1D43A = 1  while |u1D44∆|zeroCst varies; all other parameters are zero.  The engine ering strain 
is ramped to 50 %  from |u1D461 = 0  to |u1D461 = 1  and then kept constant.  The response is very 
similar to other viscoelastic models in LS-DYNA. No t surprisingly, a HJR element with 
|u1D44∆|zeroCst> 0 (and |u1D44∆|oneCst= |u1D44F|oneCst= 0) will always relax to zero stress, which follows f rom ( M275.1 ) 
and ( M275.2 ); thus the relaxed stress in this case comes from the purely elastic element.  
A general viscoelastic material can be obtained by putting several such HJR elements in 
parallel, in analogy to *
