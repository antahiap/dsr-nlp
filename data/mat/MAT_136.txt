LCID Load curve ID or Table ID.  If deﬁned, SYS, SIP, SH S, SHL, ESH,

Load Curve.   When LCID is a load curve ID, it is taken as 
deﬁning eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀective p lastic strain.  
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the stress as a function eﬀect ive plastic strain

strain rates is used by default. 
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   A way to invoke logarithmic 
interpolation between discrete strain rates is desc ribed as follows.  
If the ﬁrst  value in the table is negative, LS-DY NA assumes that 
all the table values represent the natural logarith m of a strain rate.  *.

The Vegter yield locus is section-wise deﬁned by qu adratic Bézier interpolation

principal plane stress space; see Figure M136-1 .
