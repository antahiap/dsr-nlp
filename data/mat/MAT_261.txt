  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
AOPT Material axes option (see *MAT _OPTION TROPIC_ELASTIC for a 
more complete description): 
EQ.0.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes 1, 2, and 4, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_ NODES.  For shells only, the material axes are 
then rotated about the shell element normal by an a n- 
gle MANGLE. 
EQ.1.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y a 
point in space and the global location of the eleme nt 
center; this is the |u1D44∆-direction.  This option is for solid 
elements only. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle (MANGLE) from a line in the plane of the e l- 
ement deﬁned by the cross product of the vector /u1D42F with 
the element normal. 
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D4JD, which deﬁne the centerline ax- 
is.  This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VEC TOR).  Available in R3 version of 971 
and later. 
DAF Flag to control failure of an integration point based on 
longitudinal (ﬁber) tensile failure: 
EQ.0.0: Integration point fails if any damage variable reac hes 
1.0. 
EQ.1.0: No failure of integration point due to ﬁber tensile  
failure.  This condition corresponds to history var iable 
“da( i)” reaching 1.0.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
described as follows.  If the ﬁrst  value in the table is negative, LS-
DY NA assumes that all the table values represent the natural 
logarithm of a strain rate.  Since the tables are i nternally 
discretized to equally space the table values, it m akes good sense 
from an accuracy standpoint that the table values represent the 
natural log of strain rate when the lowest strain r ate and highest 
strain rate diﬀer by several orders of magnitude.  There is some 
additional computational cost associated with invok ing 
logarithmic interpolation. 
BETA Hardening parameter for in- plane shear plasticity 
(0.0 ≤ BETA ≤ 1.0). 
EQ.0.0: Pure kinematic hardening 
EQ.1.0: Pure isotropic hardening 
0.0 < BETA < 1.0: Mixed hardening 
PFL Percentage of shell or tshell layers which must fai l until 
crashfront is initiated.  For example, if |PFL|  = 80.0, then 80% of 
layers must fail until strengths are reduced in nei ghboring 
elements.  Default: all layers must fail.  A single  layer fails if 1 in-
plane integration point fails (PFL > 0) or if 4 in- plane integration 
points fail (PFL < 0). 
PUCK Flag for evaluation and post-processing of Puc k’s inter-ﬁber-
failure criterion (IFF); see Puck, Kopp and Knops [ 2002]. 
EQ.0.0: No evaluation of Puck’s IFF-criterion. 
EQ.1.0: Puck’s IFF-criterion will be evaluated. 
SOFT Softening reduction factor for material strength in  crashfront 
elements (default = 1.0) 
DT Strain rate averaging option: 
EQ.0.0: Strain rate is evaluated using a running average. 
LT.0.0: Strain rate is evaluated using an average of the la st 11 
time steps. 
GT.0.0: Strain rate is averaged over the last DT time units . *.

2.  Damage Evolution.   As long as the stress state is located within the  failure 
surface, the model behaves in an orthotropic elasti c manner.  When reaching 
the failure criteria, the eﬀective (undamaged) stre sses will be reduced by a 
factor of (1 − |u1D4J1) , where the damage variable |u1D4J1 represents one of the damage 
variables deﬁned for the diﬀerent failure mechanism s ( |u1D4J1da , |u1D4J1k in k , |u1D4J1mat ). The 
growth of these damage variables is driven by a lin ear damage evolution law 
based on fracture toughnesses ( /u1D6E4 → ENKINK, ENA, ENB, ENT, ENL) and a 
characteristic internal element length, /u1D4:F, to account for objectivity.  See Figure
