Remarks: 
Resistance to deformation is both temperature and s train rate dependent.  The ﬂow 
stress equation is: 
|u1D7≠∆ =1
|u1D6F+sinh −|oneCst
⎣⎢⎡|parenleftCvJ|u1D44D
|u1D434|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D441Cst
⎦⎥⎤ 
where |u1D44D, the Zener-Holloman temperature compensated strain rate, is: 
|u1D44D = max(|u1D7≠≠̇,EPS0) × exp |parenleftCvJ|u1D444
GT |parenriµhtCvJ  . 
The units of the material constitutive constants ar e as follows: |u1D434 (1/sec), /u1D441 
(dimensionless), |u1D6F+ (1/MPa), the activation energy for ﬂow, |u1D444(J/mol), and the universal 
gas constant, |u1D43A (J/mol K).  The value of |u1D43A will only vary with the unit system chosen.  
Typically, it will be either 8.3144 J/(mol K), or 4 0.8825 lb in/(mol R). 
 
The ﬁnal equation necessary to complete our descrip tion of high strain rate deformation 
is one that allows us to compute the temperature ch ange during the deformation.  In the 
absence of a coupled thermo-mechanical ﬁnite elemen t code we assume adiabatic 
temperature change and follow the empirical assumpt ion that 90-95% of the plastic 
work is dissipated as heat.  Thus, the heat generat ion coeﬃcient is 
H C ≈0.9
|u1D7≠+|u1D436|u1D463Cst 
where |u1D7≠+ is the density of the material and |u1D436|u1D463Cst is the speciﬁc heat. *
