AOPT Material axes option (see MAT _OPTION TROPIC_ELASTIC for a 
more complete description): 
EQ.0.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes 1, 2, and 4, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_NODES, and then rotated about the shell ele- 
ment normal by the angle BETA. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR. 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector /u1D42F with the 
element normal. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system ID 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR).

 Because this is a resultant formulation, no stresse s are output to d3plot , and forces and 
moments are reported to elout  in place of stresses. *
