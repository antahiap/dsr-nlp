This is  Material Type 197 for discrete beam elements.  Slid ing (pendulum) and 
elastomeric seismic isolation bearings can be model ed, applying bi-directional coupled 
plasticity theory.  The hysteretic behavior was pro posed by Wen [1976] and Park, Wen, 
and Ang [1986].  The sliding bearing behavior is re commended by Zayas, Low and 
Mahin [1990].  The algorithm used for implementatio n was presented by  Nagarajaiah, 
Reinhorn, and Constantinou [1991].  Further options  for tension-carrying friction 
bearings are as recommended by Roussis and Constant inou [2006].  Element 
formulation type 6 must  be used.  Local axes are deﬁned on *SECTION_BEAM; the 
default is the global axis system.  The local /u1D46̅-axis is expected to be vertical.  On *SEC-
TION_BEAM SCOOR must be set to zero when using this  material model, even if the 
element has non-zero initial length.

Remarks: 
1.  Horizontal Behavior of the Isolator.   The horizontal behavior for all isolator 
types is governed by plastic history variables Zx a nd Zy that evolve according 
to equations given in the reference; A, GAMMA, BETA  and DISPYt are the 
input parameters for this.  The intention is to pro vide smooth build-up, rota- 
tion and reversal of forces in response to bidirect ional displacement histories in *.   
 c)  ITYPE = 3 is used to model Lead Rubber Bearings (L RB), made of rubber 
with a lead core. Phenomenological models following  Kumar et al.  (2014) 
are incorporated to simulate the following salient behavior:  
i)  The properties of the lead core may degrade in the  short-term be- 
cause of substantial internal heat generation from cyclic defor- 
mation. 
ii)  Under larger lateral deformation, the rubber may e xperience net 
tension which will aﬀect the compression and tensio n stiﬀness, 
and lead to potential vertical instability. 
iii)  Cavitation may happen when the bearing is under ex cessive ten- 
sion, resulting in permanent damage in the tensile capacity. 
d)  ITYPE  =  4 is used to model higher damping rubber  bearings.  It diﬀers 
from elastomeric bearing (ITYPE  =  1) in that the time-varying yield force 
is a function of resultant horizontal displacement,  governed by: 
Y ield force = FORCE Y 
⎝⎜⎜⎛1 + BETA |parenleftCv6|u1D4J1|u1D46J |twoCst+ |u1D4J1|u1D466 |twoCst
DISP Y |twoCst|parenriµhtCv6
⎠⎟⎟⎞  . 
Here |u1D4J1|u1D46J  and |u1D4J1|u1D466  are the displacements in the local |u1D46J and |u1D466 directions. 
e)  ITYPE = 5 is the same as ITYPE = 0 (spherical slid ing bearing), except for 
the additional capability of yielding and failure o f the rim, also called the 
retaining ring.  The rim is intended to prevent the  radial displacement of 
the slider exceeding RADB, but if suﬃcient radial f orce is applied, the rim 
can yield and then fail, leading to the slider fall ing oﬀ the supporting sur- 
face.  When the rim fails, the isolator element is deleted.   
6.  Damping. DAMP is the fraction of critical damping for free v ertical vibration 
of the isolator, based on the mass of the isolator (including any attached 
lumped masses) and its vertical stiﬀness.  The visc osity is reduced automatical- 
ly if it would otherwise infringe numerical stabili ty.  Damping is generally 
recommended:  
a)  Oscillations in the vertical force have a direct e ﬀect on friction forces in 
sliding isolators. 
b)  For isolators with curved surfaces, vertical oscil lations can be excited as 
the isolator slides up and down the curved surface.   
It may occasionally be necessary to increase DAMP i f these oscillations become 
signiﬁcant. *.   
 e)  By default, the isolator will be assumed to rotate  with the average rotation 
of its two nodes.  If the base of the column rotate s slightly the isolator will 
no longer be perfectly horizontal: this can cause u nexpected vertical dis- 
placements coupled with the horizontal motion.  To avoid this, rotation of 
the local axes of the isolator can be eliminated by  setting RRCON, SR-
CON, and TRCON to 1.0. This does not introduce any rotational restraint 
to the model, it only prevents the orientation of t he isolator from changing 
as the model deforms. 
f)  SCOOR must be set to zero. 
g)  All other parameters on *SECTION_BEAM can be left blank. 
10.  Post-Processing Note. As with other discrete beam material models, the 
force described in some post-processors as “Axial” is really the force in the 
local |u1D46J-direction; “Y-Shear” is really the force in the lo cal |u1D466-direction; and “Z-
Shear” is really the force in the local /u1D46̅-direction. *
