This is  Material Type 14 for discrete elements (*ELEMENT_DI SCRETE).  This material 
allows squat shear walls to be modeled using discre te elements.  The behavior model 
captures concrete cracking, reinforcement yield, ul timate strength followed by 
degradation of strength ﬁnally leading to collapse.

Remarks: 
Material coeﬃcients |u1D434, |u1D43J, |u1D436 and |u1D437 are empirically deﬁned constants used to deﬁne the  
shape of the polynomial curves which govern the cyc lic behavior of the discrete 
element.  A diﬀerent polynomial relationship is use d to deﬁne the loading and 
unloading paths allowing energy absorption through hysteresis.  Coeﬃcient |u1D438 is used in 
the deﬁnition of the path used to “jump” from the l oading path to the unloading path 
(or vice versa) when a full hysteresis loop is not completed.  The load curve referenced 
is used to deﬁne the force displacement characteris tics of the shear wall under 
monotonic loading.  The polynomials deﬁning the cyc lic behavior refer to this curve.  
On the second and subsequent loading / unloading cy cles, the shear wall will have 
reduced strength.  The variable FSD is the sustaine d strength reduction factor. *
