This is  Material Type 195 for beam elements.  An elasto-pla stic material with an 
arbitrary stress as a function of strain curve and arbitrary strain rate dependency can be 
deﬁned.  Failure based on a plastic strain or a min imum time step size can be deﬁned.

characters must be speciﬁed.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
E Young’s modulus 
PR Poisson’s ratio 
SIGY Yield stress 
ETAN Tangent modulus; ignored if LCSS > 0  
FAIL Failure ﬂag: 
LT.0.0: user deﬁned failure subroutine is called to determine 
failure. 
EQ.0.0: failure is not considered.  This option is recommen ded 
if failure is not of interest since many calculatio ns will 
be saved. 
GT.0.0: plastic strain to failure.  When the plastic strain  reach es 
this value, the element is deleted from the calcula tion. 
TDEL Minimum time step size for automatic element d eletion. 
C Strain rate parameter, |u1D436; see Remarks below. 
P Strain rate parameter, |u1D4JD; see Remarks below. 
LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID.  Load curve ID deﬁning e ﬀective 
stress as a function of eﬀective plastic strain.  T he table ID deﬁnes 
for each strain rate value a load curve ID giving t he stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain for that rate; see Figure M16-1
Stress as a function of eﬀective plastic strain cur ve for the lowest 
value of strain rate is used if the strain rate fal ls below the 
minimum value.  Likewise, the stress as a function of eﬀective 
plastic strain curve for the highest value of strai n rat e is used if 
the strain rate exceeds the maximum value.  The str ain rate 
parameters ( |u1D436 and |u1D4JD) and the curve ID, LC SR, are ignored if a 
Table ID is deﬁned. 
LCSR Load curve ID deﬁning strain rate scaling eﬀec t on yield stress 
NOTEN No-tension ﬂag: 
EQ.0: beam takes tension. 
EQ.1: beam takes no tension. 
EQ.2: beam takes tension up to value given by TENCUT. *
