 ordinate system axes can rotate with either node of  the beam or an average 
rotation of both nodes (see SCOOR variable in *SECT ION_BEAM). 
2.  Null Stiffness.   For null stiﬀness coeﬃcients, no forces correspon ding to these 
null values will develop.  The viscous damping coeﬃ cients are optional. 
3.  Rotational Displacement.   Rotational displacement is measured in radians. *
