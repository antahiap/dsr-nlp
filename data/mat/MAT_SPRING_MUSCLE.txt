 limitations, the Hill model has become extremely us eful for modeling musculoskeletal 
dynamics, as illustrated by its widespread use toda y. 
 
 
 
When the contractile element (CE) of the Hill model  is inactive, the entire resistance to 
elongation is provided by the PE element and the te ndon load-elongation behavior.  As 
activation is increased, force then passes through the CE side of the parallel Hill model, 
providing the contractile dynamics.  The original H ill model accommodated only full 
activation - this limitation is circumvented in the  present implementation by using the 
modiﬁcation suggested by Winters (1990).  The main features of his approach were to 
realize that the CE force-velocity input force equa ls the CE tension-length output force.  
This yields a three-dimensional curve to describe t he force-velocity-length relationship 
of the CE.  If the force-velocity |u1D466-intercept scales with activation, then given the 
activation, length and velocity, the CE force can b e determined. 
 
Without the SEE, the total force in the muscle FM i s the sum of the force in the CE and 
the PE because they are in parallel: 
|u1D439/M.st= |u1D439/P.st/E.st + |u1D439/C.st/E.st   . 
The relationships deﬁning the force generated by th e CE and PE as a function of /u1D4:FM 
(length of the muscle), |u1D449M (shortening velocity of the muscle) and |u1D44∆(|u1D461) are often scaled 
by |u1D439max , the peak isometric force (p.  80, Winters 1990), /u1D4:F|zeroCst, the initial length of the 
muscle (p.  81, Winters 1990), and |u1D449max , the maximum unloaded CE shortening velocity 
(p.  80, Winters 1990).  From these, dimensionless length and velocity can be deﬁned as: CE a(t) LM

Figure  MS15-1.   Discrete model for muscle contraction dynamics, based o n a 
Hill-type representation.  The total force is the sum of passive force |u1D439PE  and 
active force |u1D439CE .  The passive element (PE) represents energy storag e from 
muscle e lasticity, while the contractile element (CE) represen ts force 
generation by the muscle.  The series elastic element (SEE), shown in dashed 
lines, is often neglected when a series tendon compli ance is included.  Here,

The active tension-velocity relationship |u1D4J3T V (|u1D449) used in the muscle model is mainly due 
to the original work of Hill.  Note that the dimens ionless velocity |u1D449 is used.  When |u1D449 =
0.0, the normalized tension is typically chosen to hav e a value of 1.0.  When |u1D449 is greater 
than or equal to 0.0, muscle lengthening occurs.  A s |u1D449 increases, the function is typically 
designed so that the force increases from a value o f 1.0 and asymptotes towards a value 
near 1.4 ass shown in Figure MS15-2 .  When |u1D449 is less than zero, muscle shortening 
occurs and the classic Hill equation hyperbola is u sed to drop the normalized tension to 
0.0 as shown in Figure MS15-2 .  The user must specify the function |u1D4J3T V (|u1D449) using a load 
curve, specifying pairs of points representing the normalized tension (with values 
between 0.0 and 1.0) and normalized velocity |u1D449.
