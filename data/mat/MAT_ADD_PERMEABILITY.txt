2-114 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
a function of eﬀective pressure ( |u1D46J-axis) which is posi- 
tive when in compression . 
Remarks: 
1.  Permeability Units.  The units of PERM are length/time (volume ﬂow rate of 
water per unit area per gradient of pore pressure h ead). 
2.  Thermal Expansion.  THEXP represents the thermal expansion of the mater ial 
caused by the pore ﬂuid (units: 1/temperature). It should be set equal to |u1D4JB|u1D6F+|u1D464Cst, 
where |u1D4JB is the porosity of the soil and |u1D6F+|u1D464Cst is the volumetric thermal expansion 
coeﬃcient of the pore ﬂuid.  If the pore ﬂuid is wa ter, the thermal expansion 
coeﬃcient varies strongly with temperature; a curve  of coeﬃcient as a function 
of temperature may be input instead of a constant v alue. Note that this proper- 
ty is for volumetric  strain increase, whereas regular thermal expansion  coeﬃ- 
cients (e.g. on *MAT or *
