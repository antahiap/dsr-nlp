  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
NATE_NODES, and then rotated about the shell ele- 
ment normal by an angle MANGLE 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_ECTOR 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, MANGLE, from a line in the plane of the e l- 
ement deﬁned by the cross product of the vector /u1D42F with 
the element normal 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VEC TOR).  Available in R3 version of 971 
and later. 
MANGLE Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 0 and 3, may be overridden 
on the element card; see *ELEMENT_SHELL_BETA. 
A1 A2 A3 Deﬁne components of vector /u1D41A for AOPT = 2 
V1 V2 V3 Deﬁne components of vector /u1D42F for AOPT = 3 
D1 D2 D3 Deﬁne components of vector /u1D41D for AOPT = 2 
Remarks: 
See material types 2 and 24 for the orthotropic deﬁ nition. *
