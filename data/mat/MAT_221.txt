  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
BETA Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 3, may be overridden on 
the element card, see  *ELEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO. 
NERODE Element erosion ﬂag.  For multi- integration point elements, each 
of the failure strains mentioned below for NERODE 2  and higher 
need only occur in one integration point to trigger  element 
erosion, and for NERODE valu es 6 to 11,  which require more 
than one failure strain be reached, those failure s trains need not 
occur in the same integration point.   
EQ.0: No erosion (default). 
EQ.1: Erosion occurs when one failure strain is reached i n all 
integration points.  
EQ.2: Erosion occurs when one failure strain is reached.  
EQ.3: Erosion occurs when a tension or compr ession failure 
strain in the |u1D44∆-direction is reached. 
EQ.4: Erosion occurs when as a tension or compression failure 
strain in the |u1D44F-direction is reached. 
EQ.5: Erosion occurs when a tension or compression failure 
strain in the /u1D450-direction is reached. 
EQ.6: Erosion occurs when tension or compression failure 
strain in both the |u1D44∆- and |u1D44F-directions are reached. 
EQ.7: Erosion occurs when tension or compression failure 
strain in both the |u1D44F- and /u1D450-directions are reached. 
EQ.8: Erosion occurs when tension or compression failure 
strain in both the |u1D44∆- and /u1D450-directions are reached. 
EQ.9: Erosion occurs when tension or compression failure 
strain in all 3 directions are reached.  
EQ.10: Erosion occurs when tension or compression failure 
strain in both the |u1D44∆- and |u1D44F-directions are reached and 
either of the out-of-plane failure shear strains (b c or ac) is 
reached.  .  
EQ.11: Erosion occurs when tension failure strain in eithe r the |u1D44∆-
or |u1D44F-directions is reached and either of the out-of-pla ne 
failure shear strains (bc or ac) is reached. *.

Remarks: 
If |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J≠Cst< |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D46≠Cst , no damage is considered.  Failure occurs only whe n failure strain is reached. 
Failure can occur along the 3 orthotropic direction s, in tension, in compression and for 
shear behavior.  Nine failure strains drive the fai lure.  When failure occurs, elements are 
deleted (erosion).  Under the control of the NERODE  ﬂag, failure may occur either 
when only one integration point has failed, when se veral integration points have failed 
or when all integrations points have failed. *.
