2-360 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCRBI Load curve deﬁning biaxial R- value vs.  biaxial strain, see 
discussion in the Remarks below for a deﬁnition.  D efault is a 
constant R-value of 1.0, a negative input will result in a constant 
R-value of –LCRBI. 
LCRSH Load curve deﬁning shear R- value vs.  shear strain, see discussion 
in the Remarks below for a deﬁnition.  Default is a  constant R-
value of 1.0, a negative input will result in a con stant R-value of –
LCRSH. 
M Barlat ﬂow exponent, |u1D4JA, must be an integer value.

2-362 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 These curves are transformed internally to be used with the eﬀective stress and strain 
properties in the actual model.  The eﬀective plast ic strain does not coincide with the 
plastic strain components in other directions than the rolling direction and may be 
somewhat confusing to the user.  Therefore the von Mises work equivalent plastic strain 
is output as history variable #2. As for hardening,  the optional biaxial and shear R-value 
curves LCRBI and LCRSH are deﬁned in a special way for which we return to the local 
plastic strain tensor /u1D̅:A as deﬁned above.  The biaxial and shear R-values a re deﬁned as 
|u1D44J|u1D44FCst/|u1D46≠Cst=|u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst
|u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst 
and again the curves are |u1D44J|u1D44FCst/|u1D46≠Cst as function of |u1D7≠≠|oneCst+|u1D7≠≠|twoCst. Note here that the suﬃx |u1D44F assumes 
loading biaxially and |u1D46≠ assumes loading in shear, so the R-values to be de ﬁned are 
always positive. 
 
The option HOSF = 0 is equivalent to the standard B arlat model with HR = 7 whose 
yield function can be expressed by the potential Φ as given in the remarks for *
