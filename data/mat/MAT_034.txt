for each strain rate a load curve representing stre ss as a function of 
uniaxial strain along the |u1D44∆-axis ﬁber.  The load c urve is available 
for FORM = 4, 14, – 14, and 24 while the table is allowed only for 
FORM = -14. If zero, EA is used.  For FORM = 14, - 14, and 24, this 
curve can be deﬁned in both tension and compression ; see 
Remark 6  below. 
LCB Load curve or table ID. Load curve ID deﬁnes the st ress as a 
function of uniaxial strain along the |u1D44F-axis ﬁber.  Table ID deﬁnes 
for each strain rate a load curve representing stre ss as a function of 
uniaxial strain along the |u1D44F-axis ﬁber.  The load curve is available 
for FORM = 4, 14, - 14, and 24 while the table is allowed only for 
FORM = -14. If zero, EB is used.  For FORM = 14, - 14, and 24, this 
curve can be deﬁned in both tension and compression ; see

LCUA Unload/reload curve ID for stress as a function of strain along the

LCUB Unload/reload curve ID for stress as a function of strain along the

LCUAB Unload/reload curve ID for shea r stress as a function of shear 
strain in the |u1D44∆|u1D44F -plane.  If zero, LCAB  is used. 
RL Optional reloading parameter for FORM = 14 and 24.  Values 
between 0.0 (reloading on unloading curve- default) and 1.0 
(reloading on a minimum linear slope between unload i ng curve 
and loading curve) are possible . *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-315 (MAT) The no compression option can allow elements to col lapse to a line which can 
lead to elements becoming tangled.  The elastic lin er option is one way to add 
some stiﬀness in compression to prevent this, see Remark 4 .  Alternatively, 
when using fabric formulations 14, -14, or 24 (see FORM) tangling can be re- 
duced by deﬁning stress/strain curves that include negative strain and stress 
values.  See Remark 6 . 
2.  Porosity.   The parameters FLC and FAC are optional for the W ang-Nefske and 
Hybrid inﬂation models.  It is possible for the air bag to be constructed of mul- 
tiple fabrics having diﬀerent values for porosity a nd permeability.  Typically, 
FLC and FAC must be determined experimentally and t heir variations in time 
or with pressure are optional to allow for maximum ﬂexibility. 
3.  Effects of Airbag-Structure Interaction on Porosity .   To calculate the 
leakage of gas through the fabric it is necessary t o accurately determine the 
leakage area.  The dynamics of the airbag may cause  the leakage area to change 
during the course of the simulation.  In particular , the deformation may change 
the leakage area, but the leakage area may also dec rease when the contact be- 
tween the airbag and the structure blocks the ﬂow.  LS-DYNA can check the 
interaction of the bag with the structure and split  the areas into regions that are 
blocked and unblocked depending on whether the regi ons are in or not in con- 
tact, respectively.  Blockage eﬀects may be control led with the ELA ﬁeld. 
4.  Elastic Liner.   An optional elastic liner can be deﬁned using EL,  PRL and LRA-
TIO.  The liner is an isotropic layer that acts in both tension and compression.  
However, setting, LNRC to 1.0 eliminates compressiv e stress in the liner until 
both principle stresses are tensile.  The compressi ve stress elimination option, 
CSE = 1 , has no inﬂuence on the liner behavior. 
5.  Fiber Axes.   For formulations 0, 1, and 2, (see FORM) the |u1D44∆-axis and |u1D44F-axis 
ﬁber directions are assumed to be orthogonal  and are completely deﬁned by the 
material axes option, AOPT = 0, 2, or 3.  For FORM = 3, 4, 13, or 14, the ﬁber 
directions are not assumed to be orthogonal  and must be speciﬁed using the 
ICOMP = 1 option on *SECTION_SHELL.  Oﬀset angles s hould be input into 
the B1 and B2 ﬁelds used normally for integration p oints 1 and 2.  The |u1D44∆-axis 
and |u1D44F-axis directions will then be oﬀset from the |u1D44∆-axis direction as determined 
by the material axis option, AOPT = 0, 2, or 3. 
When reference geometry is deﬁned, the material axe s are computed using 
coordinates from the reference geometry.  The mater ial axes are determined by 
computing the angle between the element system and the material direction. 
6.  Stress as a function of Strain Curves.   For formulations (see FORM) 4, 14, -
14, and 24, 2 nd  Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress as a function of Green’s str ain curves may 
be deﬁned for |u1D44∆-axis, |u1D44F-axis, and shear stresses for loading and also for unload- 
ing and reloading.  Alternatively, the |u1D44∆-axis and |u1D44F-axis curves can be input us- *.

When switching fabric forms or versions, the curve scale factors SFA and SFO 
on *DEFINE_CURVE can be used to oﬀset this behavior . 
9.  Per Material Venting Option.   The FVOPT ﬂag allows an airbag fabric venting 
equation to be assigned to a material.  The anticip ated use for this option is to 
allow a vent to be deﬁned using FVOPT = 1 or 2 for one material and fabric 
leakage to be deﬁned for using FVOPT = 3, 4, 5, or 6 for other materials.  In 
order to use FVOPT, a venting option must ﬁrst be d eﬁned for the airbag using 
the OPT parameter on *AIRBAG_WANG_NEFSKE or *AIRBAG _HYBRID.  If 
OPT = 0, then FVOPT is ignored.  If OPT is deﬁned a nd FVOPT is omitted, 
then FVOPT is set equal to OPT. 
10.  TSRFAC Option to Restore Element Strains.   Airbags that use a reference 
geometry will typically have nonzero strains at the  start of the calculation.  To 
prevent such initial strains from prematurely openi ng an airbag, initial strains 
are stored and subtracted from the measured strain throughout the calculation. 
/u1D̅48= |u1D4J3 (/u1D̅:A−/u1D̅:A|iCst|nCst|iCst|tCst|iCst|aCst /l.st) 
• Fabric formulations 2, 3, and 4 (see FORM) subtra ct oﬀ only the initial ten- 
sile strains so these forms are typically used with  CSE = 1 and LNRC = 1. 
• Fabric formulations 12, 13, 14, -14, and 24 subtr act oﬀ the total initial 
strains, so these forms may be used with CSE = 0 or  1 and LNRC = 0 or 1.  
A side eﬀect of this strain modiﬁcation is that air bags may not achieve the 
correct volume when they open.  Therefore, the TSRF AC option is imple- *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-319 (MAT) tions can be used without setting CSE = 1 and LNRC = 1 since compressive 
stress cutoﬀ is not needed to prevent initial airba g movement.  Formulations 2, 
3, and 4 need compressive stress cutoﬀ when used wi th a reference geometry 
or they can generate compressive stress at the star t of a calculation.  Available 
for formulation 12 only, the ISREFG parameter activ ates an option to calculate 
the initial stress by using a reference geometry. 
Material formulation 24 is an enhanced version of f ormulation 14 implement- 
ing a correction for Poisson’s eﬀects when stress a s a function of strain curves 
are input for the |u1D44∆-ﬁber or |u1D44F-ﬁber.  Also, for formulation 24, the outputted 
stress and strain in the elout  or d3plot  database ﬁles is engineering stress and 
strain rather than the 2 nd  Piola Kirchoﬀ and Green’s strain used by formula- 
tions other than 0 and 1. 
12.  Noise Reduction for the Strain Rate Measure.   If tables are used, then the 
strain rate measure is the time derivative of the G reen-Lagrange strain in the 
direction of interest.  To suppress noise, the stra in rate is averaged according to 
the value of DT.  If DT > 0, it is recommended to u se a large enough value to 
suppress the noise, while being small enough to not  lose important infor- 
mation in the signal. 
13.  Hysteresis.   The hysteresis parameter /u1D4:B deﬁnes the fraction of dissipated 
energy during a load cycle in terms of the maximum possible dissipated ener- 
gy.  Referring to the Figure M34-1 , Figure M34-1.  A1 A2

Remarks: 
1.  Material Model.   This material model invokes a special membrane el ement 
formulation regardless of the element choice.  It i s an anisotropic hyperelastic 
model where the 2 nd  Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress  /u1D412 is a function of the Green-
Lagrange strain /u1D404 and possibly its history.  Due to anisotropy, this  strain is 
transformed to obtain the strains in each of the ﬁb er directions, |u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st  and |u1D438/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st , 
together with the shear strain, |u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st . The associated stress components in the 
local system are given as functions of the strain c omponents 
|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st =γ|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st (|u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D438/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st )ϑ
|u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st =γ|u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D438/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st , |u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st )ϑ
|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st =γ|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st )ϑ 
The factor |u1D6F∆ is used for dissipative eﬀects and is described in  more detail in 
Remark 4 .  For TH = 0, |u1D6F∆ = 1 .  The function ϑ represents a strain rate scale fac- 
tor (see Remark 6 ); for FXX = FYY = 0 this factor is 1. While the sh ear relation is 
given directly in the input through the curve SXY, the tabular input of the ﬁber 
stress components PXX and PYY is for the sake of co nvenience.  PXX and PYY 
give the engineering stress as function of engineer ing strain, that is, 
|u1D443/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st = |u1D443/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st (|u1D4J2/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st )
|u1D443/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st = |u1D443/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st ) 
Because of this, the following conversion formulae are used between stresses 
and strains 
|u1D4J2 =/radical.v11 + 2|u1D438 − 1
|u1D446 =|u1D443
1 + |u1D4J2 
which are applied in each of the two ﬁber direction s. 
2.  Compressive Stress Elimination.   Compressive stress elimination is optional 
through the CSE parameter, and when activated the p rincipal components of 
the 2 nd  Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress is restricted to positive va lues.  
3.  Reference Geometry and Smooth Stress Initialization .  If a reference 
geometry is used, then SRFAC is the curve ID for a function |u1D6F+(|u1D461) that should 
increase from zero to unity during a short time spa n.  During this time span, *. M  
LS-DYNA R13 2-335 (MAT) /u1D44A|u1D4J≠Cst= |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cst/u1D4:D|<raceleftCvJln |parenleftCvJ/u1D4:D
/u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst|parenriµhtCvJ − 1|<raceriµhtCvJ ,  for /u1D4:D≤/u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst  . 
Here |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cst (BULKC) is a physical bulk modulus, /u1D4:D= det(/u1D405) is the jacobian of the 
deformation and /u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst (JACC) is the critical jacobian for when the eﬀect  commenc- 
es. /u1D405 is the deformation gradient.  This contributes to the pressure with a term 
|u1D4JD = |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cstln |parenleftCvJ/u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst
/u1D4:D|parenriµhtCvJ ,  for /u1D4:D≤/u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst 
and thus prevents membrane elements from collapsing  or inverting when sub- 
jected to compressive loads.  The bulk modulus |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cst should be selected with the 
slopes in the stress map tables in mind, presumably  some order of magni- 
tude(s) smaller.   
6.  Strain Rate Scale Factor.   As an option, the local membrane stress can be 
scaled based on the engineering strain rates via th e function /u1D̅1̅=/u1D̅1̅(|u1D4J2̇,/u1D412). We set 
|u1D4J2̇= max |parenleftCvJ/u1D̅16̇
‖/u1D405/u1D412‖, 0|parenriµhtCvJ 
to be the equivalent engineering strain rate in the  direction of loading and de- 
ﬁne 
/u1D̅1̅(|u1D4J2̇,/u1D4̅A) =|u1D439/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st (|u1D4J2̇)||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st | + |u1D439/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D4J2̇)||u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st | + 2||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st |
||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st | + ||u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st | + 2||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st |, 
meaning that the strain rate scale factor defaults to the user input data FXX and 
FYY for uniaxial loading in the two material direct ions, respectively.  Note that 
we only consider strain rate scaling in loading and  not in unloading, and fur- 
thermore that the strain rates used in evaluating t he curves are pre-ﬁltered 
using the time window DT to avoid excessive numeric al noise.  It is, therefore, 
recommended to set DT to a time corresponding to at  least hundred time steps 
or so. *
