 *.  for rebar reinforcement supp lemental to concrete deﬁned 
using Material type 84.  Reinforcement may be deﬁne d in speciﬁc groups of elements, 
but it is usually more convenient to deﬁne a two-di mensional material in a speciﬁed 
layer of a speciﬁed part.  Reinforcement quantity i s deﬁned as the ratio of the cross-
sectional area of steel relative to the cross-secti onal area of concrete in the element (or 
layer).  These cards may follow either one of two f ormats below and may also be 
deﬁned in any order. 
Card Summary: 
Card 1a.   Reinforcement is deﬁned in speciﬁc groups of elem ents.

Card 1b.   Reinforcement is deﬁned in two- dimensional layers by part ID.  This option is 
active when the ﬁrst entry is left blank.
