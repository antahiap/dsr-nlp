 {OPTION}  
Available options include: 
THERMAL 
3MODES 
FUNCTIONS 
This is Material Type 240.  This model is a rate-de pendent, elastic-ideally plastic 
cohesive zone model.  It includes a tri-linear trac tion-separation law with a quadratic 
yield and damage initiation criterion in mixed-mode  loading (mode I – mode II), while 
the damage evolution is governed by a power-law for mulation.  It can be used only 
with cohesive element formulations; see the variabl e ELFORM in *SECTION_SOLID 
and *SECTION_SHELL. 
With the THERMAL option, some properties are deﬁned  as functions of temperature, 
meaning ﬁelds EMOD, GMOD, G1C_0, G2C_0, T0, S0, FG1 , and FG2 must be deﬁned as 
curve IDs instead of scalar values. 
With the FUNCTIONS option, some properties are deﬁn ed as functions of connection 
partner properties, meaning ﬁelds EMOD, GMOD, G1C_0 , G2C_0, T0, S0, FG1, and FG2 
must be deﬁned as function IDs instead of scalar va lues.  See remarks for details. 
The keyword option 3MODES activates the possibility  to include deformation/fracture 
mode III which could be useful for cohesive shells.   Corresponding ﬁelds can be deﬁned 
on optional Cards 4 and 5. 
Note that 3MODES is compatible with THERMAL and FUN CTIONS, but THERMAL 
and FUNCTIONS cannot be used together.  In other wo rds, THERMAL_3MODES and 
FUNCTIONS_3MODES are allowed as keyword options, bu t THERMAL_FUNCTIONS 
is not allowed.
