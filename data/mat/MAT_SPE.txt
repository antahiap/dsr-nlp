 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
PID Part ID for which the thermal expansion propert y applies 
LCID For isotropic material models, LCID is the load cur ve ID deﬁning 
the thermal expansion coeﬃcient as a function of te mperature.  In 
this case, LCIDY, MULTY, LCIDZ, and MULTZ are ignor ed.  For 
anisotropic material models, LCID and MULT deﬁne th e thermal 
expansion coeﬃcient in the local material |u1D44∆-direction.  In either 
case, if LCID is zero, t he thermal expansion coeﬃcient is constant 
and equal to MULT. 
MULT Scale factor scaling load curve given by LCID 
LCIDY Load curve ID deﬁning the thermal expansion coeﬃcie nt in the 
local material |u1D44F-direction as a function of temperature.  If zero, t he 
thermal expansion coeﬃcient in the local material |u1D44F-direction is 
constant and equal to MULTY. If MULTY = 0 as well, LCID and 
MULT deﬁne the thermal expansion coeﬃcient in the l ocal 
material |u1D44F-direction.

LCIDZ Load curve ID deﬁning the thermal expansion coeﬃcie nt in the 
local material /u1D450-direction as a function of temperature.  If zero, t he

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
AOPT Material axes option (see MAT _{ OPTION }TROPIC_ELASTIC for 
a more complete description): 
EQ.0.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes 1, 2, and 4, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_NODES, and then rotated about the shell ele- 
ment normal by an angle BETA 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BETA, fr om a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector /u1D42F with the 
element normal 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR).

D1, D2, D3 Components of vector /u1D41D for AOPT = 2 
V1 ,V2, V3 Components of vector /u1D42F for AOPT = 3 
BETA Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 0 and 3. It may be 
overridden on the element card; see *ELEMENT_SHELL_ BETA.
