GY = 0, the following equation is used instead wher e the static stress, 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2, must be deﬁned by a load curve: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2

⎦⎥⎥⎤  . 
This latter equation is always used if the viscopla stic option is oﬀ. 
b)  For complete generality a load curve (LCSR) to sca le the yield stress may 
be input instead.  In this curve the scale factor a s a function of strain rate is 
deﬁned. 
c)  If diﬀerent stress as a function of strain curves can be provided for various 
strain rates, the option using the reference to a t able (LCSS) can be used.  
Then the table input in *DEFINE_TABLE must be used; see Figure M24-1 . 
2.  Viscoplastic Formulation.   A fully viscoplastic formulation is optional 
(variable VP = 1) which incorporates the diﬀerent o ptions above within the 
yield surface.  An additional cost is incurred over  the simple scaling, but the 
improvement in results can be dramatic. 
3.  Filtered Strain Rates.   With the option VP = 3 it is possible to use ﬁlte red 
strain rates.  This means that the total strain rat e is used as with VP = 0, but this *.   *.   
This is  Material Type 103.  This anisotropic-viscoplastic m aterial model applies to shell 
and brick elements.  The material constants may be ﬁt directly or, if desired, stress as a 
function of strain data may be input and a least sq uares ﬁt will be performed by LS-DY-
NA to determine the constants.  Kinematic, isotropi c, or a combination of kinematic and 
isotropic hardening may be used.  A detailed descri ption of this model can be found in 
the following references: Berstad, Langseth, and Ho pperstad [1994]; Hopperstad and 
Remseth [1995]; and Berstad [1996].  Failure is bas ed on eﬀective plastic strain or by a 
user deﬁned subroutine.

EQ.0: Give all material parameters 
EQ.1: Material parameters |u1D444|u1D4JFCst|oneCst, |u1D436|u1D4JFCst|oneCst, |u1D444|u1D4JFCst|twoCst, and |u1D436|u1D4JFCst|twoCst for pure 
isotropic hardening ( |u1D6F+ = 1 ) are determined by a least 
squares ﬁt to the curve or table speciﬁed by the va riable

modiﬁed by multiplying them by the factor |u1D6F+, while the

tively, for pure isotropic hardening.  |u1D436|u1D46JCst|oneCst is set equal to 
|u1D436|u1D4JFCst|oneCst and |u1D436|u1D46JCst|twoCst is set equal to |u1D436|u1D4JFCst|twoCst.  |u1D6F+ is input as variable AL-

EQ.0.0: Failure is not considered.  This option is recommen ded 
if failure is not of interest since many calculatio ns will 
be saved. 
GT.0.0: Plastic strain to failure.  When the plastic strain  reaches 
this value, the element is deleted from the calcula tion. 
NUMINT Number of integration points which must fail before  element 
deletion.  If zero, all points must fail.  This opt ion applies to shell 
elements only.  For the case of one point shells, N U MINT should 
be set to a value that is less than the number of t hrough thickness 
integration points.  Nonphysical stretching can som etimes appear 
in the results if all integration points have faile d except for one 
point away from the midsurface because unconstraine d nodal 
rotations will prevent strains from developing at t he remaining 
integration point.  In fully integrated shells, sim ilar problems can 
occur.

 To convert these constants set the viscoelastic con stants, |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst and |u1D449|u1D4JACst, to the following 
values: 
|u1D449|u1D4J8Cst= |parenleftCvJ1

|u1D4JDCst
 
|u1D449|u1D4JACst=1

If LCSS is nonzero, substitute the initial, quasi-s tatic yield stress for SIGY in the 
equation for |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst  above. 
 
This model properly treats rate eﬀects.  The viscop lastic rate formulation is an option in 
other plasticity models in LS-DYNA, such as *.  above.  This material model 
applies only to shell elements.
