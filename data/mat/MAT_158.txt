Type A F F F F F F F 
 
 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
EA |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst, Young’s modulus - longitudinal direction 
EB |u1D438|u1D44FCst, Young’s modulus - transverse direction 
(EC) |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst, Young’s modulus - normal direction (not used) 
PRBA /u1D̅08|u1D44FCst|u1D44∆Cst , Poisson’s ratio |u1D44F|u1D44∆  
TAU1 /u1D̅0F|oneCst, stress limit of the ﬁrst slightly nonlinear part  of the shear 
stress as a function of shear strain curve.  The va lues /u1D̅0F|oneCst and |u1D6F∆|oneCst are 
used to deﬁne a curve of shear stress as a function of shea r strain.  
These values are input if FS, deﬁned in Card 3, is set to -1.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector /u1D42F with the 
element normal 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR. 
TSIZE Time step for automatic element deletion 
ERODS Maximum eﬀective strain for element layer failure.  A value of 
unity would equal 100% strain. 
SOFT Softening reduction factor for strength in the  crashfront. 
FS Failure surface type: 
EQ.1.0: Smooth failure surface with a quadratic criterion f or 
both the ﬁber ( |u1D44∆) and transverse ( |u1D44F) directions.  This op- 
tion can be used with complete laminates and fabric s. 
EQ.0.0: Smooth failure surface in the transverse ( |u1D44F) direction 
with a limiting value in the ﬁber ( |u1D44∆) direction.  This 
model is appropriate for unidirectional (UD) layere d 
composites only. 
EQ.-1: Faceted failure surface.  When the strength values are 
reached, then damage evolves in tension and compres - 
sion for both the ﬁber and transverse direction.  S hear 
behavior is also considered.  This option can be us ed 
with complete laminates and fabrics.
