  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
function of pressure.  LCFP must be deﬁned if B > 0 .0. 
LCRP Load curve ID for plastic strain at which residual strength is 
reached as a function of pressure.  LCRP must be de ﬁned if 
B > 0.0. 
PC Pressure cutoﬀ for tensile fracture 
OUT Output option for plastic strain in database: 
EQ.0:  Volumetric plastic strain 
EQ.1:  Deviatoric plastic strain 
B Residual strength factor after cracking; see Figure M78-1 . 
FAIL Flag for failure: 
EQ.0:  No failure 
EQ.1:  When pressure reaches failure, pressure element is 
eroded. 
EQ.2:  When pressure reaches failure, pressure element los es its 
ability to carry tension. 
Remarks: 
Pressure is positive in compression.  Volumetric st rain is deﬁned as the natural log of 
the relative volume and is positive in compression where the relative volume, |u1D449, is the 
ratio of the current volume to the initial volume.  The tabulated data should be given in ε1ε2 εp1.0
