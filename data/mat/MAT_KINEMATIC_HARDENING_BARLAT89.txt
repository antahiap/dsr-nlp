V1, V2, V3 Components of vector /u1D42F for AOPT = 3 
D1, D2, D3 Components of vector /u1D41D for AOPT = 2 
BETA Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 0 and 3, may be overridden 
on the element card; see *ELEMENT_SHELL_BETA. 
Remarks: 
1.  Barlat and Lian’s Yield Criterion.  The |u1D44J-values are deﬁned as the ratio of 
instantaneous width change to instantaneous thickne ss change.  That is, as- 
sume that the width /u1D44A and thickness |u1D447 are measured as functions of strain, 
then the corresponding |u1D44J-value is given by: 
|u1D44J =|u1D4J1 /u1D44A 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ //u1D44A
|u1D4J1|u1D447 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ /|u1D447  . 
Input R00, R45 and R90 to deﬁne sheet anisotropy in  the rolling, 45° and 90° 
direction. 
Barlat and Lian’s [1989] anisotropic yield criterio n Φ for plane stress is deﬁned 
as: For shells, define vector 
a, so,
c = n
b = c × a
a = b × c
a: rolling direction R00b: R90c
v × nb
nFor shells, define vector 
v, so,
c = n
a = v × n
b = n × a
