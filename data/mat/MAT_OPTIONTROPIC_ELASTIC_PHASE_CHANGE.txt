 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label n ot exceeding 8 
characters must be speciﬁed. *.   
 tion to work correctly. 
EQ.1.0: locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y a 
point in space and the global location of the eleme nt 
center; this is the /u1D41A-direction.  This option is for solid 
elements only. 
EQ.2.0: globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR. 
EQ.3.0: locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating th e material axes about the element normal by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector /u1D42F with the 
element normal.  The plane of a solid element is th e 
midsurface between the inner surface and outer surface 
deﬁned by the ﬁrst four nodes and the last four nod es 
of the connectivity of the element, respectively. 
EQ.4.0: locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, /u1D40F, which deﬁne the centerline ax- 
is.  This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: the absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VEC TOR).  Available in R3 version of 971 
and later. 
G Shear modulus for frequency independent damping.  F requency 
independent damping is based of a spring and slider  in series.  
The critical stress for the slider mechanism is SIG F deﬁned below.  
For the best results, the value of G should be 250- 1000 times 
greater than SIGF.  This option applies only to sol id elements. 
SIGF Limit stress for frequency independent, fricti onal, damping. 
XP i, YP i, ZP i Deﬁne coordinates of the ith  phase’s point /u1D42∫ for AOPT = 1 and 4. 
A1 i, A2 i, A3 i Deﬁne components of the ith  phase’s vector /u1D41A for AOPT = 2. 
MACF i Material axes change ﬂag for brick elements in pha se i: 
EQ.1: No change, default, 
EQ.2: switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F, *.

The material law that relates stresses to strains i s deﬁned as: 
/u1D402=/u1D41:/ε.st/u1D402|u1D43FCst/u1D41: 
where /u1D41: is a transformation matrix, and /u1D402|u1D43FCst is the constitutive matrix deﬁned in terms of 
the material constants of the orthogonal material a xes, {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C}.  The inverse of  /u1D402|u1D43FCstfor 
the orthotropic case is deﬁned as:

The frequency independent damping is obtained by ha ving a spring and slider in series

This option applies only to orthotropic solid eleme nts and aﬀects only the deviatoric 
stresses. 
 
The procedure for describing the principle material  directions is explained for solid and 
shell elements for this material model and other an isotropic materials.  We will call the 
material direction the {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} coordinate system.  The AOPT options illustrated i n 
Figure M2-1  can deﬁne the {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} system for all elements of the parts that use the 
material, but this is not the ﬁnal material directi on.  There {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} system deﬁned by the 
AOPT options may be oﬀset by a ﬁnal rotation about the /u1D41C-axis.  The oﬀset angle we call 
BETA. 
 
For solid elements, the BETA angle is speciﬁed in o ne of two ways.  When using 
AOPT = 3, the BETA parameter deﬁnes the oﬀset angle  for all elements that use the 
material.  The BETA parameter has no meaning for th e other AOPT options.  G

This discussion of material direction angles in she ll elements also applies to thick shell 
elements which allow modeling of layered composites  using *INTEGRATION_SHELL 
or *PART_COMPOSITE_TSHELL. *
