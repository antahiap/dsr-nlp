 CSIG Plasticity hardening parameter in normal compr ession. 
FAILN Maximum eﬀective separation distance in norma l direction . 
Beyond this distance failure occurs. 
FAILT Maximum eﬀective separation distance in tange ntial direction . 
Beyond this distance failure occurs. 
Remarks: 
In this elastoplastic cohesive material the normal and tangential directions are treated 
separately, but can be connected by expressing the in-plane traction parameters as 
functions of the normal traction.  In the normal di rection the material uses diﬀerent 
models in tension and compression. 
 
Normal tension: 
Assume the total separation is an additive split of  the elastic and plastic separation 
|u1D6FF = |u1D6FF|u1D4J2Cst+ |u1D6FF|u1D4JDCst . 
In normal tension ( |u1D6FF|u1D4J2Cst> 0) the elastic traction is given by 
|u1D447 = |u1D438|u1D6FF|u1D4J2Cst= |u1D438|parenleftCv2|u1D6FF − |u1D6FF|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 ≥ 0, 
where the tensile normal stiﬀness 
|u1D438 = |parenleftCv2|u1D438|u1D441Cst|zeroCst− |u1D438|u1D441Cst|oneCst|parenriµhtCv2 exp

History variables 
This material uses ﬁve history variables.  Eﬀective  separation in the tangential direction 
is saved as Eﬀective Plastic Strain.  History varia ble 1 and 2 indicates the plastic 
separation in each tangential direction.  Eﬀective plastic separation and plastic 
separation in the normal direction are saved as his tory variable 3 and 4, respectively. *
