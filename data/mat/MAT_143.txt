  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
IRATE Rate eﬀects option: 
EQ.0: Rate eﬀects model turned oﬀ (default). 
EQ.1: Rate eﬀects model turned on with the original rate 
dependence described by Murray [2002].  
EQ.2: Rate eﬀects model turned on with Johnson- Cook like rate 
dependence of the strength parameters, as described  
below in Remark 2 . Only works when ITERS < 0 and the 
keyword option is unset (<BLANK>).  
GHARD Perfect plasticity override.  Values greater than o r equal to zero 
are allowed.  Positive values model late time harde ning in 
compression (an increase in strength with increasin g strain).  A 
zero value models perfect plasticity (no increase i n strength wit h 
increasing strain).  The default is zero. 
IFAIL Erosion perpendicular to the grain: 
EQ.0: No (default) 
EQ.1: Yes (not recommended except for debugging) 
IVOL Flag to invoke erosion based on negative volume or strain 
increments greater than 0.01: 
EQ.0: No, do not apply erosion criteria. 
EQ.1: Yes, apply erosion criteria.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector, /u1D42F, with the 
element normal.  The plane of a solid element is th e 
midsurface between the inner surface and outer surf ace 
deﬁned by the ﬁrst four nodes and the last four nod es 
of the connectivity of the element, respectively. 
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector, /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D4JD, which deﬁne the centerline axis.  
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR).   
MACF Material axes change ﬂag: 
EQ.1: No change (default) 
EQ.2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F 
EQ.3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450 
EQ.4: Switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450 
BETA Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 3. It may be overridden on 
the element card; see *ELEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO.

 The strain rate parameters, FLPAR, FLPARC, FLPER, a nd FLPERC, are dimen- 
sionless (factors ≥ 0 that quantify the strain rate dependence).  POWP AR and 
POWPER are quasi-static threshold strain rate value s in the parallel and perpen- 
dicular directions with the units of [time] -1. Variable |u1D7≠≠̅̇ is an eﬀective strain rate. *
