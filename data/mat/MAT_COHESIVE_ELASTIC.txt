This is Material Type 184.  It is a simple cohesive  elastic model for use with cohesive 
element formulations; see the ﬁeld ELFORM in *SECTI ON_SOLID and *SEC-
TION_SHELL.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label n ot exceeding 8 
characters must be speciﬁed. 
RO Mass density 
ROFLG Flag for whether density is speciﬁed per unit  area or volume: 
EQ.0:  speciﬁes the density is per unit volume (default) 
EQ.1:  speciﬁes the density is per unit area for controlli ng the 
mass of cohesive elements with an initial volume of  zero  
INTFAIL The number of integration points required for the c ohesive 
element to be deleted.  If it is zero, the element won’t be deleted 
even if it satisﬁes the failure criterion.  The val ue of INT FAIL may 
range from 1 to 4, with 1 the recommended value. 
ET Stiﬀness in the plane of the cohesive element 
EN Stiﬀness normal to the plane of the cohesive ele ment 
FN_FAIL Traction in the normal direction for tensil e failure 
FT_FAIL Traction in the tangential direction for sh ear failure 
Remarks: 
This material cohesive model outputs three traction s having units of force per unit area 
into the d3plot  database rather than the usual six stress componen ts.  The in-plane shear 
traction along the 1-2 edge replaces the |u1D46J-stress, the orthogonal in plane shear traction 
replaces the |u1D466-stress, and the traction in the normal direction r eplaces the /u1D46̅-stress. *
