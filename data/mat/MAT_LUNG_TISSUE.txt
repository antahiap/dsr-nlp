This is Material Type 129.  This material model pro vides a hyperelastic model for heart 
tissue, see [Vawter 1980] combined optionally with linear viscoelasticity as outlined by 
[Christensen 1980].

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed  (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
K Bulk modulus 
C Material coeﬃcient. 
DELTA ∆, material coeﬃcient. 
ALPHA |u1D6F+, material coeﬃcient. *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
BETA |u1D6FD, material coeﬃcient . 
C1 Material coeﬃcient. 
C2 Material coeﬃcient. 
LCID Optional load curve ID of relaxation curve 
If constants |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst and |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst are determined via a least squares ﬁt.  This 
relaxation curve is shown in Figure M76-1 .  This model ignores 
the constant stress. 
TRAMP Optional ramp time for loading. 
NT Number of Prony series terms in optional ﬁt.  If ze ro, the default 
is 6.  Currently, the maximum number is 6.  Values less than 6, 
possibly 3 - 5 are recommended, since each term used adds 
signiﬁcantly to the cost.  Caution should be exerci sed when takin g 
the results from the ﬁt.  Always check the results of the ﬁt in the 
output ﬁle.  Preferably, all generated coeﬃcients s hould be 
positive.  Negative values may lead to unstable res ults.  Once a 
satisfactory ﬁt has been achieved it is recommended  tha t the 
coeﬃcients which are written into the output ﬁle be  input in 
future runs. 
Gi Optional shear relaxation modulus for the ith  term 
BETA i Optional decay constant if ith  term 
Remarks: 
The material is described by a strain energy functi onal expressed in terms of the 
invariants of the Green Strain: 
/u1D44A(/u1D4:C|oneCst,/u1D4:C|twoCst) =|u1D436
2∆ |u1D4J2(/u1D6FC.st/u1D4:C.st|oneCsts|twoCsts+/u1D6FD.st/u1D4:C.st|twoCsts)+12|u1D436|oneCst
∆(1 + |u1D436|twoCst)/˙racketleft.v2|u1D434(|oneCst+/u1D4:6.st|twoCsts)− 1/˙racketright.v2 
|u1D434|twoCst=4
3(/u1D4:C|oneCst+/u1D4:C|twoCst) − 1 
where the hydrostatic work term is in terms of the bulk modulus, K, and the third 
invariant, J, as: 
/u1D44A|u1D43BCst(/u1D4:D) =|u1D43∆
2(/u1D4:D− 1)|twoCst 
Rate eﬀects are taken into account through linear v iscoelasticity by a convolution 
integral of the form: *
