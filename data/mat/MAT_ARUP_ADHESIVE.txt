This is Material Type 169. This material model was created for adhesive bonding in 
aluminum structures.  The plasticity model is not v olume-conserving, and hence avoids 
the spuriously high tensile stresses that can devel op if adhesive is modeled using 
traditional elasto-plastic material models.  It is available only  for solid elements of 
formulations 1, 2 and 15. The smallest dimension of  the element is assumed to be the 
through-thickness dimension of the bond, unless THK DIR = 1.

Remarks: 
1.  Through-Thickness Direction and Bond Thickness.   The through-thickness 
direction is identiﬁed from the smallest dimension of each element  by default 
(THKDIR = 0.0). It is expected that this dimension will be smaller than in-plane 
dimensions (typically 1 - 2 mm compared with 5 - 10  mm). If this is not the 
case, one can set the through-thickness direction u sing element numbering 
(THKDIR = 1.0).  Then the thickness direction is ex pected to point from lower 
face (nodes 1-2-3-4) to upper face (nodes 5-6-7-8).   For wedge elements these 
faces are the two triangular faces (nodes 1-2-5) an d (nodes 3-4-6). 
The bond thickness is assumed to be the element siz e in the thickness direction.  
This may be overridden using BTHK. In this case the  behavior becomes inde- 
pendent of the element thickness.  The elastic stiﬀ ness is aﬀected by BTHK, so 
it is necessary to set the characteristic element l ength to a smaller value 
/u1D45∫|u1D4J2Cstnew =/radical.v2BT H K ×/u1D45∫|u1D4J2Cstold   . 
This again aﬀects the critical time step of the ele ment, that is, a small BTHK can 
decrease the element time step signiﬁcantly. *.   
 GCTEN ≥/u1D4:F|zeroCst
|u1D438|minuteCst(TENMAX)|twoCst 
Similarly, the minimum value for GCSHR is 
GCS H R ≥/u1D4:F|zeroCst
|u1D43A(S H RMAX)|twoCst 
where |u1D43A is the elastic shear modulus. 
Because of the algorithm used, yielding in tension across the bond does not 
require strains in the plane of the bond – unlike t he plasticity models, plastic 
ﬂow is not treated as volume-conserving. 
4.  Output Variables.   The Plastic Strain output variable has a special meaning: 
0 < PS < 1: PS is the maximum value of the yield fu nction experienced 
since time zero 
1 < PS < 2: the element has yielded and the strengt h is reducing towards 
failure – yields at PS = 1, fails at PS = 2. 
The damage cause by cohesive deformation (0 at ﬁrst  yield to 1 at failure) and 
by interfacial deformation are stored in the ﬁrst t wo extra history variables.  
These can be plotted if NEIPH on *DATABASE_EXTENT_B INARY is 2 or 
more.  By this means, the reasons for failure may b e assessed. 
5.  Rate Effects.   When the plastic strain rate rises above EDOT0, r ate eﬀects are 
assumed to scale with the logarithm of the plastic strain rate, as in the example 
shown in Figure M169-3  for cohesive tensile strength with dynamic factor SD-
FAC. The same form of relationship is applied for t he other dynamic factors.  If 
EDOT0 is zero or blank, no rate eﬀects are applied.   Rate eﬀects are applied 
using the viscoplastic method. 
6.  Interfacial Failure.   Interfacial failure is assumed to arise from stre ss 
concentrations at the edges of the bond – typically  the strength of the bond 
becomes almost independent of bond length.  This ty pe of failure is usually 
more brittle than cohesive failure.  To simulate th is, LS-DYNA identiﬁes the StressTENAMX

bond to the substrate).  Only these elements can fa il initially.  The neighbors of 
failed elements can then develop free edges and fai l in turn. 
In real adhesive bonds, the stresses at the edges c an be concentrated over very 
small areas; in typical ﬁnite element models the el ements are much too large to 
capture this.  Therefore, the concentration of load s onto the edges of the bond 
is accomplished artiﬁcially, by stiﬀening elements containing free edges (e.g. 
FACET, FACES > 1) and reducing the stiﬀness of inte rior elements (e.g. FAC-
CT, FACCS < 1).  Interior elements are allowed to y ield at reduced loads 
(equivalent to TMAXE × FACET/FACCT  and SMAXE × FACES/FACCS ) to 
prevent excessive stresses developing before the ed ge elements have failed - 
but cannot be damaged until they become edge elemen ts after the failure of 
their neighbors. 
7.  Function Arguments.   Parameters TENMAX, GCTEN, SHRMAX, GCSHR, 
SHRP, SDFAC, and SGFAC can be deﬁned as negative va lues.  In that case, the 
absolute values refer to *DEFINE_FUNCTION IDs.  The  arguments of those 
functions include several properties of both connec tion partners if correspond- 
ing solid elements are in a tied contact with shell  elements. 
These functions depend on:

 func(t1,t2,sy1,sy2,sm1,sm2,r,a)=0.5*(sy1+sy2 ) 
Since material parameters must be identiﬁed from bo th bond partners during 
initialization, this feature is only available for a subset of material models at the 
moment, namely material models 24, 36, 120, 123, 12 4, 251, and 258. 
8.  Older Versions.  Some corrections were made to this material model t hat can 
cause results to be diﬀerent in R8 and later versio ns compared to R7.1.3 and 
earlier versions.  To avoid recalibration of old ma terial data, it is possible to 
recover previous results with option FBR713 = 1. Th e corrections were related 
to the post-yield stress-strain response not matchi ng the description in the 
manual, with the diﬀerence being most noticeable wh en (a) the elastic stiﬀness 
was low, such that the elastic displacement to yiel d was of the same order as 
the element thickness; or (b) when the power-law te rms PWRS, PWRT were 
not both equal to 2, and strain rate eﬀects were sp eciﬁed (EDOT2, SDFAC). *
