This is  Material Type 104.  This is a continuum damage mech anics (CDM) model which 
includes anisotropy and viscoplasticity.  The CDM m odel applies to shell, thick shell, 
and brick elements.  A more detailed description of  this model can be found in the 
paper by Berstad, Hopperstad, Lademo, and Malo [199 9].  This material model can also 
model anisotropic damage behavior by setting FLAG t o -1 in Card 2.

2.  Enhanced isotropic damage model (FLAG = 10 or 11).  A more sophisticated 
damage model that includes crack closure eﬀects (re duced damage under 
compression) and more ﬂexibility in stress state de pendence and functional 
expressions is invoked by setting FLAG = 10 or 11.  The corresponding evolu- 
tion equation for the damage variable is deﬁned as 
|u1D437̇= |parenleftCvJ2/u1D̅0F|mCst|aCst|xCst

where /u1D̅0F|mCst|aCst|xCst  is the maximum shear stress, /u1D44C|zeroCst is the initial damage energy re- 
lease rate, and |u1D7≠2, |u1D6F+, and /u1D̅0: are additional material constants. 〈 〉 are the Macauley 
brackets . The damage energy density release rate is

where |u1D7≠∆̃|u1D4J6Cst are the principal eﬀective stresses and ℎ is the microdefects closure 
parameter that accounts for diﬀerent damage behavio r in tension and com- 
pression.  A value of ℎ≈ 0.2  is typically observed in many experiments as stat-
ed in Lemaitre [2000].  A parameter set of ℎ= 1, /u1D44C|zeroCst= 0, |u1D6F+ = 1 , /u1D̅0:= 1, and |u1D7≠2 = 0  
should give the same results as the standard isotro pic damage model 
(FLAG = 0 or 1) with |u1D7≠≠|eCst /f.st/f.st/co⋯⋯a.st/d.st|u1D4JDCst= 0 as long as |u1D7≠∆|oneCst> 0. 
3.  Strain Localization Check (FLAG = 1 or 11).  In order to add strain localiza- 
tion computation to the damage models above, parame ter FLAG should be set 
to 1 (standard damage) or 11 (enhanced damage).  An  acoustic tensor-based 
bifurcation criterion is checked and history variab le no.  4 is set to 1.0 if strain 
localization is indicated.  This is only available for shell elements. 
4.  Anisotropic Damage Model (FLAG = -1).  At each thickness integration 
points, an anisotropic damage law acts on the plane  stress tensor in the direc- 
tions of the principal total shell strains, |u1D7≠≠|oneCst and |u1D7≠≠|twoCst, as follows: 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst = [1 − |u1D437|oneCst(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst)]|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst|zeroCst 
|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst = [1 − |u1D437|twoCst(|u1D7≠≠|twoCst)]|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst|zeroCst

2|<racketriµhtCvJ|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst|zeroCst  
The transverse plate shear stresses in the principa l strain directions are as- 
sumed to be damaged as follows: 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|threeCst = (1 − |u1D437|oneCst/2)|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|threeCst|zeroCst 
|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|threeCst = (1 − |u1D437|twoCst/2)|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|threeCst|zeroCst  *.
