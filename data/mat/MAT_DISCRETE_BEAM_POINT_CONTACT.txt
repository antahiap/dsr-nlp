This is  Material Type 205. It is used for discrete beam ele ments only (ELFORM = 6).  
It simulates contact forces between a point (Node 2 ) and an imaginary ﬂat surface 
(ﬁxed relative to Node 1).  The beam elements may h ave nonzero initial length.  On 
*SECTION_BEAM, SCOOR must be set to -13, the triad rotation option.  The triad 
rotation option ensures that the axis system remain s ﬁxed in the imaginary surface.

Remarks: 
1.  Model Description.  This material model simulates contact between a poi nt 
(Node 2 of the beam element) and an imaginary ﬂat s urface which is ﬁxed 
relative to Node 1. In these remarks we call the im aginary surface the “con- 
tact surface” – this does not  refer to *CONTACT. The local axes are deter- 
mined by CID on *SECTION_BEAM. The imaginary surfac e is in the local 
|u1D46J|u1D466 -plane passing through the initial coordinates of N ode 2. The local /u1D46̅-axis 
points outwards from the surface.  The surface tran slates and rotates with 
Node 1. SCOOR must be set to -13. The elements may have nonzero length. 
When Node 2 moves in the negative local /u1D46̅-direction relative to Node 1 
(penetration into the contact surface), the motion is resisted by stiﬀness 
STIFF and the force generated is described here as the contact force.  By 
default, uplift (Node 2 moving in the positive loca l /u1D46̅-direction relative to 
Node 1) is not resisted.  If uplift greater than DM XPZ occurs, either the el- 
ement is deleted (if LIMPZ = 0) or further uplift i s resisted by STIFF (if 
LIMPZ = 1).  
Sliding on the surface (motion of Node 2 in the loc al |u1D46J- and |u1D466-directions) is 
resisted by friction.  The maximum friction force i s given by FRIC times the 
contact force, with an upper limit of FRMAX if that  parameter is nonzero.  
When one of the displacement limits, DMXPX, DMXNX, DMXPY, or 
DMXNY, is reached, the default behavior is for Node  2 to fall oﬀ the edge of 
the contact surface, and the element is deleted (se e Figure M205-1 ). Option- 
ally, the input ﬁelds LIMPX, LIMNX, LIMPY, and LIMN Y can be used to 
change the behavior to “hard limits” using stiﬀness  STIFF – these represent *.   
 b)  CID can be left blank if the contact surface is al igned in the global /u1D44B/u1D44C -
plane, otherwise a coordinate system should be refe renced. 
c)  SCOOR must be set to -13. 
3.  Output.  Beam “axial” or “ /u1D44B” force is the force in the local |u1D46J-direction.  
“Shear-/u1D44C” or “ /u1D44C” force is the force in the local |u1D466-direction.  “Shear- |u1D44D” or “ |u1D44D” 
force is the force in the local /u1D46̅-direction, normal to the contact surface. 
Other output is written to the d3plot  and d3thdt  ﬁles in the places where 
post-processors expect to ﬁnd the stress and strain  at the ﬁrst integration 
point for integrated beams:
