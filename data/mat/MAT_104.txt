 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
HIS n Choice of variable as driving quantity for damage, called “history 
value” in the following:  
EQ.0: Equivalent plastic strain rate is the driving quant ity for 
the damage if IFLG1 = 0. Alternatively, if IFLG1 = 1, 
components of the plastic strain rate tensor are driving 
quantities for damage (see Remarks 2  and 3). 
GT.0: The rate of the additional history variable HIS n is the 
driving quantity for damage.  IFLG1 should be set t o 0.  
LT.0: *DEFINE_FUNC TION IDs deﬁning the damage driving 
quantities as a function of the components of the p lastic 
strain rate tensor; IFLG1 should be set to 1. 
IFLG1 Damage driving quantities: 
EQ.0: Rates of history variables HIS n 
EQ.1: Speciﬁc components of the plastic strain rate tensor ; see 
Remarks 2  and 3. 
EQ.2: Predeﬁned functions of plastic strain rate component s for 
orthotropic damage model.  HIS n inputs will be ignored, 
and IFLG2 should be set to 1. This option is for sh ell 
elements only. *.

Remarks: 
1.  Standard Isotropic Damage Model (FLAG = 0 or 1).  The Continuum 
Damage Mechanics (CDM) model is based on an approac h proposed by Le- 
maitre [1992].  The eﬀective stress |u1D7≠∆̃, which is the stress calculated over the 
section that eﬀectively resist the forces, reads 
|u1D7≠∆̃=|u1D7≠∆
1 − |u1D437 
where |u1D437 is the damage variable.  The evolution equation fo r the damage varia- 
ble is deﬁned as 
|u1D437̇=
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧0 for |u1D7≠≠|eCst /f.st/f.st|u1D4JDCst≤ |u1D7≠≠|eCst /f.st/f.st/co⋯⋯a.st/d.st|u1D4JDCst

where |u1D7≠≠|eCst /f.st/f.st/co⋯⋯a.st/d.st|u1D4JDCst is the damage threshold, |u1D446 is the so-called damage energy release 
rate, and |u1D7≠∆|oneCst is the maximum principal stress.  The damage energ y density re- 
lease rate is  
/u1D44C=1

2|u1D438(1 − |u1D437)|twoCst 
where |u1D438 is Young’s modulus and |u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst|u1D4JACst  is the equivalent von Mises stress.  The 
triaxiality function |u1D44J|u1D463Cst is deﬁned as  
|u1D44J|u1D463Cst=2

 *.   
 In the anisotropic damage formulation, |u1D437|oneCst(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst) and |u1D437|twoCst(|u1D7≠≠|twoCst) are anisotropic 
damage functions for the loading directions 1 and 2 , respectively.  Stresses 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst|zeroCst , |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst|zeroCst , |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst|zeroCst , |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|threeCst|zeroCst  and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|threeCst|zeroCst  are stresses in the principal shell strain directi ons 
as calculated from the undamaged elastic-plastic ma terial behavior.  The 
strains |u1D7≠≠|oneCst and |u1D7≠≠|twoCst are the magnitude of the principal strains calcula ted upon 
reaching the damage thresholds.  Damage can only de velop for tensile stresses, 
and the damage functions |u1D437|oneCst(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst) and |u1D437|twoCst(|u1D7≠≠|twoCst)are identical to zero for negative 
strains |u1D7≠≠|oneCst and |u1D7≠≠|twoCst. The principal strain directions are ﬁxed within an  integration 
point as soon as either principal strain exceeds th e initial threshold strain in 
tension.  A more detailed description of the damage  evolution for this material 
model is given in the description of Material 81. 
5.  Anisotropic Viscoplasticity. The uniaxial stress-strain curve is given in the 
following form 
|u1D7≠∆|parenleftCv2|u1D4JF, |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D444|oneCst|<racketleftCv11 − exp(−|u1D436|oneCst|u1D4JF)|<racketriµhtCv1 + |u1D444|twoCst|<racketleftCv11 − exp(−|u1D436|twoCst|u1D4JF)|<racketriµhtCv1 + |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst|u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst|u1D449Cst/u1D45A.sts , 
where |u1D4JF is the damage accumulated plastic strain, which ca n be calculated by 
|u1D4JḞ= |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst(1 − |u1D437) . 
For bricks the following yield criterion associated  with the Hill criterion is used 
|u1D439(|u1D7≠∆̃|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D7≠∆̃|threeCst|threeCst )|twoCst+ |u1D43A(|u1D7≠∆̃|threeCst|threeCst − |u1D7≠∆̃|oneCst|oneCst )|twoCst+/u1D4:B(|u1D7≠∆̃|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D7≠∆̃|twoCst|twoCst )|twoCst

where |u1D4JF is the damage eﬀective viscoplastic strain and |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective visco- 
plastic strain rate.  For shells the anisotropic be havior is given by the R-values: 
|u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst , |u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst , and |u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst .  When |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst= 0, the material will behave as an elastoplastic 
material without rate eﬀects.  Default values for t he anisotropic constants are 
given by: 
|u1D439 = |u1D43A =/u1D4:B=1
2
/u1D4:F= |u1D44≠ =/u1D441=3
2
|u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst = |u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst = |u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst = 1 
so that isotropic behavior is obtained. 
Strain rate is accounted for using the Cowper and S ymonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor: 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
 
To convert these constants, set the viscoelastic co nstants, |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst and |u1D449|u1D4JACst, to the 
following values: *
