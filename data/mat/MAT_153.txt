Model Description: 
This model is based on the work of Lemaitre [1992],  and Dufailly and Lemaitre [1995].  
It is a pressure-independent plasticity model with the yield surface deﬁned by the 
function 
|u1D439 = |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt− |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= 0  , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst is uniaxial yield stress, 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCst+/u1D4:B
|u1D6FD|<racketleftCv11 − exp|parenleftCv1−|u1D6FD|u1D4JF|parenriµhtCv1|<racketriµhtCv1  . 
By setting |u1D6FD = 0 , a linear isotropic hardening is obtained 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCst+/u1D4:B |u1D4JF  , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCst is the initial yield stress.  In the above, |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt is the equivalent von Mises stress, 
with respect to the deviatoric eﬀective stress, 
s|eCst= de v [σ/tilℂecomb.h1] −α=s−α   .  
Here /u1D42C is deviatoric stress and /u1D6C2 is the back stress, which is the sum of up to four  terms 
according to: 
α=|summationCv1α/∗.st
/∗.st  . 
σ/tilℂecomb.h1 is eﬀective stress (undamaged stress), based on Co ntinuum Damage Mechanics 
model [Lemaitre 1992], 
σ/tilℂecomb.h1=σ
1 − |u1D437  . 
Here |u1D437 is the isotropic damage scalar, which is bounded b y 0 and 1 
0 ≤ |u1D437 ≤ 1  . 
|u1D437 = 0  represents a damage-free material RVE (representat ive volume element), while 
|u1D437 = 1  represents a fully broken material RVE in two part s.  In fact, fracture occurs when 
|u1D437 = |u1D437|u1D4J≠Cst< 1, modeled as element removal.  The evolution of the  isotropic damage value 
related to ductile damage and fracture (the case wh ere the plastic strain or dissipation is 
much larger than the elastic one, [Lemaitre 1992]) is deﬁned as

 Uniaxial cyclic tension and compression: 
This material can be used to model cyclic hardening  plasticity, including eﬀects known 
as plastic shakedown  and strain racheting . To understand how the plasticity parameters 
qualitatively inﬂuence the behavior in uniaxial ten sion and compression, we restrict 
ourselves to a discussion concerning linear isotrop ic hardening with initial yield |u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st and 
hardening modulus /u1D4:B. We also only include two kinematic hardening term s.  For the 
kinematic part, we use one linear term with hardeni ng |u1D436|zeroCst (and decay coeﬃcient |u1D6F∆|zeroCst= 0)  
and one combined term with hardening |u1D436 and decay coeﬃcient |u1D6F∆. The elastic Young’s 
modulus is denoted |u1D438, and we neglect any forms of temperature or rate e ﬀects. 
 
While this is merely an attempt to explain the phen omena, estimating the parameters 
that reﬂect the actual behavior of the physical mat erial may be diﬃcult.  Because of this, 
we recommend the ﬁtting options provided by KHFLG, where even the eﬀects of 
temperature can be accounted for. 
 
Strain induced deformation 
 
Consider the cyclic deformation depicted in Figure M153-1  in which the uniaxial strain 
ranges between |u1D7≠≠ and |u1D7≠≠̅. Two subsequent stress-strain cycles are shown.  
 
If the isotropic hardening modulus  /u1D4:B= 0, then the cycles are identical.  For nonzero 
hardening /u1D4:B, the stress level increases with each cycle and th e strain width indicated by 
|u1D7≠≠⃡ decreases.  As the yield surface expands, the isot ropic hardening eﬀect diminishes, 
and we tend towards a stable cycle; this phenomenon  is called plastic shakedown . 
 
If both /u1D4:B and |u1D436|zeroCst are zero, then the end of each cycle tends towards  ideal plastic since 
the presence of a nonzero |u1D6F∆ saturates the level of back stress and consequentl y the stress 
|u1D7≠∆ itself.  This physical phenomenon is unlikely.  Th erefore, we recommend having at 
least one linear kinematic hardening term present i n combination with some isotropic 
hardening for a realistic behavior. 
 
Stress induced deformation 
 
For stress induced deformation, we impose a cyclic stress between |u1D7≠∆ and |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt as shown in 
Figure M153-2  and investigate two subsequent stress-strain cycle s.  In this case a 
combination of isotropic hardening and nonlinear ki nematic hardening may cause a 
drift in strain.  This drift is referred to as ratcheting strain  and may be considered a creep 
phenomenon.  Even without the isotropic hardening /u1D4:B, a nonzero mean stress, 
(|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt+ |u1D7≠∆)/2, in the cycle causes a ratcheting eﬀect.  We again  recommend using 
combinations of isotropic, linear and nonlinear kin ematic hardening for accurate 
predictions of this creep behavior.
