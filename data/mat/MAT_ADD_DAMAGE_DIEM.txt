Remarks: 
1.  DEPS.   In DIEM, you may invoke up to 5 damage initiation  and evolution 
criteria.  For the sake of eﬃciency, the parameter DEPS can be used to only 
check these criteria in quantiﬁed increments of pla stic strain.  In other words, 
the criteria are only checked when the eﬀective pla stic strain goes beyond 
DEPS , 2 × DEPS , 3 × DEPS , etc.  For DEPS = 0 the checks are performed in ea ch 
step there is plastic ﬂow.  A reasonable value of D EPS could, for instance, be 
DEPS = 0.0001. *MAT  *.   *MAT  
LS-DYNA R13 2-53 (MAT) The damage variable relates the macroscopic (damage d) to microscopic (true) 
stress by 
|u1D7≠∆ = (1 − |u1D437)|u1D7≠∆̃  . 
Once the damage has reached the level of |u1D437|eCst /r.st/o.st/d.st |eCst  (=0.99 by default) the stress is 
set to zero and the integration point is assumed fa iled and not processed there- 
after.  For NUMFIP > 0, a shell element is eroded a nd removed from the ﬁnite 
element model when NUMFIP integration points have f ailed.  For NUM-
FIP < 0, a shell element is eroded and removed from  the ﬁnite element model 
when -NUMFIP percent of the layers have failed. 
Damage Initiation, /u1D̅4E/u1D46B: 
For each evolution type  |u1D4J6, |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4J6Cst governs the onset of damage.  For |u1D4J6 ≠/u1D45̅, the evolution of 
|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4J6Cst is independent from the evolution of  |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4J7Cst.  The following list enumerates the 
algorithms for modelling damage initiation. 
 
In this subsection we suppress the superscripted |u1D4J6 indexing the evolution type. 
1.  Ductility Based on Stress Triaxiality (DITYP = 0).  For the ductile initiation 
option, a function |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D7≠2, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst) represents the plastic strain at onset of dam- 
age (P1).  This is a function of stress triaxiality  deﬁned as 
|u1D7≠2 = −|u1D4JD
/u1D45E  , 
with |u1D4JD being the pressure and /u1D45E the von Mises equivalent stress.  Optionally 
this can be deﬁned as a table with the second depen dency being on the eﬀec- 
tive plastic strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, where a negative sign of the ﬁrst strain rate in the 
table means that it is in logarithmic scale. The da mage initiation history varia- 
ble evolves according to 
|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st=/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠Cst|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst  . 
2.  Shear (DITYP = 1).  For the shear initiation option, a function |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst(/u1D̅0:, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst) 
represents the plastic strain at onset of damage (P 1).  This is a function of a 
shear stress function deﬁned as 
/u1D̅0:=/u1D45E+/u1D458/u1D446.st|u1D4JD
/u1D̅0F  . 
Here |u1D4JD is the pressure, /u1D45E is the von Mises equivalent stress and /u1D̅0F is the maxi- 
mum shear stress deﬁned as a function of the princi pal stress values: 
/u1D̅0F=|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst /∗.st/o.st/r.st− |u1D7≠∆|mCst|iCst|nCst /o.st/r.st|parenriµhtCv2
2  . *MAT  *.   *MAT  
LS-DYNA R13 2-55 (MAT) |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st=/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠Cst|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst  . 
For this initiation option with shells, P2 is used to determine the layer in the 
shell where the criterion is evaluated.  If P2 = 0,  the criterion is evaluated in the 
mid-layer only, whereas if P2 = 1, it is evaluated in the outer layers only (bot- 
tom and top).  This can be used to distinguish betw een a membrane instability 
typically used for FLD evaluations (P2 = 0) and a b ending instability (P2 = 1).  
For shells, as soon as |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st reaches 1 in any of the integration points of inte rest, 
all  integration points in the shell goes over in damag e mode, meaning subse- 
quent damage is applied to the entire element.  For  solids/tshells, only P2 = 0 
is currently supported, and when |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st reaches 1 in the center of the section then 
all elements in the section goes into damage mode.  Again, more details for 
solids or thick shells are provided in the section titled MSFLD and FLD with 
solid and thick shell elements . 
4.  FLD (DITYP = 3).  The FLD initiation criterion is identical to MSFLD  with one 
subtle diﬀerence: the plastic strain used to evalua te the criteria does not ac- 
count for the sign of the hydrostatic stress but is  instead identical to the eﬀec- 
tive plastic strain directly from the underlying ma terial model.  In other words, 
it is not the modiﬁed plastic strain used in the MS FLD criterion, but apart from 
that it is an identical criterion. 
5.  Ductile based on normalized principal stress (DITYP  = 4).  For the ductile 
initiation option the plastic strain at the onset o f damage (P1) is taken as a func- 
tion of |u1D6FD and |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, that is |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D6FD, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst). Here |u1D6FD is the normalized principal stress 
|u1D6FD =/u1D45E+/u1D458/u1D451.st|u1D4JD
|u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst /∗.st/o.st/r.st   , 
where |u1D4JD is the pressure, /u1D45E is the von Mises equivalent stress, |u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst /∗.st/o.st/r.st is the major 
principal stress, and /u1D458/u1D451.st is the pressure inﬂuence parameter speciﬁed in the  P2 
ﬁeld.  Optionally, this can be deﬁned as a table wi th the second dependency 
being on the eﬀective plastic strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, where a negative sign of the ﬁrst 
strain rate in the table means that it is in logari thmic scale. The damage initia- 
tion history variable evolves according to 
|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st=/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠Cst|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst  . 
 
MSFLD and FLD with solid and thick shell elements 
 
When using MSFLD or FLD with solid or thick shell e lements, the following restrictions 
apply: *MAT  *.   *MAT  
LS-DYNA R13 2-57 (MAT) |u1D462̇|u1D4JDCst= |<raceleftCvJ0 |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st< 1
/u1D45∫|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st≥ 1 
Here /u1D45∫ is a characteristic length of the element.  Fractu re energy is related to plastic 
displacement as follows 
|u1D43A/u1D45:.st=/integral.v:|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D4J1|u1D462|u1D4JDCst|u1D462Cst/u1D45:.sts|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst  , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst is the yield stress.  The following list enumerate s the algorithms available for 
modelling damage. 
1.  Linear (DETYP = 0).  With this option, if |u1D6F+ = 0  (Q3) and Q1 is positive, the 
damage variable evolves linearly with the plastic d isplacement after onset of 
damage: 
|u1D437̇=|u1D462̇|u1D4JDCst
|u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst  .  
Here |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst is the plastic displacement at failure (Q1).  
If Q1 is negative, then –Q1 refers to a table that deﬁnes |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst as a function of triax- 
iality and damage, that is, |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst= |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D7≠2, |u1D437) . In this case with |u1D6F+ = 0 , the damage 
evolution law generalizes to:  
|u1D437̇=|u1D462̇|u1D4JDCst
∂|u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst
∂|u1D437 . 
For a ﬁxed triaxiality, |u1D7≠2, |u1D462̅/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst:= |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D7≠2, 1)  deﬁnes the plastic displacement at fail- 
ure, and the shape of |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D7≠2, |u1D437)  as a function of |u1D437 determines the post-instability 
characteristics.  
A linear curve, as illustrated by the solid line in  Figure 2-2 , corresponds exactly 
to a constant plastic displacement to failure equal  to |u1D462̅/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst and can be seen as a 
reference curve for this discussion.  For simplicit y assume uniaxial tension ( |u1D7≠2 =
1/3). A curve with positive curvature, represented by the dash-dots in Fig- 
ure 2-2 , means that damage evolves quickly right after ons et of instability and 
more slowly when approaching failure.  In contrast,  damage evolves slowly 
early and more quickly later on for a curve with ne gative curvature, represent- 
ed by the dashes.  The qualitative eﬀect these curv es have in a uniaxial tension 
test is also illustrated.  The correlation between a damage curve and the actual 
behavior in tests is not straightforward, thus thes e curves need to be estab- 
lished on a trial-and-error basis. 
For |u1D6F+ > 0  and |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst> 0, the damage evolution follows an exponential law g iven 
by *MAT  *.   *MAT

where |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst= 2|u1D43A/u1D45:.st/|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCsts and |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCsts is the yield stress when failure criterion is reac hed. *MAT  *
