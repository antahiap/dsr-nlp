implicit incompressible SPH formulation (FORM = 13 in *CONTROL_SPH) and should 
be assigned to structures sampled with the *DEFINE_ SPH_MESH_SURFACE keyword.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density.  This should be set to the rest densi ty of the ﬂuid.  
The actual mass of the structure will be calculated  from the parent 
surfaces sampled with the *DEFINE_SPH_MESH_SUR FACE 
keyword. 
BETA Numerical surface adhesion coeﬃcient.  For wat er, a value of |u1D6FD=
1000  m/s|twoCst is recommended. 
ROUGH Surface roughness coeﬃcient.  A friction force betw een the 
structure and the ﬂuid is generated based on the vi scosit y of the 
ﬂuid scaled by this coeﬃcient.  A value between 1 a nd 10 is 
usually recommended.  
Remarks: 
The surface adhesion coeﬃcient is purely numerical and is based on a normalized 
version of the algorithm presented in [ 1].
