This is  Material Type 261 which is an orthotropic continuum  damage model for 
laminated ﬁber-reinforced composites.  See Pinho, I annucci and Robinson [2006].  It is 
based on a physical model for each failure mode and  considers non-linear in-plane 
shear behavior. 
This model is implemented for shell, thick shell an d solid elements. 
Note: Laminated shell theory can be applied by sett ing LAMSHT ≥ 3 in *CONTROL_-

Load Curve.   When LCSS is a load curve ID, it deﬁnes the non-
linear in-plane shear-stress as a function of in-pl ane shear- strain 
(|u1D6F∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst ). 
Tabular Data.   The table maps in-plane strain rate values ( |u1D6F∆̇|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst ) to 
a load curve giving the in-plane shear-stress as a function of in-
plane shear- strain.  For strain rates below the minimum value, the 
curve for the lowest deﬁned value of strain rate is  used.  Likewise, 
when the strain rate ex ceeds the maximum value, the curve for 
the highest deﬁned value of strain rate is used.

logarithmic interpolation between discrete strain r ates is *.

 3.  Nonlinear In-Plane Shear.   To account for the characteristic nonlinear in-
plane shear behavior of laminated ﬁber-reinforced c omposites, a 1D elasto-
plastic formulation is coupled to a linear damage b ehavior once the maximum 
allowable stress state for shear failure is reached .  The non-linearity of the 
shear behavior can be introduced using the deﬁnitio n of an explicit shear stress 
as a function of engineering shear strain curve (LC SS) with *DEFINE_CURVE.  
See Figure M261-3  (in which /u1D̅16|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst  designates engineering shear strain rather than 
tensorial shear strain). 
4.  Element Deletion.   When failure has occurred in all the composite la yers 
(through-thickness integration points), the element  is deleted.  Elements that 
share nodes with the deleted element become “crashf ront” elements and can 
have their strengths reduced by using the SOFT para meter.  An earlier initia- 
tion of crashfront elements is possible by using th e parameter PFL. 
5.  History Variables.   The number of additional integration point variab les 
written to the LS-DYNA database is input by the *DA TABASE_EXTENT_BI-
NARY deﬁnition with the variable NEIPS (shells) and  NEIPH (solids).  These 
additional variables are tabulated below ( i = integration point).    
When intending to initialize the stress state using  *INTIAL_STRESS_ OPTION , 
the stress values SIGXX, SIGYY, etc.  in *INITIAL_S TRESS_ OPTION  are not 
used, rather stresses are determined from the total  strain history variables 31 to 
36.
