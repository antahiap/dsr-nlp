EQ.0.0: Default set to “1.0” 
EQ.1.0: Tensile pressure is limited by PC, that is, |u1D4JD is always ≥ 
PC.  
EQ.2.0: If |u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst|xCst ≥ −PC  element spalls and tension, |u1D4JD < 0 , is 
never allowed.

allowed.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
EPS i Eﬀective plastic strain (true).  Deﬁne up to 16 val ues.  Care must 
be taken that the full range of strains expected in  the analysis is 
covered.  Linear extrapolation is used if the strai n values exceed 
the maximum input value.  See Remark 2 .

2-172 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 diﬀerent materials.  The spall model options permit  incorporation of material 
failure, fracture, and disintegration eﬀects under tensile loads. 
The STOCHASTIC option allows spatially varying yiel d and failure behavior.  
See *DEFINE_STOCHASTIC_VARIATION for additional inf ormation. 
2.  Yield Stress and Plastic Hardening Modulus.   If ES and EPS values are 
undeﬁned, the yield stress and plastic hardening mo dulus are taken from SIG0 
and EH.  In this case, the bilinear stress-strain c urve shown in M10-1  is ob- 
tained with hardening parameter, |u1D6FD = 1 .  The yield strength is calculated as 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D438/uni210E.st|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst+ |parenleftCv1|u1D44∆|oneCst+ |u1D4JD|u1D44∆|twoCst|parenriµhtCv1max|<racketleftCv1|u1D4JD, 0|<racketriµhtCv1  . 
The quantity |u1D438/uni210E.st is the plastic hardening modulus deﬁned in terms o f Young’s 
modulus, |u1D438, and the tangent modulus, |u1D438|u1D461Cst, as follows 
|u1D438/uni210E.st=|u1D438|u1D461Cst|u1D438
|u1D438 − |u1D438|u1D461Cst. 
The pressure, |u1D4JD, is taken as positive in compression. 
If ES and EPS are speciﬁed, a curve like that shown  in Figure M10-1  may be 
deﬁned.  Eﬀective stress is deﬁned in terms of the deviatoric stress tensor, |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , 
as: 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt= |parenleftCvJ3
2|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2
 
and eﬀective plastic strain by: 
|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst=/integral.v:|parenleftCvJ2
3|u1D437|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JDCst|u1D437|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2
|u1D4J1|u1D461 |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst  , 
where |u1D461 denotes time and |u1D437|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JDCst is the plastic component of the rate of defor- 
mation tensor.  In this case the plastic hardening modulus on Card 1 is ignored 
and the yield stress is given as 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1  , 
where the value for |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1 is found by interpolating the data curve. 
3.  Spall Models.  A choice of three spall models is oﬀered to represe nt material 
splitting, cracking, and failure under tensile load s.   
a)  The pressure limit model, SPALL = 1, limits the hy drostatic tension to the 
speciﬁed value, |u1D4JDcut .  If pressures more tensile than this limit are ca lculat- 
ed, the pressure is reset to |u1D4JDcut .  This option is not strictly a spall model, 
since the deviatoric stresses are unaﬀected by the pressure reaching the 
tensile cutoﬀ, and the pressure cutoﬀ value, |u1D4JDcut , remains unchanged 
throughout the analysis. *
