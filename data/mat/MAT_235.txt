where |u1D438|oneCst, |u1D438|twoCst,/u1D̅08|oneCst|twoCst ,/u1D̅08|twoCst|threeCst , |u1D43A|oneCst|twoCst   and  |u1D43A|twoCst|threeCst  are Young’s moduli, Poisson’s ratios, and the 
shear moduli of the yarn material, respectively. |u1D7≠7  is a discount factor, which is function 
of the braid angle, /u1D̅0:, and has value between |u1D7≠7|zeroCst and 1 as shown in the next ﬁgure.  
Initially, in a free stress state, the discount fac tor is a small value (DSCF = |u1D7≠7|zeroCst≪ 1) and 
the material has very small resistance to shear def ormation if any.
