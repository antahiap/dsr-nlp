LS-PrePost always blindly labels this component as eﬀe ctive

iteration.

as a function of grade.

reduction factors are 0.80 in tension/shear and 0.9 3 in 
compression. 
EQ.-2.0: Clear wood.  No strength reduction factors are 
applied, that is, the reduction factors are 1.0 in ten- 
sion, shear, and compression. 
GT.0.0: User deﬁned quality factor in tension/shear.  Value s 
between 0 and 1 are expected.  Values greater than 
one are allowed but may not be realistic. 
QUAL_C User deﬁned quality factor in compression (s ee Remark 1 ).  This 
input value is used if QUAL_T > 0.  Values between 0 and 1 are 
expected.  Values greater than one are allowed but may not be 
realistic.  If left blank, a default value of QUAL_ C = QUAL_ T is 
used.

Remarks: 
1.  Quality Factors.   Material property data is for clear wood (small s amples 
without defects like knots), whereas real structure s are composed of graded 
wood.  Clear wood is stronger than graded wood.  Qu ality factors (strength 
reduction factors) are applied to the clear wood st rengths to account for reduc- 
tions in strength as a function of grade.  One qual ity factor (QUAL_T) is ap- 
plied to the tensile and shear strengths.  A second  quality factor (QUAL_C) is 
applied to the compressive strengths.  As an option , predeﬁned quality factors 
are provided based on correlations between LS-DYNA calculations and test 
data for pine and ﬁr posts impacted by bogie vehicl es.  By default, quality fac- 
tors are applied to both the parallel and perpendic ular to the grain strengths.  
An option is available (IQUAL) to eliminate applica tion perpendicular to the 
grain. 
2.  Johnson-Cook Like Logarithmic Rate Dependence.  A Johnson-Cook like 
logarithmic rate dependence can be invoked by IRATE  = 2 when the keyword 
option is unset and ITERS < 0. In that case, the st rength parameters are:
