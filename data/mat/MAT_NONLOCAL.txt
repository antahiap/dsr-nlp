 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
IDNL Nonlocal material input ID 
PID Part ID for nonlocal material 
P Exponent of weighting function.  A typical value mi ght be 8 
depending somewhat on the choice of L.  See Remark 4 . 
Q Exponent of weighting function.  A typical value mi ght be 2.  
See Remark 4 . 
L Characteristic length.  This length should span a f ew elements.  
See Remark 4 . 
NFREQ Number of time steps between searching for integrat ion points 
that lie in the neighborhood.  Nonlocal smoothing w ill be done 
each cycle using these neighbors until the next sea rch is done.  
The neighbor search can add signiﬁcant computationa l time, so 
it is suggested that NFREQ be set to a value betwee n 10 and 100 
depending on the problem.  This parameter may be so mewhat 
problem dependent.  If NFREQ  =  0, a single search will be 
done at the start of the calculation. 
NHV N umber of variables with nonlocal treatment of incre ments.  See 
Remark 1  
NHVT Number of variables with nonlocal treatment of total values.  
See Remark 1 . 
NL1, …, NL8 Identiﬁes the history variable(s) for nonlocal trea tment.  Deﬁne 
NHV + NHVT values (maximum of 8 values per line).  See 
Remark 2 . *.   
2-130 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 in the third column in the table below corresponds to the history variable 
number as tabulated at http://www.dynasupport.com/howtos/material-
/history-variables .  Note that the NL n value is the history variable number 
plus 1.
