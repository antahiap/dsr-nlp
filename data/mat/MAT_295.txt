  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
point, |u1D443, in space and the global location of the element 
center; this is the /u1D41A-direction.  This option is for solid 
elements only. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with ma terial axes determined by 
vectors /u1D41A and /u1D41D input below, as with *DEFINE_COOR-
DINATE_VECTOR 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by a 
vector /u1D42F and the normal vector to the plane of the ele- 
ment.  The plane of a solid element is the mi dsurface 
between the inner surface and outer surface deﬁned by 
the ﬁrst four nodes and the last four nodes of the con- 
nectivity of the element, respectively.  Thus, for solid 
elements, AOPT = 3 is only available for hexahedrons. 
/u1D41A is determined by taking the cross product of /u1D42F with 
the normal vector, /u1D41B is determined by taking the cross 
product of the normal vector with /u1D41A, and /u1D41C is the nor- 
mal vector.  Then /u1D41A and /u1D41B are rotated about /u1D41C by an an- 
gle BETA. BE TA may be set in the keyword input for 
the element or in the input for this keyword.  Note  that 
for solids, the material axes may be switched depen d- 
ing on the choice of MACF. The switch may occur be-
fore or after applying BETA depending on MACF.  
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotropic in a cylindrical coordinate syst em 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D443, which deﬁne the centerline ax- 
is.  This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: |AOPT|  is a coordinate system ID (see *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_ OPTION ).

5.  General Structure Tensor.  Considering the anisotropic part of the strain 
energy function, one may distinguish angular integr ation (AI) and general 
structure tensor (GST) based models.  Owing to thei r numerical eﬃcacy, cur- 
rently all models in LS-DYNA rely on the general st ructure tensor [7] , [8] . Pa- 
rameters deﬁning the structure tensor and ﬁber mode ls need to be provided 
for each ﬁber family.  Consequently, one may use di ﬀerent structure tensors 
and/or ﬁber models to describe the behavior of the individual ﬁber families. 
The model proposed by Freed et al. [3]  is a special case of the general structure 
tensor-based models assuming rotational symmetric ﬁ ber dispersion, deter- 
mining the parameters A and B using a normal distri bution, and invoking the 
ﬁber model introduced by Freed and Doehring [2] . 
6.  Fiber Families.  Characteristic material directions within the plan e are deﬁned 
by ﬁber families.  The number of ﬁber families for INTYPE = 0 is currently 
limited to 3. If INTYPE = 1, the number of ﬁber fam ilies is limited to 2 that 
represent the ﬁber and sheet directions, respective ly.  The ﬁber and sheet direc- 
tions form an orthonormal basis. 
7.  Coupling (Quasi-)Invariants.  To further enhance the material model, coupling 
(quasi-) invariants associated with pairs of direct ions may be included in the 
strain-energy function.  Following the formulation in Holzapfel and Ogden [7]  
and Eriksson et al. [1] , a single coupling invariant deﬁned between the or - 
thonormal ﬁber and sheet directions is included wit h INTYPE = 1. 
8.  Onset of Active Stress. The input for this model gives you several diﬀerent  
methods for triggering the activation and deactivat ion of the active stress de- 
velopment.  
a)  For ACTYPE = 1, 2, 3, and 4, T0 speciﬁes the time at which active stress 
development is activated.  This method does not inc lude deactivation.  
The other methods take priority over setting T0. 
b)  For all ACTYPE options, you can specify ACID and A CTHR. ACID repre- 
sents the evolution of either the calcium ion conce ntration (ACTYPE = 1, 
2, 3, or 5) or the transmembrane potential (ACTYPE = 4) over time.  AC-
THR is a threshold value for one of these quantitie s depending on AC-
TYPE. When the calcium ion concentration or transme mbrane potential 
from the curve exceeds the threshold, the active st ress development is ac- 
tivated.  When it is less than the threshold, the a ctive stress development 
is deactivated.  With this method, the active stres s development can be re- 
activated again when the value in the curve exceeds  the threshold. *.
