LOG_LOG_INTERPOLATION 
This is Material Type 183. This material model prov ides an incompressible rubber 
model deﬁned by a single uniaxial load curve for lo ading (or a table if rate eﬀects are 
considered) and a single uniaxial load curve for un loading.  This model is similar to 
*.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
K Linear bulk modulus. 
MU Damping coeﬃcient. 
G Shear modulus for frequency independent damping.  F requency 
independent damping is based of a spring and slider  in series.  
The critical stress for the slider mechanism is SIG F deﬁned below.  
For the best results, the value of G should be 250- 1000 times 
greater than SIGF. 
SIGF Limit stress for frequency independent, fricti onal, damping. 
SGL Specimen gauge length 
SW Specimen width 
ST Specimen thickness 
LC/TBID Load curve ID or table ID, see *DEFINE_TA BLE, deﬁning the 
force versus actual change in t he gauge length.  If SGL, SW, and 
ST are set to unity (1.0), then curve LC is also en gineering stress 
versus engineering strain.  If the table deﬁnition is used, a family 
of curves is deﬁned for discrete strain rates.  The curves should 
cover the complet e range of expected response, including both 
compressive (negative values) and tensile (positive  values) 
regimes. 
TENSION Parameter that controls how the rate eﬀects are tre ated.  
Applicable to the table deﬁnition. 
EQ.-1.0:  rate eﬀects are considered during tension and 
compression loading, but not during unloading, 
EQ.0.0:  rate eﬀects are considered for compressive loading 
only, 
EQ.1.0:  rate eﬀects are treated identically in tension and 
compression. 
RTYPE Strain rate type if a table is deﬁned: 
EQ.0.0:  true strain rate, 
EQ.1.0:  engineering strain rate *.
