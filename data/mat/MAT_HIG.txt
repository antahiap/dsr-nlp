PLOSIVE_BURN in which the variable BETA is set to 0  or 2, the absolute value 
of the history variable labeled as “eﬀective plasti c strain” is the explosive light- 
ing time.  This lighting time takes into account sh adowing if invoked (see 
*CONTROL_EXPLOSIVE_SHADOW).   
There are four additional history variables for the  JWL equation of state.  Those 
history variables are internal energy, bulk viscosi ty in units of pressure, vol- 
ume, and burn fraction, respectively.  To output th e history variables, set the 
variable NEIPH in *DATABASE_EXTENT_BINARY.  
The AFTERBURN option introduces an additional 5 th  history variable that rec- 
ords the added afterburn energy |u1D444 for simple afterburn (OPT = 1 or 2) but 
contains the growth term |u1D7≠6 when using the Miller’s extension model (OPT = 3).*EOS  *EOS_SACK_TUESDAY

Remarks: 
Equation of State Form 7 is used to calculate the s hock initiation (or failure to initiate) 
and detonation wave propagation of solid high explo sives.  It should be used instead of 
the ideal HE burn options whenever there is a quest ion whether the HE will react, there 
is a ﬁnite time required for a shock wave to build up to detonation, and/or there is a 
ﬁnite thickness of the chemical reaction zone in a detonation wave.  At relatively low 
initial pressures (<2-3 GPa), this equation of stat e should be used with material type 10 
for accurate calculations of the unreacted HE behav ior.  At higher initial pressures, 
material type 9 can be used.  A JWL equation of sta te deﬁnes the pressure in the 
unreacted explosive as 
|u1D443|u1D4J2Cst= |u1D4JF|oneCst|u1D4J2−|u1D4JFCst|fiveCsts|u1D449Cst|u1D4J2Csts+ |u1D4JF|twoCst|u1D4J2−|u1D4JFCst|sixCsts|u1D449Cst|u1D4J2Csts+ |u1D4JF|threeCst|u1D447|u1D4J2Cst
|u1D449|u1D4J2Cst, |parenleftCv2|u1D4JF|threeCst= |u1D714|u1D4J2CstC|vCst|rCsts|parenriµhtCv2 
where |u1D449|u1D4J2Cst and |u1D447|u1D4J2Cst are the relative volume and temperature, respectiv ely, of the unreacted 
explosive.  Another JWL equation of state deﬁnes th e pressure in the reaction products 
as 
|u1D443|u1D4JDCst= |u1D44∆|u1D4J2−|u1D46JCst|u1D4JDCst |oneCsts|u1D449Cst|u1D4JDCsts+ |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D46JCst|u1D4JDCst |twoCsts|u1D449Cst|u1D4JDCsts+|u1D4J4|u1D447|u1D4JDCst
|u1D449|u1D4JDCst, |parenleftCv3|u1D4J4 = |u1D714|u1D4JDCstC|vCst|pCsts|parenriµhtCv3 
where |u1D449|u1D4JDCst and |u1D447|u1D4JDCst are the relative volume and temperature, respectiv ely, of the reaction 
products.  As the chemical reaction converts unreac ted explosive to reaction products, 
these JWL equations of state are used to calculate the mixture of unreacted explosive 
and reaction products deﬁned by the fraction reacte d |u1D439 (|u1D439 = 0  implies no reaction, |u1D439 = 1  
implies complete reaction).  The temperatures and p ressures are assumed to be equal 
(|u1D447|u1D4J2Cst= |u1D447|u1D4JDCst, |u1D4JD|u1D4J2Cst= |u1D4JD|u1D4JDCst) and the relative volumes are additive, that is, 
|u1D449 = (1 − |u1D439)|u1D449|u1D4J2Cst+ |u1D439|u1D449|u1D4JDCst 
The chemical reaction rate for conversion of unreac ted explosive to reaction products 
consists of three physically realistic terms:  an i gnition term in which a small amount of 
explosive reacts soon after the shock wave compress es it; a slow growth of reaction as 
this initial reaction spreads; and a rapid completi on of reaction at high pressure and 
temperature.  The form of the reaction rate equatio n is

Details of the computational methods and many examp les of one and two dimensional 
shock initiation and detonation wave calculation ca n be found in the references 
(Cochran and Chan [1979], Lee and Tarver [1980]).  Unfortunately, suﬃcient 
experimental data has been obtained for only two so lid explosives to develop very 
reliable shock initiation models:  PBX-9504 (and th e related HMX-based explosives LX-
14,LX-10,LX-04, etc.) and LX-17 (the insensitive TA TB-based explosive).  Reactive ﬂow 
models have been developed for other explosives (TN T, PETN, Composition B, 
propellants, etc.) but are based on very limited ex perimental data.

Remarks: 
Burn fractions, |u1D439, which multiply the equations of states for high e xplosives, control the 
release of chemical energy for simulating detonatio ns.  At any time, the pressure in a 
high explosive element is given by: 
|u1D4JD = |u1D439|u1D4JDeos (|u1D449, |u1D438) , 
where |u1D4JDeos  is the pressure from the equation of state (either  types 2, 3, or 14), |u1D449 is the 
relative volume, and |u1D438 is the internal energy density per unit initial vo lume. 
 *. H_EXPLOSIVE_BURN  
2-164 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 In the initialization phase, a lighting time, |u1D461|u1D4J9Cst, is computed for each element by dividing 
the distance from the detonation point to the cente r of the element by the detonation 
velocity, |u1D437.  If multiple detonation points are deﬁned, the cl osest detonation point 
determines t l.  The burn fraction |u1D439 is taken as the maximum, 
|u1D439 = max(|u1D439|oneCst, |u1D439|twoCst)  , 
where 
|u1D439|oneCst=

where |u1D449/u1D4:6.st/u1D4:D.st is the Chapman-Jouguet relative volume and |u1D461 is current time.  If |u1D439 exceeds 1, 
it is reset to 1.  This calculation of the burn fra ction usually requires several time steps 
for |u1D439 to reach unity, thereby spreading the burn front o ver several elements.  After 
reaching unity, |u1D439 is held constant.  This burn fraction calculation is based on work by 
Wilkins [1964] and is also discussed by Giroux [197 3]. 
 
If the beta burn option is used, BETA = 1.0, any vo lumetric compression will cause 
detonation and  
|u1D439 = |u1D439|twoCst  . 
|u1D439|oneCst is not computed. BETA  =  1 does not allow for the  initialization of the lighting time. 
 
If the programmed burn is used, BETA = 2.0, the und etonated high explosive material 
will behave as an elastic perfectly plastic materia l if the bulk modulus, shear modulus, 
and yield stress are deﬁned.  Therefore, with this option the explosive material can 
compress without causing detonation.  The location and time of detonation is controlled 
by *INITIAL_DETONATION. 
 
As an option, the high explosive material can behav e as an elastic perfectly-plastic solid 
prior to detonation.  In this case we update the st ress tensor, to an elastic trial stress, ∗
