  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MU MU is the isotropic shear modulus that models elast in.  MU 
should be chosen such that the following relation i s satisﬁed: 
0.5 (3KAPPA − 2M U ) (3KAPPA + M U ) ⁄ < 0.5. 
Instability can occur for implicit simulations if t his quotient is 
close to 0.5. A modest approach is a quotient betwe en 0.495 and 
0.497. 
KAPPA Bulk modulus for the hydrostatic pressure. 
ACT ACT = 1 indicates that an active model will be used that acts i n 
the mean ﬁber- direction.  The active model, like the passive 
model, will be dispersed by SIGMA and F, or if INIT  = 1, with the 
*INITIAL_FIELD_SOLID keyword. 
INIT INIT = 1 indicates that the anisotropy eigenvalues will be  given 
by *INITIAL_FIELD_SOL ID variables in the global coordinate 
system (see Remark 1). 
FID The passive ﬁber model number.  There are two passi ve models 
available: FID = 1 or FID = 2. They are described i n Remark 2. 
ORTH ORTH speciﬁes the number (1 or 2) of ﬁbers use d.  When OR-
TH = 2 two ﬁber families are used and arranges symmetric ally 
THETA degrees from the mean ﬁber direction and lyin g in the 
tissue plane. 
C1-C3 Passive ﬁber model parameters. 
THETA The angle between the mean ﬁber direction and the ﬁ ber families.  
The parameter is active only if ORTH = 2 and is particularly 
important in vascular tissues (e.g. arteries)

EQ.0.0: original implementation (modiﬁed Neo-Hooke)  
EQ.1.0: standard Neo-Hooke model (as in umat45 of dyn21.f)  
ACT1 - 
ACT10 Active ﬁber model parameters.  Note that AC T10 is an input for a 
time dependent load curve that overrides some of th e ACTx 
values.  See section 2 below.

Details of the passive model can be found in Freed et al.  (2005) and Einstein et al.  
(2005).  The stress in the reference conﬁguration c onsists of a deviatoric matrix term, a 
hydrostatic pressure term, and either one (ORTHO = 1) or two (ORTH = 2) ﬁber terms:

where S is the second Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress tensor, J is the Jacobian of the deformation 
gradient, /u1D̅05 is the bulk modulus, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst is the passive ﬁber stress model used, and |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst is the 
corresponding active ﬁber model used.  The operator  DEV  is the deviatoric projection: 
/u1D40:/u1D404/u1D415 [•] = (•) −1

|u1D7≠6 is not a stretch in the classical way, since K embeds the concept of dispersion. K is 
called the dispersion tensor or anisotropy tensor a nd is given in global coordinates.  The 
passive and active ﬁber models are deﬁned in the ﬁb er coordinate system.  In eﬀect the 
dispersion tensor rotates and weights these one dim ensional models, such that they are 
both three-dimensional and in the Cartesian framewo rk. 
 
In the case where, the splay parameters SIGMA and F  are speciﬁed, K is given by:

 b)  The second ﬁber model available (FID = 2) is a sim pler but  more useful 
model for the general ﬁber reinforced rubber.  The ﬁber stress is simply 
given by: 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D436|oneCst|<racketleftCv6|u1D4J2/u1D4:6.st|twoCsts
|twoCst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠6Cst|twoCsts−|oneCst|parenriµhtCv2− 1|<racketriµhtCv6. 
The diﬀerence between the two ﬁber models is given in Figure M266-2 . 
The active model for myoﬁbers (ACT = 1) is deﬁned i n Guccione et al.  (1993)
