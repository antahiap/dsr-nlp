This is  Material Type 214. This material model can be used to model high strength 
woven fabrics, such as Kevlar ® 49, with transverse orthotropic behavior for use i n 
structural systems where high energy absorption is required (Bansal et al., Naik et al., 
Stahlecker et al.).  The major applications of the model are for the materials used in 
propulsion engine containment system, body armor an d personal protections. 
Woven dry fabrics are described in terms of two pri ncipal material directions, 
longitudinal warp and transverse ﬁll yarns.  The pr imary failure mode in these 
materials is the breaking of either transverse or l ongitudinal yarn.  An equivalent 
continuum formulation is used and an element is des ignated as having failed when it 
reaches some critical value for strain in either di rections.  A linearized approximation to 
a typical stress-strain curve is shown in Figure M214-1  and to a typical engineering 
shear stress-strain curve is shown in the ﬁgure cor responding to the GAB i ﬁeld in the 
variable list.  Note that the principal directions are labeled |u1D44∆ for the warp and |u1D44F for the 
ﬁll, and the direction /u1D450 is orthogonal to |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F. 
The material model is available for membrane elemen ts and it is recommended to use a 
double precision version of LS-DYNA.

 where |u1D7≠∆post  and |u1D7≠≠post  are, respectively, the stress and strain demarcati ng the 
onset of nonlinear behavior.  The value of SIGPOST is the same in both the 
transverse and longitudinal directions, whereas |u1D7≠≠a,post  and |u1D7≠≠b ,post  depend on 
direction and are derived internally from EASF, EBS F, and SIGPOST.  The fail- 
ure strain, |u1D7≠≠[|u1D44∆Cst/|u1D44FCst],fail , speciﬁes the onset of failure and diﬀers in the l ongitudinal 
and transverse directions.  Lastly the exponent, |u1D4J1fac , determines the shape of 
nonlinear stress-strain curve between |u1D7≠≠post  and |u1D7≠≠[|u1D44∆Cst |u1D44FCst ⁄ ]/co⋯⋯a.stfail .
