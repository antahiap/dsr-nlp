  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
(recommended).  Crack widths are stored as extra hi s- 
tory variables 3, 4, 5. 
CONM Units (conversion) ﬂag: 
GT.0.0: factor to convert model mass units to kg 
EQ.-1.0: mass, length, time units in model are lbf × sec2/in, 
inch, sec. 
EQ.-2.0: mass, length, time units in model are g, cm, micros ec.  
EQ.-3.0: mass, length, time units in model are g, mm, msec. 
EQ.-4.0: mass, length, time units in model are metric ton, mm, 
sec. 
EQ.-5.0: mass, length, time units in model are kg, mm, msec.  
CONL Length units conversion factor: 
CONM.GT.0: CONL is the conversion factor from model length 
units to meters. 
CONM.LE.0: CONL is ignored. 
CONT Time units conversion factor: 
CONM.GT.0: CONT is the conversion factor from time units to 
seconds 
CONM.LE.0: CONT is ignored.

S2, … Volumetric strain values (natural logarithmic value s); see 
Remarks below.  A maximum of 8 values are allowed.

Remarks: 
Pressure is positive in compression; volumetric str ain is given by the natural log of the 
relative volume and is negative in compression.  Th e tabulated data are given in order 
of increasing compression, with no initial zero poi nt. 
 
If the volume compaction curve is omitted, the foll owing scaled curve is automatically 
used where |u1D4JD|oneCst is the pressure at uniaxial compressive failure fr om: *.   
 LS-PrePost, choosing Misc  → Model Info  will reveal the number of cracked elements and 
the maximum crack width in a given plot state.  
 
An ASCII aea_crack  output ﬁle is written if the command *DATABASE_BIN ARY_-
D3CRACK command is included in the input deck.  Thi s command does not have any 
bearing on the aforementioned binary crack database . *. _REINFORCEMENT

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
PID Part ID of reinforced elements.  If PID = 0, the reinforcement is 
applied to all parts which use the Winfrith concret e model. 
AXIS Axis normal to layer: 
EQ.1: A and B are parallel to global |u1D466 and /u1D46̅, respectively. 
EQ.2: A and B are parallel to global |u1D46J and /u1D46̅, respectively. 
EQ.3: A and B are parallel to global |u1D46J and |u1D466, respectively. 
COOR Coordinate location of layer: 
AXIS.EQ.1: |u1D46J-coordinate 
AXIS.EQ.2: |u1D466-coordinate 
AXIS.EQ.3: /u1D46̅-coordinate 
RQA Reinforcement quantity (A). 
RQB Reinforcement quantity (B). 
Remarks: 
1.  Reinforcement Quantity.   Reinforcement quantity is the ratio of area of 
reinforcement in an element to the element's total cross-sectional area in a giv- 
en direction.  This deﬁnition is true for both Opti ons 1 and 2.  Where the op- 
tions diﬀer is in the manner in which it is decided  which elements are 
reinforced.  In Option 1, the reinforced element ID s are spelled out.  In Option *
