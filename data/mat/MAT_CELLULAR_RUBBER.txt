MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
PR Poisson’s ratio; typical values are between 0.0 to 0.2. Due to the 
large compressibility of air, large values of Poiss on’s ratio 
generate physically meaningless results.

least square ﬁt is computed with uniaxial data.  The parameters 
given on Card 2a should be speciﬁed.  Also see *MAT _-
MOONEY_RIVLIN_RUB BER (material model 27).  A Poisson’s 
ratio of .5 is assumed for the void free rubber dur ing the ﬁt.   The 
Poisson’s ratio deﬁned on Card 1 is for the cellular rubber.  A 
void fraction formulation is used.

 Remarks: 
Rubber is generally considered to be fully incompre ssible since the bulk modulus 
greatly exceeds the shear modulus in magnitude.  To  model the rubber as an 
unconstrained material a hydrostatic work term, /u1D44A|u1D43BCst(/u1D4:D), is included in the strain energy 
functional which is function of the relative volume , /u1D4:D, [Ogden 1984]: 
/u1D44A(/u1D4:D|oneCst,/u1D4:D|twoCst,/u1D4:D) = |summationCv1 |u1D436|u1D4JDCst /u1D45E.st(/u1D4:D|oneCst− 3)|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JBCst

In order to prevent volumetric work from contributi ng to the hydrostatic work the ﬁrst 
and second invariants are modiﬁed as shown.  This p rocedure is described in more 
detail by Sussman and Bathe [1987]. 
 
The eﬀects of conﬁned air pressure in its overall r esponse characteristics is included by 
augmenting the stress state within the element by t he air pressure, that is, 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D46≠Cst|u1D4J8Cst − |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠∆air   , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D46≠Cst|u1D4J8Cst  is the bulk skeletal stress and |u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JFCst  is the air pressure.  |u1D7≠∆air  is computed from: 
|u1D7≠∆air = −|u1D4JD|zeroCst|u1D6F∆
1 + |u1D6F∆ −/u1D̅1∫  , 
where |u1D4JD|zeroCst is the initial foam pressure usually taken as the atmospheric pressure and |u1D6F∆ 
deﬁnes the volumetric strain.  The volumetric is fo und with 
|u1D6F∆ = |u1D449 − 1 + |u1D6F∆|zeroCst  , 
where |u1D449 is the relative volume of the voids and |u1D6F∆|zeroCst is the initial volumetric strain which 
is typically zero.  The rubber skeletal material is  assumed to be incompressible. 
 
Rate eﬀects are taken into account through linear v iscoelasticity by a convolution 
integral of the form: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4 |u1D4J6Csts /u1D45̅.sts|u1D4J8Csts /u1D4⃡9.sts(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst 
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst  , 
or in terms of the second Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress, |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , and Green's strain tensor, |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , 
|u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D43A |u1D4J6Csts /u1D45̅.sts|u1D4J8Csts /u1D4⃡9.sts(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst 
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst  , 
where |u1D4J4 |u1D4J6Csts /u1D45̅.sts|u1D4J8Csts /u1D4⃡9.sts(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) and |u1D43A |u1D4J6Csts /u1D45̅.sts|u1D4J8Csts /u1D4⃡9.sts(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)are the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent stres s 
measures.  This stress is added to the stress tenso r determined from the strain energy 
functional.
