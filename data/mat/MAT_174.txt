 Creating sections for reinforced concrete beams: 
This material model can be used to represent unrein forced concrete (FRACR = 0), steel 
(FRACR = 1), or reinforced concrete with evenly dis tributed reinforcement 
(0 < FRACR < 1). 
Alternatively, use *INTEGRATION_BEAM to deﬁne the s ection, with the PID ﬁeld for 
each integration point being used to identify the M aterial to be used at that integration 
point.  Create one Part for concrete, and another f or steel.  These Parts should reference 
Materials, both of type *.   *.   
  
 
 
Monotonic loading of the reinforcement results in t he stress-strain curve shown, which 
is parabolic between εsh  and εult . The same curve acts as an envelope on the hystere tic 
behavior, when the x-axis is cumulative plastic str ain.  
 
Unloading from the yielded condition is elastic unt il the load reverses.  Thereafter, the 
Bauschinger Eﬀect (reduction in stiﬀness at stresse s less than yield during cyclic 
deformation) is represented by following a Ramberg- Osgood relationship until the 
yield stress is reached:
