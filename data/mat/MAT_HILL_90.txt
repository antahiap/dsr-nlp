This is  Material Type 243.  This model was developed by Hil l [1990] for modeling sheets 
with anisotropic materials under plane stress condi tions.  This material allows the use 
of the Lankford parameters for the deﬁnition of the  anisotropy.  All features of this 
model are the same as in *.

Generally, ITER = 0 is recommended.  However, ITER = 1 is 
somewhat faster and may give acceptable results in most 
problems. 
M m, exponent in Hill’s yield surface, absolute value  is used if 
negative.  Typically, m ranges between 1 and 2 for low- r 
materials, such as al uminum (AA6111: m≈1.5), and is greater than 
2 for high r-values, as in steel (DP600: m≈4).

Remarks: 
1.  The eﬀective plastic strain used in this model is deﬁned to be plastic work 
equivalent.  A consequence of this is that for para meters deﬁned as functions of 
eﬀective plastic strain, the rolling (00) direction  should be used as reference 
direction.  For instance, the hardening curve for H R = 3 is the stress as function *.   
 1 + 2|u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst =/u1D450|u1D4JACst+ |u1D44∆ +{(|u1D4JA + 2)/2|u1D4JA}|u1D44F
1 + |u1D44∆ +{(|u1D4JA − 2)/2|u1D4JA}|u1D44F 
If FLAG = 1, material parameters a (AH), b (BH), an d c (CH) are used directly. 
For material parameters a, b, c, and m, the followi ng condition has to be ful- 
ﬁlled, otherwise an error termination occurs: 
1 +/u1D450|u1D4JACst− 2|u1D44∆ + |u1D44F   >    0 
Two even more strict conditions should ensure conve xity of the yield surface 
according to Hill (1990).  A warning message will b e dumped if at least one of 
them is violated: 
|u1D44F > −2|parenleftCv3|u1D4JACst
|twoCst|parenriµhtCv3−|oneCst/u1D450|u1D4JACst 
|u1D44F > |u1D44∆|twoCst−/u1D450|u1D4JACst 
The yield strength of the material can be expressed  in terms of k and n: 
|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st=/u1D458|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JBCst=/u1D458|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst + |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2|u1D4JBCst 
where |u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst  is the elastic strain to yield and  |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain (loga- 
rithmic).  If SIGY is set to zero, the strain to yi eld if found by solving for the 
intersection of the linearly elastic loading equati on with the strain hardening 
equation: 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D438|u1D7≠≠ 
|u1D7≠∆ =/u1D458|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JBCst 
which gives the elastic strain at yield as: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst = |parenleftCvJ|u1D438
/u1D458|parenriµhtCvJ|<racketleftCv4|oneCst
|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst|<racketriµhtCv4
 
If SIGY yield is nonzero and greater than 0.02 then : 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst = |parenleftCv4|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st
/u1D458|parenriµhtCv4|<racketleftCv4|oneCst
|u1D4JBCst|<racketriµhtCv4
 
The other available hardening models include the Vo ce equation given by 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst |u1D4JDCsts, 
the Gosh equation given by 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst) =/u1D458(|u1D7≠≠|zeroCst+ |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst)|u1D4JBCst− |u1D4JD, 
and ﬁnally the Hocket-Sherby equation given by 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst |u1D4JDCsts/u1D45B.sts
. 
For the Gosh hardening law, the interpretation of t he variable SPI is the same, 
i.e., if set to zero the strain at yield is determi ned implicitly from the intersec- 
tion of the strain hardening equation with the line ar elastic equation. *
