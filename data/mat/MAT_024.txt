LS-DYNA R13 2-245 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
EQ.0.0:  Failure is not considered.  This option is recommen ded 
if failure is not of interest since many calculatio ns will 
be saved. 
GT.0.0: Eﬀective plastic strain to failure.  When the plast ic 
strain reaches this value, the element is deleted f rom 
the calculation.

C Strain rate parameter, |u1D436; see Remarks 1  and 3. 
P Strain rate parameter, |u1D4JD; see Remark 1 . 
LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID 
Load Curve.   When LC SS is a load curve ID, it is taken as 
deﬁning eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀective p lastic strain.  If 
deﬁned, EPS1 - EPS8 and ES1 - ES8 are ignored.  See  Remark 7  for 
load curve rediscretization behavior. 
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the stress as a function eﬀect ive plastic strain 
for that rate; see Figure M24-1 .  When the strain rate falls below 
the mi nimum value, the stress as a function of eﬀective p lastic 
strain curve for the lowest value of strain rate is  used.  Likewise, 
when the strain rate exceeds the maximum value the stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain curve for the h ighest value of 
strain rate is used.  C, P, LCSR, EPS1 - EPS8, and ES1 - ES8 are 
ignored if a table ID is deﬁned.  Linear interpolat ion between the 
discrete strain rates is used by default; logarithm ic interpolation 
is used when the LOG_INTERPOLATION option is invoke d. 
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   Logarithmic interpolation 
between discrete strain rates is also assumed if th e ﬁrst  value in 
the table is negative, in which case LS-DY NA assumes that all the 
table values represent the natural logarithm of a s t rain rate.  Since 
the tables are internally discretized to equally sp ace the table 
values, it makes good sense from an accuracy standp oint that the 
table values represent the natural log of strain ra te when the 
lowest strain rate and highest strain rate di ﬀer by several orders 
of magnitude.  Note that this option works only whe n the lowest 
strain rate has value less than 1.0. For values gre ater than or equal 
to 1.0, use the LOG_INTERPOLA TION option.  There is some 
additional computational cost associa ted with invoking 
logarithmic interpolation.  *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-247 (MAT) equivalent to eﬀective stress as a function eﬀectiv e plastic strain.  The most 
general approach is to use the table deﬁnition (LCS S) discussed below. 
Three options to account for strain rate eﬀects are  possible: 
a)  Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model 
which scales the yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  , 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate.  |u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst .  If VP = -1, the deviatoric strain rates 
are used instead. 
If the viscoplastic option is active (VP = 1.0) and  if SIGY is > 0 then the 
dynamic yield stress is computed from the sum of th e static stress, 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2, which is typically given by a load curve ID and t he initial yield 
stress, SIGY, multiplied by the Cowper-Symonds rate  term as follows: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 + SIG Y × |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst
|u1D436|parenriµhtCv6|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  . 
Here the plastic strain rate is used.  With this la tter approach similar re- 
sults to *.   *. .   *.  
except for the following points: 
• Load curve lookup for yield stress is based on eq uivalent uniaxial strain, 
not plastic strain (see Remarks 2  and 3). 
• Elastic stiﬀness is initially equal to |u1D438 but will be increased according to the 
slope of the stress-strain curve (see Remark 7 ). 
• Special strain calculation is used for failure an d damage (see Remark 2 ). 
• Failure strain depends on strain rate (see Remark 4 ). 
2.  Strain Calculation for Failure and Damage.   The strain used for failure and 
damage calculation, |u1D7≠≠pm , is based on an approximation of the greatest valu e of 
maximum principal strain encountered during the ana lysis: 
|u1D7≠≠pm = max 
|iCst≤|nCst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D43BCst|u1D4J6Cst+ |u1D7≠≠v m |u1D4J6Cst)  , 
where 
|u1D4JB = current time step index 
max 
|u1D4J6Cst≤|u1D4JBCst(. . . ) = maximum v alue attained b y the argument during the calculation 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D43BCst=|u1D7≠≠|u1D46JCst+ |u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst+ |u1D7≠≠|u1D467Cst

|u1D7≠≠|u1D46JCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D467Cst= cumulati v e strain in the local x, y, or z direction

setting the parameter VP to 1. *. . Note that for keeping the speed the tempera- 
ture used in the CRSH simulation should be constant  and the thermal solver 
should be inactive.  
7.  Heating and Cooling and Transformation Temperatures .  To activate the 
heating algorithm, set HEAT = 1 or 2. HEAT = 0 (def ault) activates only the 
cooling algorithm.  Note that for HEAT = 0 you must  check that the initial tem- 
perature of this material is above the start temper ature for the ferrite transfor- 
mation.  The transformation temperatures are echoed  in the messag  and d3hsp  
ﬁles.  
If HEAT > 0 the temperature that instantaneously tr ansforms all ferrite back to 
austenite is also echoed in the messag  ﬁle.  If you want to heat up to 100% 
austenite, you must let the specimen’s temperature exceed that temperature. *.  (see full description there).  Unlike *MAT _024, it has a 3D table option that 
uses a history variable (such as hardness and tempe rature) from a previous calculation 
to evaluate the plastic behavior as a function of 1 ) history variable, 2) strain rate, and 3) 
plastic strain.  Starting with release R12, it is a lso possible to use a 4D table option with 
two history variables, that is, the plastic behavio r would be a function of 1) history 
variable HISVN + 1, 2) history variable HISVN, 3) s train rate, and 4) plastic strain.  This 
material is available for shell and solid elements.
