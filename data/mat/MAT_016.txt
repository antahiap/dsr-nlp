LS-DYNA R13 2-201 (MAT) Examples of converting conventional triaxial compre ssion data to this type of 
model are found in Desai and Siriwardane, 1984.  No te that under convention- 
al triaxial compression conditions, the LS-DYNA inp ut corresponds to an ordi- 
nate of |u1D7≠∆|oneCst− |u1D7≠∆|threeCst rather than the more widely used (|u1D7≠∆|oneCst− |u1D7≠∆|threeCst) 2 ⁄, where |u1D7≠∆|oneCst is the 
maximum principal stress and |u1D7≠∆|threeCstis the minimum principal stress. 
This material combined with equation-of-state type 9 (saturated) has been used 
very successfully to model ground shocks and soil-s tructure interactions at 
pressures up to 100 kbars (approximately 1.5 × 106 psi). 
To invoke Mode I of this model, set  |u1D44∆|zeroCst, |u1D44∆|oneCst, |u1D44∆|twoCst, |u1D44F|oneCst, |u1D44∆0f , and |u1D44∆1f  to zero.  The tabu- 
lated values of pressure should then be speciﬁed on  Cards 4 and 5, and the 
corresponding values of yield stress should be spec iﬁed on Cards 6 and 7.  The 
parameters relating to reinforcement properties, in itial yield stress, and tangent 
modulus are not used in this response mode and shou ld be set to zero. 
Note that |u1D44∆1f  is reset internally to 1 3 ⁄ even though it is input as zero; this de- 
ﬁnes a failed material curve of slope 3|u1D4JD, where |u1D4JD denotes pressure (positive in 
compression).  In this case the yield strength is t aken from the tabulated yield 
as a function of pressure curve until the maximum p rincipal stress ( |u1D7≠∆|oneCst) in the 
element exceeds the tensile cutoﬀ |u1D7≠∆cut  (input as variable SIGF).  When |u1D7≠∆|oneCst> |u1D7≠∆cut  
is detected, the yield strength is scaled back by a  fraction of the distance be- 
tween the two curves in each of the next 20 time st eps so that after those 20 
time steps, the yield strength is deﬁned by the fai lure curve.  The only way to 
inhibit this feature is to set |u1D7≠∆cut  (SIGF) arbitrarily large. TrescaMohr-Coulomb

LS-DYNA R13 2-203 (MAT) c)  Model II.C (Tensile Failure plus Damage Scaling).  The change in yield stress 
as a function of plastic strain arises from the phy sical mechanisms such as 
internal cracking, and the extent of this cracking is aﬀected by the hydro- 
static pressure when the cracking occurs.  This mec hanism gives rise to the 
"conﬁnement" eﬀect on concrete behavior.  To accoun t for this phenome- 
non, a "damage" function was deﬁned and incorporate d.  This damage 
function is given the form: 
|u1D7≠6 =/integral.v:|parenleftCvJ1 +|u1D4JD
|u1D7≠∆cut |parenriµhtCvJ−|u1D44FCst|oneCsts
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠Cst|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst  . 
To use this model, deﬁne |u1D44∆|zeroCst, |u1D44∆|oneCst, |u1D44∆|twoCst, |u1D44∆0f , |u1D44∆1f , and |u1D44F|oneCst.  Cards 4 through 7 now 
give η as a function of λ. |u1D7≠2 scales the yield stress as 
|u1D7≠∆yield = |u1D7≠∆failed + |u1D7≠2(|u1D7≠∆max − |u1D7≠∆failed ) 
before applying any tensile failure criteria. 
3.  Mode II Concrete Model Options.  Material Type 16 Mode II provides for the 
automatic internal generation of a simple "generic"  model from concrete.  If A0 
is negative, then SIGF is assumed to be the unconﬁn ed concrete compressive 
strength, |u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst, and –A0 is assumed to be a conversion factor from  LS-DYNA pres- 
sure units to psi.  (For example, if the model stre ss units are MPa, A0  should be 
set to –145.) In this case the parameter values gen erated internally are 
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst= SIGF 
|u1D7≠∆cut = 1.7

 |u1D44∆0f = 0 
|u1D44∆1f = 0.3 85 
Note that these |u1D44∆0f  and |u1D44∆1f  defaults will be overridden by non-zero entries on  
Card 3.  If plastic strain or damage scaling is des ired, Cards 5 through 8 as well 
as |u1D44F|oneCst should be speciﬁed in the input.  When |u1D44∆|zeroCst is input as a negative quantity, 
the equation-of-state can be given as 0 and a trili near EOS Type 8 model will be 
automatically generated from the unconﬁned compress ive strength and Pois- 
son's ratio.  The EOS 8 model is a simple pressure as a function of volumetric 
strain model with no internal energy terms, and sho uld give reasonable results 
for pressures up to 5 kbar (approximately 75,000 ps i).

PER 100 ⁄ ) along with properties of the reinforcement materi al.  The bulk modu- *
