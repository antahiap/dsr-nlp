2-176 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
FLAG Flag for cold compression energy ﬁt (see Remarks 2  and 4): 
EQ.0.0:  |u1D7≠2 coeﬃcients (default) 
EQ.1.0:  |u1D7≠7 coeﬃcients 
MMN Optional |u1D7≠7 or |u1D7≠2 minimum value ( |u1D7≠7min  or |u1D7≠2min ), depending on 
FLAG.   
MMX Optional |u1D7≠7 or |u1D7≠2 maximum value ( |u1D7≠7max  or |u1D7≠2max ), depending on 
FLAG.   
EC0, …, EC9 Cold compression energy coeﬃcients (opt ional).  See Remark 2 .

1.  References.   Users who have an interest in this model are enco uraged to 
study the paper by Steinberg and Guinan which provi des the theoretical basis.  
Another useful reference is the KOVEC user’s manual . 
2.  Shear Modulus.   In terms of the foregoing input parameters, we de ﬁne the 
shear modulus, |u1D43A, before the material melts as: 
|u1D43A = |u1D43A|zeroCst|<racketleftCvJ1 + |u1D44F|u1D4JD|u1D449|oneCst|threeCst/fraction.v2−ℎ|parenleftCvJ|u1D438|u1D4J6Cst− |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst

|u1D438Cst/u1D45A.sts−|u1D438Cst |u1D4J6Csts  , 
where |u1D4JD is the pressure, |u1D449 is the relative volume, |u1D438/u1D450 (see Remark 4 ) is the cold 
compression energy, and |u1D438|u1D4JACst is the melting energy.  |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst is given by: 
|u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst(|u1D46J) =/integral.v:|u1D4JD(/u1D44B)|u1D4J1 /u1D44B |u1D46JCst
|zeroCst−900|u1D44J|minuteCstexp(|u1D44∆|u1D46J)
(1 − |u1D46J)(/u1D6FE.st/o.sts−|u1D44∆Cst)   
with 
|u1D46J = 1 − |u1D449  . 
|u1D438|u1D4JA is deﬁned as: 
|u1D438|u1D4JACst(|u1D46J) = |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst(|u1D46J) + 3|u1D44J|minuteCst|u1D447Cst/u1D45A.sts(|u1D46JCst) . 
|u1D438|u1D4JACst is in terms of the melting temperature |u1D447|u1D4JACst(|u1D46J): 
|u1D447|u1D4JACst(|u1D46J) =|u1D447mo exp(2|u1D44∆|u1D46J)
|u1D449|twoCst|parenleftCv3/u1D6FE.st/u1D45C.sts−|u1D44∆Cst− |oneCst|threeCst/fraction.v2|parenriµhtCv3 
and the melting temperature at |u1D7≠+ = |u1D7≠+/u1D45C.st, |u1D447mo . 
In the above equations |u1D44J′ is deﬁned by  *.   
2-178 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 cause |u1D4JDcut  is measured positive in compression, while |u1D7≠∆max  is positive in 
tension.  Once spall is detected with this model, t he deviatoric stresses are 
reset to zero, and no hydrostatic tension ( |u1D4JD < 0 ) is permitted.  If tensile 
pressures are calculated, they are reset to 0 in th e spalled material.  Thus, 
the spalled material behaves as a rubble or incohes ive material. 
c)  Hydrostatic Tension Spall Model.   The hydrostatic tension spall model, 
SPALL = 3, detects spall if the pressure becomes mo re tensile than the 
speciﬁed limit, |u1D4JDcut .  Once spall is detected the deviatoric stresses a re reset 
to zero, and nonzero values of pressure are require d to be compressive 
(positive).  If hydrostatic tension ( |u1D4JD < 0 ) is subsequently calculated, the 
pressure is reset to 0 for that element. *. _LUND  
This is  Material Type 11.  This material is a modiﬁcation o f the Steinberg model above 
to include the rate model of Steinberg and Lund [19 89].  An equation of state 
determines the pressure.
