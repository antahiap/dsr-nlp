This is Material Type 136_STD, a plane stress ortho tropic material model for metal 
forming.  Yield surface construction is based on th e interpolation by second-order 
Bezier curves, and model parameters are determined directly from a set of mechanical 
tests conducted for a number of directions.  For ea ch direction, four mechanical tests are 
carried out: a uniaxial, an equi-biaxial, a plane s train tensile test and a shear test.  The 
material formulation is equivalent to .

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see*PART). 
RO Material density 
E Elastic Young’s modulus 
PR Poisson’s ratio 
N Order of the Fourier series (meaning number of test  groups minus 
one).  The minimum number for N is 2, and the maxim um is 10.

RBI0 Strain ratio |u1D7≠∆/˙.st |iCst (0 °)=|u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst(0 °)/|u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst(0 °) for equi- biaxial test in the 
rolling direction 
LCID Load curve ID or table ID.  If deﬁned, SYS, SIP, SH S, SHL, ESH, 
E0, DYS, RATEN, SRN0, and EXSR are ignored. 
Load Curve.   When LCID is a load curve ID, it is taken as 
deﬁning eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀective p lastic strain.  
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the stress as a function eﬀect ive plastic strain 
for that strain rate.    Linear interpolation betwe en the discrete 
strain rates is used by default. 
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   A way to invoke logarithmic 
interpolation between discrete strain rates is desc ribed as follows.  
If the ﬁrst  value in the table is negative, LS-DY NA assumes that 
all the table values represent the natural logarithm of a strain rate.  
There is some additional computational cost associa ted with 
invoking logarithmic interpolation.

 between the hinge points on both sides.  This dista nce is deﬁned by fac- 
tor  |u1D6F+ps = |u1D6F+|oneCst|u1D6F+|twoCst⁄, as shown in Figure M136-1 .  This approach is favored in most 
publications and has for example been discussed in the PhD-thesis of Pijlman, 
H. H. (2001). 
To determine the yield stress or reference points o f the Vegter yield locus, four 
mechanical tests must be performed for diﬀerent dir ections.  A good descrip- 
tion about the material characterization procedure can be found in Vegter et al.  
(2003). 
2.  Strain Hardening.   The Vegter yield function with isotropic hardenin g (AL-
PHA = 1) is given as: 
/u1D̅1∫= |u1D7≠∆e q (|u1D7≠∆|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|twoCst,/u1D̅0:) − |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̅̇|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|parenriµhtCv1 
with the equivalent stress |u1D7≠∆e q  obtained from the appropriate Bézier function 
related to the current stress state.  The uniaxial yield stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst can be deﬁned as 
a yield stress curve, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1, or a yield stress surface, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|parenriµhtCv1, with LCID. In
