Purpose: This is Material Type 187 (Semi-Analytical  Model for Polymers).  This material 
model uses an isotropic C-1 smooth yield surface fo r the description of non-reinforced 
plastics.  Details of the implementation are given in [Kolling, Haufe, Feucht and Du Bois 
2005]. 
This material law has been developed at DaimlerChry sler, Sindelﬁngen, in collaboration 
with Paul Du Bois and Dynamore, Stuttgart.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCID-T Load curve or table ID giving the yield stress as a  function of 
plastic strain.   These curves should be obtained f rom quasi- static 
and (optionally) dynamic uniaxial tensile tests.  T his input is 
mandatory, and the material model will not work unl ess at le ast 
one tensile stress-strain curve is given.  If LCID- T is a table ID, the 
table values are plastic strain rates, and a curve of yield stress 
versus plastic strain must be given for each of tho se strain rates.  
If the ﬁrst value in the table is negative, LS-DY NA assumes that 
all the table values represent the natural logarith m of plastic 
strain rate.  When the highest plastic strain rate is several orders 
of magnitude greater than the lowest strain rate, i t is 
recommended that the natural log of plastic strain rate be input in 
the table.  See Remark 4 . 
LCID-C Optional load curve ID giving the yield stress as a  function of 
plastic strain.  This curve should be obtained from  a quasi- static 
uniaxial compression test.   
LCID-S Optional load curve ID giving the yield stress as a  function of 
plastic strain.  This curve should be obtained from  a quasi- static 
shear test.   
LCID-B Optional load curve ID giving the yield stress as a  function of 
plastic strain, this curve should be obtained from a quasi- static 
biaxial tensile test. 
NUEP Plastic Poisson’s ratio: an estimated ratio of tran sversal to 
longitudinal plastic rate of deformation under unia xial loading 
should be given. 
LCID-P Load curve ID giving the plastic Poisson's ratio as a function of 
plastic strain during uniaxial tensile and uniaxial  compressive 
testing.  The plastic strain on the abscissa is neg ative for 
compression and positive for tension.    It is impo rtant to cover 
both tension and compression.  If LCID- P is given, NUEP is 
ignored. 
INCDAM Flag to control the damage evolution as a fu nction of triaxiality: 
EQ.0: Damage evolution is independent of the triaxiality.  
EQ.1: An incremental formulation is used to compute the 
damage. 
 *. -1  
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
EPFAIL This parameter is the equivalent plastic strain at failure under 
uniaxial tensile loading (history variable #2).  If  EP FAIL is given 
as a negative integer, a load curve is expected tha t deﬁnes EP-
FAIL as a function of the plastic strain rate.  Def ault value is 10 5. 
DEPRPT Increment of equivalent plastic strain under  uniaxia l tensile 
loading (history variable #2) between failure point  and rupture 
point.  Stresses will fade out to zero between EPFA IL and EP-
FAIL + DEPRPT. If DE PRPT is given a negative value, a curve 
deﬁnition is expected where DEPRPT is deﬁned as fun ctio n of the 
triaxiality. 
LCID_TRI Load curve that speciﬁes a factor that works multip licatively on 
the value of EPFAIL depending on the triaxiality (t hat is, |u1D4JD/|u1D7≠∆v M ). 
For a triaxiality of -1/3 a value of 1.0 should be speciﬁed. 
LCID_LC Load curve that speciﬁes a factor that works multip licatively on 
the value of EP FAIL depending on a characteristic element 
length, deﬁned as the average length of spatial dia gonals

MITER Maximum number of iterations in the cutting plane a lgorithm.  
The default is 400. 
MIPS Maximum number of iterations in the secant iteratio n performed 
to enforce plane stress (shell elements only).  The  default is 10. 
INCFAIL Flag to control the failure evolution as a function of triaxiality: 
EQ.0: Failure evolution is independent of the triaxiality . 
EQ.1: Incremental formulation is used to compute the fail ure 
value.  
EQ.-1: The failure model is deactivated. *. -1 accepts four diﬀerent kinds o f yield curves, LCID-T, LCID-C, 
LCID-S, and LCID-B where data from tension tests (L CID-T) is always required, but the *. -1  
 others are optional.  If fewer than three curves ar e deﬁned, as indicated by setting the 
missing load curve IDs to 0, the remaining curves a re generated internally. 
1.  Fewer than 3 load curves.   In the case of fewer than 3 load curves, a linear  
yield surface in the invariant space spanned by the  pressure and the von Mises 
stress is generated using the available data.  See Figure M187-2 . 
2.  Three or more load curves.   See Figure M187-3 . 
Remarks: 
1.  Damage.   If the LCID-D is given, then a damage curve as a function of 
equivalent plastic strains acting on the stresses i s deﬁned as shown in Figure 
M187-4 . 
Since the damaging curve acts on the yield values, the inelastic results are 
aﬀected by the damage curve.  As a means to circumv ent this, the load curve 
LCID-D may be given a negative ID. This will lead t o an internal conversion of 
from nominal to eﬀective stresses (ASSR).  While th is conversion is possible for 
some combinations of yield curve deﬁnitions, plasti c Poisson’s ratio and dam- 
age curves, the corresponding inverse problem canno t be solved for all combi- 
nations.  An error message is provided in this case . Figure M187-4.   EPFAIL and DE PRPT deﬁned the failure and fading behavior

Purpose: This is a slimmed-down form of Material Ty pe 187. In contrast to the original 
SAMP-1 the options here are limited to rate indepen dent or rate dependent ﬂow in 
tension and compression as well as constant or vari able plastic Poisson’s ratio.  Shear 
and biaxial test data are not incorporated.  Damage  and failure are not available here.

formulation for rate eﬀects: the viscoplastic formu lation (“VP = 1”) for *. _LIGHT.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCID-T Load curve or table ID giving the yield stress as a  function of 
plastic strain.   These curves should be obtained f rom quasi- static 
and (optionally) dynamic uniaxial tensile tests.  T his input is 
mandatory.  If LCID-T is a table ID, the table valu es are eﬀ ective 
strain rates, and a curve of yield stress as a func tion of plastic 
strain must be given for each of those strain rates .  If the ﬁrst 
value in the table is negative, LS-DY NA assumes that all the table 
values represent the natural logarithm of eﬀe ctive strain rate.  
When the highest eﬀective strain rate is several or ders of 
magnitude greater than the lowest strain rate, it i s recommended 
that the natural log of strain rate be input in the  table.  See 
Remark 1 . 
LCID-C Optional load curve (or table) ID giving the yield stress as a 
function of plastic strain (and strain rate).  This  curve (or table) 
should be obtained from uniaxial compression tests.   If LCID- C is 
deﬁned as a curve and LCID-T given as a table, then the rate 
dependence from the tension table is adopted in com pression as 
well.  See Remark 1 .

input as a constant with NUEP or as a function of e quivalent plastic strain with 
LCID-P.  The elasto-plastic equations are solved wi th a classical predictor-
corrector algorithm for the plastic strain incremen t ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst and stress /u1D̅48|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst. 
2.  Effective strain rate.  If tables are used for hardening, the rate depende nce is 
deﬁned by using an eﬀective strain rate.  To reduce  the noise from the elastic 
portion of that strain rate, an averaged value is u sed.  This is governed by the 
ﬁltering parameter RFILTF as shown above. 
3.  Nonlinear viscoelasticity . For LCEMOD ≠ 0, viscoelasticity is activated.  Wi th 
this model, EMOD becomes the Young’s modulus for eq uilibrium stress ( |u1D438e q ). 
LCEMOD speciﬁes the viscous Young’s modulus which i s a function of aver- 
aged strain rate ( |u1D438|u1D463Cst(|u1D7≠≠̇a v g )). BETA gives a constant decay parameter specifying  
the ratio |u1D438Cst/u1D463.sts(|u1D7≠≠Csṫa v g )
/u1Dℜ02.st(|u1D7≠≠Csṫa v g ) where |u1D7≠2 is the viscosity.  The viscoelastic stress-strain law is 
given by: 
|u1D7≠∆̇|u1D463Cst= −BETA × |u1D7≠∆(|u1D461) + |u1D438|u1D463Cst(|u1D7≠≠̇a v g ) × |u1D7≠≠̇a v g  
The one-dimensional viscoelastic behavior can be vi sualized by a generalized 
Maxwell cell as rheological model as shown in Figure M187-1 . 
We will be using the notation of the viscoelastic-p lastic stress update.  For sim- 
plicity we will discuss the one-dimensional case.  Let ∆|u1D7≠≠v p  be the viscoplastic 
strain increment and let |u1D7≠∆e q  and |u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst be the equilibrium and viscous stress por- 
tions.  The stress update is then: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D7≠∆e q |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst 
or with stress increments: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst+ ∆|u1D7≠∆e q + ∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst. *. _LIGHT
