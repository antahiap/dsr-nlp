 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
FFAILR Optional failure parameter.  If zero, the co rresponding force, |u1D439|u1D4JFCst, is 
not considered in the failure calculation.  See Remark 4 . *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
TFAILT Optional failure parameter.  If zero, the correspon ding rotation, 
/u1D̅0:|u1D461Cst, is not considered in the failure calculation. 
Remarks: 
1.  Null Load Curve IDs.   For null load curve IDs, no forces are computed. 
2.  Discrete Beam Formulation.  The formulation of the discrete beam (type 6) 
assumes that the beam is of zero length and require s no orientation node.  A 
small distance between the nodes joined by the beam  is permitted.  The local 
coordinate system which determines (|u1D4JF, |u1D46≠, |u1D461)  is given by the coordinate ID (see 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_ OPTION ) in the cross-sectional input (see *SEC-
TION_BEAM) where the global system is the default.  The local coordinate 
system axes can rotate with either node of the beam  or an average rotation of 
both nodes (see SCOOR variable in *SECTION_BEAM). 
3.  Tension and Compression.   If diﬀerent behavior in tension and compression 
is desired in the calculation of the force resultan ts, the load curve(s) must be 
deﬁned in the negative quadrant starting with the m ost negative displacement 
then increasing monotonically to the most positive.   If the load curve behaves 
similarly in tension and compression, deﬁne only th e positive quadrant.   
Whenever displacement values fall outside of the de ﬁned range, the resultant 
forces will be extrapolated.  Figure M67-1  depicts a typical load curve for a 
force resultant.  Load curves used for determining the damping forces and 
moment resultants always act identically in tension  and compression, since DISPLACEMENT| |DISPLACEMENT(a) (b)RESULTANT

Figure M67-1.   The resultant forces and moments are determined by a tab le 
lookup.  If the origin of the load curve is at [0,0]  as in (b) and tension and 
compression responses are symmetric. *
