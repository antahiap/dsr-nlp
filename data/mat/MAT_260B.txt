 Remarks: 
1.  Non-associated Flow Rule.  Referring to [ 1] and [ 2], Hill’s 1948 quadratic 
yield function is written as: 
|u1D4J3 (/u1D6D4,/u1D458) = |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt−/u1D458= 0  , 
where /u1D6D4 is the Cauchy stress tensor and |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt is the equivalent stress, deﬁned by: 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt=/radical.v1(/u1D40F /u1D6D4 )∙/u1D6D4  . 
/u1D40F is a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix deﬁned thro ugh three independent 
parameters, |u1D443|oneCst|twoCst , |u1D443|twoCst|twoCst , and |u1D443|threeCst|threeCst : 
/u1D40F=
⎣⎢⎡1 P|oneCst|twoCst 0
P|oneCst|twoCst P|twoCst|twoCst 0
0 0 P|threeCst|threeCst ⎦⎥⎤  . 
The ﬂow rule, which deﬁnes the incremental plastic strain tensor, is written as 
follows: 
|u1D4J1/u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst= |u1D4J1|u1D6FF |u1D71J|u1D4J4(/u1D6D4)
|u1D71J/u1D6D4  , 
where |u1D4J1|u1D6FF  is a scalar plastic multiplier.  The plastic poten tial function |u1D4J4(/u1D6D4) can 
be deﬁned as a quadratic function in stress space: 
|u1D4J4(/u1D6D4) =/radical.v1(/u1D406 /u1D6D4 )∙/u1D6D4 
with, 
/u1D406=
⎣⎢⎡1 |u1D43A|oneCst|twoCst 0
G|oneCst|twoCst G|twoCst|twoCst 0
0 0 G|threeCst|threeCst ⎦⎥⎤  . 
When /u1D40F/u1D406, the ﬂow rule is non-associated.  The associated ﬂo w rule is recov- 
ered if  /u1D40F=/u1D406. For example, /u1D40F can represent an isotropic von-Mises yield sur- 
face by setting |u1D443|oneCst|oneCst = |u1D443|twoCst|twoCst = 1.0 , |u1D443|oneCst|twoCst = −0.5 , and |u1D443|threeCst|threeCst = 3.0 .  /u1D406 can represent an 
orthotropic plastic ﬂow potential by setting: 
|u1D43A|oneCst|twoCst  = −|u1D4JF|zeroCst
1 + |u1D4JF|zeroCst  ,
|u1D43A|twoCst|twoCst  =|u1D4JF|zeroCst(1 + |u1D4JF/nine.st |zeroCst )
|u1D4JF/nine.st |zeroCst (1 + |u1D4JF|zeroCst)  ,
|u1D43A|threeCst|threeCst  =(1 + 2|u1D4JF|fourCst|fiveCst )(|u1D4JF|zeroCst+ |u1D4JF/nine.st |zeroCst )
|u1D4JF/nine.st |zeroCst (1 + |u1D4JF|zeroCst)  . 
Here |u1D4JF|zeroCst, |u1D4JF|fourCst|fiveCst , and |u1D4JF/nine.st |zeroCst  are the Lankford coeﬃcients in the rolling, diagon al and 
transverse directions, respectively.  Experiments h ave shown on the stress lev- 
el, some AHSS (Advanced High Strength Steel), e.g.,  DP590, and TRIP780 show 
strong directional dependency for the |u1D4JF-values, while nearly the same stress-
strain curves have been measured in all directions.   The directional dependen- 
cy of |u1D4JF-values suggests planar anisotropy while the materi al response for the *.

mal and adiabatic conditions ( |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D44∆Cst = DEPSAD).  For simplicity, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D461Cst = |u1D7≠≠̇|zeroCst×DEPS0. 
As shown in a single shell element undergoing uniax ial stretching (see Fig- 
ure M260B-1 ), the general eﬀect of LCIDV is to elevate the str ain hardening 
behavior as the strain rate increases (curve “D” in  Figure M260B-2  top), while 
the eﬀect of LCIDT is strain softening as the tempe rature rises (curve “C” in 
Figure M260B-2  top).  Initially, due to the combined eﬀect of bot h LCIDV and 
LCIDT strain hardening may occur before the tempera ture rises enough to 
cause strain softening in the model (curve “E” in Figure M260B-2  top).  The 
temperature and strain rates calculated for each el ement can be viewed with 
history variables #4 and #5 (curves “C” and “D” in Figure M260B-2  bottom), 
respectively, while the strain rate scale factors a nd temperature scale factors 
can be viewed with history variable #6 and #7, resp ectively. 
3.  Rate-dependent Hosford-Coulomb Fracture Initiation Model.   An 
extension of the Hosford-Coulomb fracture initiatio n model is used to account 
for the eﬀect of strain rate on ductile fracture.  The damage accumulation is 
calculated through history variable #3.  When this history variable reaches 1.0, 
fracture occurs at an equivalent plastic strain, |u1D7≠≠̅/u1D45:.st, that is, 
/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|u1D4J9Cst

|zeroCst = 1  . 
Here |u1D7≠≠̅/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JFCst , |u1D7≠2, and /u1D̅0:̅ are strain to fracture, stress triaxiality, and th e Lode parame- 
ter, respectively. 
The fracture parameters, A, B0, GAMMA, C, and N, ar e used in the following 
equations as ( |u1D44∆,  |u1D44F|zeroCst, |u1D6F∆, /u1D450, |u1D4JB), respectively.  Strain to fracture for a proporti onal 
load is given as: *.
