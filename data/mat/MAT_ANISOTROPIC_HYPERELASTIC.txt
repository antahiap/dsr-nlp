Remarks: 
1.  Volumetric Strain Energy Function.   The pure volumetric part of the strain 
energy function is deﬁned as part of the ISOtropic module. 
2.  Compressible and Nearly-Incompressible Models.  Depending on the sign 
of ITYPE and ATYPE, several formulations are availa ble.  Negative model 
numbers indicate that the corresponding part of the  strain energy function is 
considered isochoric.  Furthermore, the sign of FTY PE and INTYPE is directly 
linked to ATYPE.  For example, if ATYPE is negative , both ﬁber and ﬁber in- 
teraction models are in their isochoric form.  Cons equently, compressible and 
nearly-incompressible anisotropy is obtained by usi ng both INTYPE and 
ATYPE with or without a sign, respectively. 
3.  Incompressibility Limit. While there is no strict lower bound on the Poisson ’s 
ratio (|u1D71≠|u1D43FCst), for nearly-incompressible materials, LS-DYNA will  issue a warning 
message if  |u1D71≠ < |u1D71≠|u1D43FCst= 0.4 9. 
4.  Special Cases of the Compressible/Nearly-Incompress ible Ogden Model.   
The following described special cases of the OGDEN Model (ITYPE = ±1). 
a)  The (nearly-in)compressible neo-Hookean model is o btained as special 
case of ITYPE = (-)1 with |u1D7≠7|oneCst> 0, |u1D6F+|oneCst= 1. 
b)  The Mooney-Rivlin model is obtained as a special c ase of ITYPE = -1 with 
|u1D7≠7|u1D4J6Cst|u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst> 0 for i = 1,2 , |u1D6F+|oneCst= 2, and |u1D6F+|twoCst= −2 . *.   
 c)  For all ACTYPE methods, if you set up a coupled pr oblem with the elec- 
trophysiology solver, ACTHR again gives the thresho ld value for the cal- 
cium ion concentration (ACTYPE = 1, 2, 3, or 5) or transmembrane 
potential (ACTYPE = 4).  The electrophysiology solv er provides the value 
to compare to the threshold to activate and deactiv ate the active stress de- 
velopment.  As with ACID, the active stress develop ment is activated 
when the value exceeds ACTHR and deactivates when t he value is less 
than ACTHR. With this method, the active stress dev elopment can be re- 
activated again when the value exceeds the threshol d. 
9.  Active stress development. Active stress is developed along direction(s) 
deﬁned by ACDIR and may be scaled using the scaling  factors SF, SS, and SN. 
For ACTYPE < 5, if SS and SN are zero, they are res et internally to ST.  
Depending on ACDIR active stress may develop along one or multiple ﬁber 
families.  Consider a single ﬁber family with unit ﬁber orientation vector /u1D41E/u1D45:.st. Let 
/u1D̅0F|u1D434Cst be the active stress.  Then, the active stress ten sor in the local ﬁber frame is: 
/u1D̅4∫|u1D434Cst=  /u1D̅0F|u1D434Cst|parenleftCv2SF /u1D41E/u1D45:.st⊗/u1D41E/u1D45:.st+ SS /u1D41E|u1D46≠Cst⊗/u1D41E|u1D46≠Cst+ SN /u1D41E|u1D4JBCst⊗/u1D41E|u1D4JBCst|parenriµhtCv2  . 
Here /u1D41E|u1D46≠Cst and /u1D41E|u1D4JBCst are the unit vectors in the sheet and normal direc tions that form 
a basis with /u1D41E/u1D45:.st. 
If active tension develops along multiple ﬁber fami lies, then the active stress 
tensor is: 
/u1D̅4∫|u1D434Cst= |summationCv1/u1D̅4∫|u1D434Cst|u1D4J6CstsNF 
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
In the above NF is the number of ﬁber families and /u1D̅4∫|u1D434Cst|u1D4J6Csts is the active stress ten- 
sor for the ith  ﬁber family. 
10.  Serial stress function. The serial stress function needs to be expressed in  
terms of the ﬁber stretch λ and contractile stretch λCE . Thus, the elastic stretch 
in the serial element  λSE  needs to be eliminated using the multiplicative de - 
composition of the ﬁber stretch, that is, λ=λ/C.st/E.st λ/S.st/E.st . 
11.  History Variables.   The history variables are listed in the table bel ow.  The 
default number of history variables depends on the used modules.  If only the 
mandatory ISOtropic module is used, the number of h istory variables is 9. In- 
cluding the ANISOtropic and ACTIVE modules in a hie rarchical fashion yields 
an additional 12 and 9 history variables, that is, making the total number of 
history variables 21 and 30, respectively.
