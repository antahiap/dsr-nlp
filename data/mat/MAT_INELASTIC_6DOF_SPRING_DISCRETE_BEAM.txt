This is Material Type 95.  This material model is d eﬁned for simulating the eﬀects of 
nonlinear inelastic and nonlinear viscous beams by using six springs each acting about 
one of the six local degrees-of-freedom.  The input  consists of part IDs that reference 
material type *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
RPIDT Rotational motion about the local |u1D461-axis is governed by part ID 
RPIDT .  If zero, no moment is computed about this axis. 
Remarks: 
Rotational displacement is measured in radians. *
