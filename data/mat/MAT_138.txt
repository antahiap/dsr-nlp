Remarks: 
1.  Ultimate Displacements.  The ultimate displacements in the normal and 
tangential directions are the displacements at the time when the material has 
failed completely, that is, the tractions are zero.   The linear stiﬀness for loading 
followed by the linear softening during the damage provides an especially 
simple relationship among the energy release rates,  peak tractions, and ulti- 
mate displacements: 
GIC = |u1D447 ×U ND 
2
GIIC = |u1D446 ×U TD 
2 *.   
 A reasonable choice for the exponent |u1D6F∆ would be GAMMA = 1.0 (default) or 
GAMMA = 2.0. 
3.  Interface Damage.   In this model, damage of the interface is conside red, that 
is, irreversible conditions are enforced with loadi ng/unloading paths coming 
from/pointing to the origin. 
4.  Peak Tractions as Load Curves.   Peak tractions |u1D447 and/or |u1D446 can be deﬁned as 
functions of characteristic element length (square root of mid-surface area) 
using a load curve.  This option helps obtain the s ame global responses (e.g. 
load-displacement curve) with coarse meshes when co mpared to a ﬁne mesh 
solution.  In general, lower peak traction values a re needed for coarser meshes.  
5.  Error Checks of Material Data.   Two error checks have been implemented for 
this material model in order to ensure proper mater ial data.  Since the traction 
as a function of displacement curve is fairly simpl e (triangular shaped), equa- 
tions can be developed to ensure that the displacem ent, /u1D4:F, at the peak load 
(QMAX), is smaller than the ultimate distance for f ailure, |u1D462.  See Figure M138-2  
for the used notation.

To ensure that the peak is not past the failure poi nt, |u1D462/u1D4:F⁄ must be larger than 1.

Third formulation (TES = 2.0): 
Here, a dimensionless eﬀective separation parameter  |u1D7≠6 is used, which grasps for the 
interaction between relative displacements in norma l ( |u1D6FF|threeCst - mode I) and tangential ( |u1D6FF|oneCst,|u1D6FF|twoCst 
- mode II) directions:

where the Mc-Cauley bracket is used to distinguish between tension ( |u1D6FF|threeCst≥ 0) and 
compression ( |u1D6FF|threeCst< 0). |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st|u1D439Cst and |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st|u1D439Cst are critical values, representing the maximum 
separations in the interface in normal and tangenti al direction .  For stress calculation, 
the normalized traction-separation load curve TSLC is used: |u1D461 = |u1D461|mCst|aCst|xCst × |u1D461̅(|u1D7≠6). This 
formulation is similar to . ). 
 
After the shape of the mixed-mode traction-separati on law has been determined by |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|oneCst,

calculated.  The plastic separation in peel directi on is given by
