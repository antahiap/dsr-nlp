This is Thermal Material Type 4.  It allows tempera ture dependent orthotropic 
properties to be deﬁned.  The temperature dependenc y is deﬁned by specifying a 
minimum of two and a maximum of eight data points.  The properties must be deﬁned 
for the temperature range that the material will se e in the analysis.

This is Thermal Material Type 8. With this model, o rthotropic thermal properties that 
are dependent on temperature (and/or mechanical his tory variables) can be speciﬁed 
with load curves.  The properties must be deﬁned fo r the temperature (and/or history 
variable) range that the material will see in the a nalysis.
