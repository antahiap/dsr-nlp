 Four characteristic  stress states are selected as reference points: the equi-biaxial point 
(|u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|u1D4J6Cst , |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|u1D4J6Cst ), the plane strain point |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst|u1D46≠Cst|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst|u1D46≠Cst|twoCst|parenriµhtCv2, the uniaxial point (|u1D7≠∆|u1D462Cst|u1D4JBCst , 0) and the pure 
shear point (|u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst/uni210E.st, −|u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst/uni210E.st); see Figure M136-2 . Between the 4 stress points, 3 Bézier curves 
are used to interpolate the yield locus.  Symmetry conditions are used to construct the 
complete surface.  The yield locus in Figure M136-2  shows the reference points of 
experiments for one speciﬁc direction.  The referen ce points can also be determined for 
other angles to the rolling direction (planar angle  /u1D̅0:). For example, if N = 2 is chosen, 
normalized yield stresses for directions 0°, 45°, a nd 90° should be deﬁned.  A Fourier 
series is used to interpolate intermediate angles b etween the measured points. 
The Vegter yield function with isotropic hardening (ALPHA = 1) is given as: 
/u1D̅1∫= |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|twoCst,/u1D̅0:) − |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1 
with the equivalent stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st obtained from the appropriate Bézier function rela ted to 
the current stress state.  The uniaxial yield stres s |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst can be deﬁned as stress-strain curve 
LCID or alternatively as a functional expression: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ ∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JACst/˙racketleft.v:|u1D6FD(|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst+ |u1D7≠≠|zeroCst) +|parenleftCv31 − |u1D4J2−/Ome∧∙.st(|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|u1D4JDCsts+|u1D7≠≠Cst|zeroCsts)|parenriµhtCv3|u1D4JBCst/˙racketright.v: 
In case of kinematic hardening (ALPHA < 1), the sta ndard stress tensor is replaced by a 
relative stress tensor, deﬁned as the diﬀerence bet ween the stress tensor and a back 
stress tensor. 
 
To determine the yield stress or reference points o f the Vegter yield locus, four 
mechanical tests have to be performed for diﬀerent directions.  A good description 
about the material characterization procedure can b e found in Vegter et al.  (2003). *. _STANDARD  
This is Material Type 136_STD, a plane stress ortho tropic material model for metal 
forming.  Yield surface construction is based on th e interpolation by second-order 
Bezier curves, and model parameters are determined directly from a set of mechanical 
tests conducted for a number of directions.  For ea ch direction, four mechanical tests are 
carried out: a uniaxial, an equi-biaxial, a plane s train tensile test and a shear test.  The 
material formulation is equivalent to . _STANDARD

deﬁning eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀective p lastic strain.  
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the stress as a function eﬀect ive plastic strain 
for that strain rate.    Linear interpolation betwe en the discrete 
strain rates is used by default. 
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   A way to invoke logarithmic 
interpolation between discrete strain rates is desc ribed as follows.  
If the ﬁrst  value in the table is negative, LS-DY NA assumes that 
all the table values represent the natural logarithm of a strain rate.  
There is some additional computational cost associa ted with 
invoking logarithmic interpolation.

second-order Bezier curves.  Model parameters are d etermined from uniaxial test data 
at 0°, 45° and 90° to the rolling direction.  There fore, the same mechanical tests must be 
carried out as for Hill’s 1948 planar anisotropic m aterial model.  For a more detailed 
description of the yield locus, please see Vegter a nd Boogaard [2006].  The relationships 
between the results of uniaxial testing and the adv anced yield locus are introduced and 
discussed in Abspoel et al [2017].
