λ, sometimes referred to as “modiﬁed” eﬀective plast ic strain, is computed internally as 
a function of eﬀective plastic strain, strain rate enhancement factor, and pressure.  η is a 
function of λ as speciﬁed by the η as a function of λ curve.  The η value, which is always 
between 0 and 1, is used to interpolate between the  yield failure surface and the 
maximum failure surface or between the maximum fail ure surface and the residual *.  
Sample Input for Concrete: 
As an example of the K&C Concrete Model material pa rameter generation, the 
following sample input for a 45.4 MPa (6,580 psi) u nconﬁned compression strength 
concrete is provided.  The basic units for the prov ided parameters are length in *.   
 millimeters (mm), time in milliseconds (msec), and mass in grams (g).  This base unit set 
yields units of force in Newtons (N) and pressure i n Mega-Pascals (MPa).
