  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
GMOD Elastic shear modulus 
RNU Poisson’s ratio 
RKF Failure surface shape parameter 
PHI Angle of friction (radians) 
CVAL Cohesion value 
PSI Dilation angle (radians) 
STR_LIM Minimum shear strength of material is given  by STR_LIM*CVAL  
GMODDP Depth at which shear modulus (GMOD) is corre ct 
PHIDP Depth at which angle of friction (PHI) is cor rect 
CVALDP Depth at which cohesion value (CVAL) is corr ect 
PSIDP Depth at which dilation angle (PSI) is correc t 
GMODGR Gradient at which shear modulus (GMOD) incre ases with depth 
PHIGR Gradient at which friction angle (PHI) increa ses with depth 
CVALGR Gradient at which cohesion value (CVAL) incr eases with depth 
PSIGR Gradient at which dilation angle (PSI) increa ses with depth 
Remarks: 
1.  Orientation.  This material type requires that the model is orien ted such that 
the /u1D46̅-axis is deﬁned in the upward direction.  The key p arameters are deﬁned 
such that may vary with depth (i.e. the /u1D46̅-axis). 
2.  Shape Factor.  The shape factor for a typical soil would be 0.8 bu t should not 
be pushed further than 0.75. 
3.  STR_LIM.   If STR_LIM is set to less than 0.005, the value i s reset to 0.005. 
4.  Yield Function.  The yield function is deﬁned as: 
|u1D461 − |u1D4JD × tan |u1D6FD − |u1D4J1 = 0
