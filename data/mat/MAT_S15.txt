Remarks: 
The material behavior of the muscle model is adapte d from the original model 
proposed by Hill [1938].  Reviews of this model and  extensions can be found in Winters 
[1990] and Zajac [1989].  The most basic Hill-type muscle model consists of a contractile 
element (CE) and a parallel elastic element (PE) ( Figure MS15-1 ).  An additional series 
elastic element (SEE) can be added to represent ten don compliance. 
 
The main assumptions of the Hill model are that the  contractile element is entirely 
stress free and freely distensible in the resting s tate and is described exactly by Hill’s 
equation (or some variation).  When the muscle is a ctivated, the series and parallel 
elements are elastic, and the whole muscle is a sim ple combination of identical 
sarcomeres in series and parallel.  The main critic ism of Hill’s model is that the division 
of forces between the parallel elements and the div ision of extensions between the series 
elements is arbitrary and cannot be made without in troducing auxiliary hypotheses.  
However, these criticisms apply to any  discrete element model.  Despite these *.

|u1D449max × |u1D446|u1D463Cst[|u1D44∆(|u1D461)] 
Here, |u1D446|u1D463Cst scales the maximum CE shortening velocity |u1D449max  and changes with activation 
level |u1D44∆(|u1D461). This has been suggested by several researchers, t hat is, Winters and Stark 
[1985].  The activation level speciﬁes the level of  muscle stimulation as a function of 
time.  Both have values between 0 and 1. The functi ons |u1D446|u1D463Cst[|u1D44∆(|u1D461)]  and |u1D44∆(|u1D461) are speciﬁed 
using load curves in LS-DYNA, but the default value s of |u1D446v= 1 and |u1D44∆(|u1D461) = 0  can also be 
used.  Note that /u1D4:F is always positive and that |u1D449 is positive for lengthening and negative 
for shortening. 
 
The relationship between |u1D439CE , |u1D449 and /u1D4:F was proposed by Bahler et al.  [1967].  A three-
dimensional relationship between these quantities i s now considered standard for 
computer implementations of Hill-type muscle models  [Winters 1990].  It can be written 
in dimensionless form as: 
|u1D439/C.st/E.st = |u1D44∆(|u1D461) × |u1D439|mCst|aCst|xCst × |u1D4J3/ε.st /L.st (/u1D4:F) × |u1D4J3/ε.st /V.st (|u1D449) . 
Here, |u1D4J3TL (/u1D4:F) and |u1D4J3T V (|u1D449) are the tension-length and tension-velocity functi ons for active 
skeletal muscle.  Thus, if current values of /u1D4:FM, |u1D449M, and |u1D44∆(|u1D461) are known, then |u1D439CE  can be 
determined ( Figure MS15-1 ). 
 
If FPE = 0.0, the force in the parallel elastic ele ment, |u1D439PE , is determined directly from the 
current length of the muscle using an exponential r elationship [Winters 1990]: 
|u1D4J3PE =|u1D439/P.st/E.st 
|u1D439/M.st /A.st/X.st =

/u1D4:F|mCst|aCst|xCst (/u1D4:F− 1) |<racketriµhtCvJ− 1|<raceriµhtCvJ/u1D4:F> 1 
Here, /u1D4:F|mCst|aCst|xCst  is the dimensionless length at which the force |u1D439max  occurs, and |u1D43∆sh  is a 
dimensionless shape parameter controlling the rate of rise of the exponential.  
Alternatively, the user can deﬁne a custom |u1D4J3PE  curve giving tabular values of 
normalized force as a function of dimensionless len gth as a load curve. 
 
For computation of the total force developed in the  muscle |u1D439M, the functions for the 
tension-length |u1D4J3TL (/u1D4:F) and force-velocity f TV  relationships used in the Hill element must 
be deﬁned.  These relationships have been available  for over 50 years but have been 
reﬁned to allow for behavior such as active lengthe ning.  The active tension-length 
curve |u1D4J3TL (/u1D4:F) describes the fact that isometric muscle force dev elopment is a function of 
length, with the maximum force occurring at an opti mal length.  According to Winters, 
this optimal length is typically around /u1D4:F= 1.05 , and the force drops oﬀ for shorter or 
longer lengths, approaching zero force for /u1D4:F= 0.4  and /u1D4:F= 1.5 . Thus the curve has a 
bell-shape.  Because of the variability in this cur ve between muscles, the user must 
specify the function |u1D4J3|u1D447Cst|u1D43FCst (/u1D4:F) using a load curve, specifying pairs of points rep resenting *
