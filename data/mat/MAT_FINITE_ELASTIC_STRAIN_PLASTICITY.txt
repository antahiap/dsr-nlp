This is  Material Type 112.  An elasto-plastic material with  an arbitrary stress versus 
strain curve and arbitrary strain rate dependency c an be deﬁned.  The elastic response 
of this model uses a ﬁnite strain formulation so th at large elastic strains can develop 
before yielding occurs.  This model is available fo r solid elements only.  See Remarks 
below.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
E Young’s modulus 
PR Poisson’s ratio 
SIGY Yield stress 
ETAN Tangent modulus; ignored if LCSS > 0  
C Strain rate parameter, |u1D436; see Remarks below.  
P Strain rate parameter, |u1D4JD; see Remarks below. 
LCSS Load curve ID or table ID.   
Load Curve ID.   The load curve deﬁnes eﬀective stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain.  If deﬁned, EP S1 - EPS8 and 
ES1 - ES8 are ignored.   
Table ID. The table deﬁnes for each strain rate value a load curve 
ID giving the stress as a function of eﬀective plas tic strain for that 
rate; see Figure M24-1 .  Th e stress as a function of eﬀective plastic 
strain curve for the lowest value of strain rate is  used if the strain 
rate falls below the minimum value.  Likewise, the stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain curve for the h ighest value of 
strain rat e is used if the strain rate exceeds the maximum va lue.  
The strain rate parameters, |u1D436 and |u1D4JD; the curve ID LCSR; EPS1 -
 EPS8; and ES1 - ES8 are ignored if a table ID is d eﬁned.
