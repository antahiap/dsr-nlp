strain. 
The systolic contraction is modeled as the sum of t he passive stress derived 
from the strain energy function and an active ﬁber directional component, |u1D447|zeroCst, 
which is a function of time, |u1D461,

formation tensor; /u1D4:D, the Jacobian of the deformation gradient tensor /u1D405; and /u1D6D4, 
the Cauchy stress tensor. 
The active ﬁber directional stress component is deﬁ ned by a time-varying elas-

Here, |u1D447|mCst|aCst|xCst  is the maximum isometric tension achieved at the l ongest sarco-
