RO Mass density 
AOPT Material axes option (see MAT _OPTION TROPIC_ELASTIC for a 
more complete description): 
EQ.0.0: locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes 1, 2, and 4, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_ NODES, and then, for shells only, rotated about 
the shell element normal by an angle, BETA.

point in space and the global location of the eleme nt 
center; this is the |u1D44∆-direction.  This option is for solid 
elements only. 
EQ.2.0: globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR. 
EQ.3.0: locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector, /u1D42F, with the 
element normal. 
EQ.4.0: locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector, /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D4JD, which deﬁne the centerline axis.  
This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: the absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR).  Available in R3 version of 971 
and later. 
REF Use reference geometry to initialize the stress ten sor.  The 
reference geometry is deﬁned by the keyword: *INITI AL_-

keyword for more details).

where |u1D447 is temperature.  After computing |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  we then obtain the Cauchy stress: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst∂|u1D46J|u1D4J6Cst

This model will predict realistic behavior for ﬁnit e displacement and rotations as long 
as the strains are small. 
 
For shell elements, the stresses are integrated in time and are updated in the 
corotational coordinate system.  In this procedure the local material axes are assumed to 
remain orthogonal in the deformed conﬁguration.  Th is assumption is valid if the 
strains remain small. *
