These are  Material Types 41 - 50. The user must provide a mat erial subroutine.  See also 
Appendix A. This keyword input is used to deﬁne mat erial properties for the 
subroutine.  Isotopic, anisotropic, thermal, and hy perelastic material models with 
failure can be handled.

MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
MT User material type (41 - 50 inclusive).  A number between 41 and 
50 must be chosen.  If MT < 0, subroutine rwumat  in dyn21.f  is 
called, where the material parameter reading can be  modiﬁed. 
WARNING : If two or more materials in an input 
deck share the same MT value, those materials must 
have the same values of other variables on Cards 1 
and 2 except for  MID and RO.   
LMC Length of material constant array which is equal to the number of 
material constants to be input.  See Remark 2 . 
NHV Number of history variables to be stored; see Appen dix A. When 
the model is to be used with an equation of state, NHV must be 
increase d by 4 to allocate the storage required by the equa tion of 
state.

AOPT Material axes option (see *MAT _002 for a more complete 
description): 
EQ.0.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
element nodes 1, 2, and 4, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_ NODES, and then, for shells only, rotated about 
the shell element normal by an angle BETA 
EQ.1.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y a 
point in space and the global location of the eleme nt 
center; this is the |u1D44∆-direction.  This option is for solid 
elements only. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR. 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector /u1D42F with the 
element normal. 
EQ.4.0: Locall y orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate system 
with the material axes determined by a vector  /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D4JD, which deﬁne the centerline axis.  *.

Remarks: 
1.  Cohesive Elements.   Material models for the cohesive element (solid e lement 
type 19) uses the ﬁrst two material param eters to set ﬂags in the element formula- 
tion . 
a)  P1.   The P1 ﬁeld controls how the density is used to c alculate the mass 
when determining the tractions at mid-surface (trac tions are calculated on 
a surface midway between the surfaces deﬁned by nod es 1-2-3-4 and 5-6-
7-8).  If P1 is set to 1.0, then the density is per  unit area of the mid-surface 
instead of per unit volume.  Note that the cohesive  element formulation 
permits the element to have zero or negative volume . *
