pressure to zero, an open cell, cellular rubber can be simulated. *.   
 Since we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, t he relaxation function is represented 
by one term from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
given by, 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D438/u1D451.st|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|oneCsts|u1D461Cst. 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a damper and spring in 
series.  We characterize this in the input by a she ar modulus, |u1D43A, and decay constant, |u1D6FD|oneCst. 
 
The Mooney-Rivlin rubber model (model 27) is obtain ed by specifying N = 1 without 
air pressure and viscosity.  In spite of the diﬀere nces in formulations with Model 27, we 
ﬁnd that the results obtained with this model are n early identical with those of material 
type 27 as long as large values of Poisson’s ratio are used. *
