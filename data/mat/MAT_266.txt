 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number must b e speciﬁed. 
RO Mass density. 
F Fiber dispersion parameter governs the extent to wh ich the ﬁber 
dispersion extends to the third dimension. F = 0  and F = 1  apply 
to 2D splay with the normal to the membrane being i n the  |u1D6FD and 
the |u1D6F∆-directions, respectively (see Figure M266-1 ). F = 0.5  applies 
to 3D splay with transverse isotropy.  Splay will b e orthotropic 
whenever F≠0.5. This parameter is ignored if INIT = 1. 
SIGMA The parameter SIG MA governs the extent of dispersion, such that 
as SIG MA goes to zero, the material symmetry reduces to p ure 
transverse isotropy.  Conversely, as SIG MA becomes large, the 
material symmetry becomes isotropic in the plane.  This 
parameter is ignored if INIT = 1. *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
element nodes 1, 2, and 4, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_NODES.  
EQ.1.0: locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y a 
point in space and the global location of the eleme nt 
center; this is the |u1D44∆-direction. 
EQ.2.0: globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR.  
EQ.3.0: locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector v with th e 
element normal.  
EQ.4.0: locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, /u1D42∫, which deﬁne the centerline ax- 
is. 
LT.0.0: the absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR). 
BETA Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 3, may be overridden on 
the element card *ELEMANT_SOLID_ORTHO. 
XP - ZP XP, YP and ZP deﬁne the coordinates of poin t P for AOPT = 1 and 
AOPT = 4. 
A1 - A3 A1, A2 and A3 deﬁne the components of vecto r A for AOPT = 2. 
D1 - D3 D1, D2 and D3 deﬁne components of vector D for AOPT = 2. 
V1 - V3 V1, V2 and V3 deﬁne components of vector V for AOPT = 3 and 
AOPT = 4. *.   
 where Q is the transformation tensor that rotates from the  local to the global Cartesian 
system.  In the case when INIT = 1, the dispersion tensor is given by 
/u1D40∅|u1D4J6Cst=/u1D410|u1D4J6Cst

/u1D410|u1D4J6Cst|u1D447Cst 
where the /u1Dℜ12:s are given on the *INITIAL_FIELD_SOLID card.  For  the values to be 
physically meaningful /u1Dℜ12|u1D4J6Cst|oneCst+/u1Dℜ12|u1D4J6Cst|twoCst+/u1Dℜ12|u1D4J6Cst|threeCst= 1. It is the responsibility of the user to assure tha t 
this condition is met, no internal checking for thi s is done.  These values typically come 
from diﬀusion tensor data taken from the myocardium . 
Remarks: 
1.  Passive ﬁber models.  Currently there are two mode ls available. 
a)  If  FID = 1 a crimped ﬁber model is used.  It is s olely developed for colla- 
gen ﬁbers.  Given  /u1D4:B|zeroCst and |u1D44J|zeroCst compute:  
/u1D4:F|zeroCst=/radical.v2(2/u1D̅0B)|twoCst+ (/u1D4:B|zeroCst)|twoCst,Λ=/u1D4:F|zeroCst
/u1D4:B|zeroCst 
and 
|u1D438|u1D46≠Cst=|u1D438/u1D45:.st/u1D4:B|zeroCst
/u1D4:B|zeroCst+ |parenleftCv61 +3 7

/u1D̅0B|twoCst|parenriµhtCv6 (/u1D4:F|zeroCst−/u1D4:B|zeroCst). 
Now if the ﬁber stretches |u1D7≠6 <Λ the ﬁber stress is given by: 
|u1D7≠∆ =/u1D̅0∫|u1D438|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠6 − 1) 
where 
/u1D̅0∫=6/u1D̅0B|twoCst|parenleftCv2Λ|twoCst+ |parenleftCv24/u1D̅0B|twoCst− 1|parenriµhtCv2|u1D7≠6|twoCst|parenriµhtCv2|u1D7≠6

and if |u1D7≠6 >Λ the ﬁber stress equals: 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D438|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠6 − 1) + |u1D438/u1D45:.st(|u1D7≠6 −Λ). 
In Figure M266-1  the ﬁber stress is rendered with /u1D4:B0 = 2 7.5, |u1D44J0 = 2  and 
the transition point becomes Λ= 1.1.  *.

should be used its index must be given in ACT10. No te that all variables that 
correspond to ω are neglected if a load curve is used.  The active  parameters on
