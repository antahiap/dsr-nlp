 *. CITY  *.  CITY, treats the elastic 
strains using a hyperelastic formulation.  
The LOG_INTERPOLATION keyword option interpolates t he strain rates in a table LC-
SS with logarithmic interpolation.  
The STOCHASTIC keyword option allows spatially vary ing yield and failure behavior.  
See *DEFINE_STOCHASTIC_VARIATION for additional inf ormation. 
The MIDFAIL keyword option is available for thin sh ell elements and thick shell 
formulations which use thin shell material models.  When included on the keyword 
line, this option causes failure to be checked only  at the mid-plane of the element.  If an 
element has an even number of layers, failure is ch ecked in the two layers closest to the 
mid-plane. 
The 2D keyword option is available only for shell e lements.  It invokes actual plane 
stress treatment, meaning transverse shear stresses  are not part of the yield condition 
but updated elastically.

This is  Material Type 112.  An elasto-plastic material with  an arbitrary stress versus 
strain curve and arbitrary strain rate dependency c an be deﬁned.  The elastic response 
of this model uses a ﬁnite strain formulation so th at large elastic strains can develop 
before yielding occurs.  This model is available fo r solid elements only.  See Remarks 
below.

speciﬁed (see *PART).

ETAN Tangent modulus; ignored if LCSS > 0  
C Strain rate parameter, |u1D436; see Remarks below.  
P Strain rate parameter, |u1D4JD; see Remarks below. 
LCSS Load curve ID or table ID.   
Load Curve ID.   The load curve deﬁnes eﬀective stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain.  If deﬁned, EP S1 - EPS8 and 
ES1 - ES8 are ignored.   
Table ID. The table deﬁnes for each strain rate value a load curve 
ID giving the stress as a function of eﬀective plas tic strain for that 
rate; see Figure M24-1 .  Th e stress as a function of eﬀective plastic 
strain curve for the lowest value of strain rate is  used if the strain 
rate falls below the minimum value.  Likewise, the stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain curve for the h ighest value of 
strain rat e is used if the strain rate exceeds the maximum va lue.  
The strain rate parameters, |u1D436 and |u1D4JD; the curve ID LCSR; EPS1 -
 EPS8; and ES1 - ES8 are ignored if a table ID is d eﬁned.
