 allow the Mullin’s eﬀect to be modeled, meaning aft er the ﬁrst loading and unloading, 
further reloading occurs on the unloading curve.  I f it is desired to reload on the loading 
curves with the new generalized unloading, the DAMA GE_DECAY option is available 
which allows the reloading to quickly return to the  loading curve as the damage 
parameter decays back to zero in tension and compre ssion.

EQ.0.0: Oﬀ,

Material Formulation: 
The strain is divided into two parts: a linear part  and a non-linear part of the strain  
/u1D404(|u1D461) =/u1D404|u1D43FCst(|u1D461) +/u1D404|u1D441Cst(|u1D461)  , 
and the strain rate becomes 
/u1D404̇(|u1D461) =/u1D404̇|u1D43FCst(|u1D461) +/u1D404̇|u1D441Cst(|u1D461)  , 
where /u1D404̇|u1D441Cst is an expression for the past history of /u1D404|u1D441Cst.  A postulated constitutive equation 
may be written as: 
/u1D6D4(|u1D461) =/integral.v:/˙racketleft.v2/u1D404|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst(/u1D̅0F),/u1D412(|u1D461)/˙racketright.v2∞
/u1D̅0F.st=|zeroCst|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F   , 
where /u1D412(|u1D461) is the state variable and ∫∞
/period.st/u1D̅0F.st=|zeroCstis a functional of all values of /u1D̅0F in |u1D447/u1D̅0F.st:0 ≤/u1D̅0F≤
∞ and  
/u1D404|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst(/u1D̅0F) =/u1D404|u1D441Cst(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)  , 
where /u1D̅0F is the history parameter:  
/u1D404|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst(/u1D̅0F=∞)⇔the v irgin material  . 
 
It is assumed that the material remembers only its immediate past, that is, a 
neighborhood about /u1D̅0F= 0.  Therefore, an expansion of /u1D404|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst(/u1D̅0F) in a Taylor series about 
/u1D̅0F= 0 yields: 
 
/u1D404|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst(/u1D̅0F) =/u1D404|u1D441Cst(0) +∂/u1D404|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
∂|u1D461(0)|u1D4J1|u1D461  . 
Hence, the postulated constitutive equation becomes : 
/u1D6D4(|u1D461) =/u1D6D4∗/˙racketleft.v2/u1D404|u1D441Cst(|u1D461),/u1D404̇|u1D441Cst(|u1D461),/u1D412(|u1D461)/˙racketright.v2  , 
where we have replaced |partialdiffCst/u1D404/u1D461.sts|u1D441Csts
|partialdiffCst|u1D461Cst by /u1D404̇|u1D441Cst, and /u1D6D4∗ is a function of its arguments. 
 
For a special case, 
/u1D6D4(|u1D461) =/u1D6D4∗|parenleftCv4/u1D404|u1D441Cst(|u1D461),/u1D412(|u1D461)|parenriµhtCv4  , *.   
 4.  Triaxial Loading.   Correlation under triaxial loading is achieved by  directly 
inputting the results of hydrostatic testing in add ition to the uniaxial data.  
Without this additional information which is fully optional, triaxial response 
tends to be underestimated.  See the PVID ﬁeld. 
5.  Strain Rate Averaging.   Three diﬀerent options are available.  The defaul t, 
SRAF = 0.0, uses a weighted running average with a weight of 1/12  on the 
current strain rate.  With the second option, SRAF = 1.0, the last twelve strain 
rates are averaged.  The third option, SRAF < 0, us es an exponential moving 
average with factor |SRAF|  representing the degree of weighting decrease 
(−1 ≤ SRAF < 0 ). The averaged strain rate at time |u1D461|u1D4JBCst is obtained by: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst|aCst|vCst|eCst /r.st|aCst /g.st |eCst /d.st = |SRAF||u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst+ (1 − |SRAF|)|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst|aCst|vCst|eCst /r.st|aCst /g.st |eCst /d.st  
6.  Unloading Response Options.   Several options are available to control the 
unloading response for .   *.   
 |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst= (1 − |u1D4J1)|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst
|u1D4J1 = (1 −/u1D4:B/u1D448 )
⎣⎢⎡1 − |parenleftCvJ/u1D44Acur 
/u1D44A|mCst|aCst|xCst |parenriµhtCvJS H APE 
⎦⎥⎤EXPON  
where /u1D44A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D462Cst|u1D4JFCst  corresponds to the current value of the hyperelast ic energy 
per unit undeformed volume.  The unloading response  is rate dependent 
in this case.  In some cases, this rate dependence for loading and  unloading 
can lead to noisy results.  To reduce that noise, i t is possible to switch to 
rate independent unloading with RIULD = 1. 
The LOG_LOG_INTERPOLATION  option uses log-log interpolation for 
table TBID in the strain rate direction. *. .
