Rate eﬀects can be modeled in low and medium densit y foams; see Figure M83-1 .  
Hysteretic unloading behavior in this model is a fu nction of the rate sensitivity with the 
most rate sensitive foams providing the largest hys teresis and vice versa.  The uniﬁed 
constitutive equations for foam materials by Chang [1995] provide the basis for this 
model.  The mathematical description given below is  excerpted from the reference.  
Further improvements have been incorporated based o n work by Hirth, Du Bois, and 
Weimar [1998].  Their improvements permit: load cur ves generated from a drop tower 
test to be directly input, a choice of principal or  volumetric strain rates, load curves to 
be deﬁned in tension, and the volumetric behavior t o be speciﬁed by a load curve.  
 
The unloading response was generalized by Kolling, Hirth, Erhart and Du Bois [2006] to
