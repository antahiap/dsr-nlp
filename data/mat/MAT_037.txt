Smoothing of the strain ratio /u1D̅:̅: 
*CONTROL_FORMING_STRAIN_RATIO_SMOOTH applies a smoo thing algorithm to 
reduce output noise level of the strain ratio |u1D6FD (in-plane minor strain increment/major 
strain increment) which is used to calculate the Fo rmability Index. 
Support of non-integer ﬂow potential exponent /u1D48E: 
Starting in Dev139482, non-integer value of the exp onent |u1D4JA is supported for the option 
NLP. 
Heat treatment with variable HTFLAG: 
Heat treatment for increasing the formability of pr estrained aluminum sheets can be 
simulated through the use of HTFLAG, where the inte ntion is to run a forming 
simulation in steps involving preforming, springbac k, heat treatment and postforming.  
In each step the history is transferred to the next  via the use of dynain (see *INTER-
FACE_SPRINGBACK).  The ﬁrst two steps are performed  with HTFLAG = 0 according 
to standard procedures, resulting in a plastic stra in ﬁeld |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCstcorresponding to the 
prestrain.  The heat treatment step is performed us ing HTFLAG = 1 in a coupled *.

LS-DYNA R13 2-365 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
HLCID Load curve ID expressing eﬀective yield stress as a  function of 
eﬀective plastic strain in uniaxial tension. 
IDSCALE Load curve ID expressing the scale factor for the Yo ung’s modulus 
as a function of eﬀective plastic strain.  If the E A and COE ﬁelds 
are speciﬁed, this curve is unnecessary.  This ﬁeld  is only used and 
should only be speciﬁed when the option ECHANGE is active. 
EA, COE Coeﬃcients deﬁning the Young’s modulus with respect  to the 
eﬀective plastic strain, EA is |u1D438|u1D434Cst and COE is  /u1D̅01.  If ID SCALE is 
deﬁned, these two parameters are not necessary.  In put only when 
the option ECHANGE is used.   
ICFLD ID of a load curve of the Forming Limit Diagram (FL D) under 
linear strain paths (see Remark 6 ).  In the load cu rve, abscissas 
represent minor strains while ordinates represent m ajor strains.  
Deﬁne only when the option NLP _FAILURE is active. 
STRAINLT Critical strain value at which strain aver aging is activated.  Input 
only when the option NLP_FAILURE is active.  See Remark 8 . 
Remarks: 
1.  Formulation.   Consider Cartesian reference axes which are paral lel to the three 
symmetry planes of anisotropic behavior.  Then, the  yield function suggested 
by Hill [1948] can be written as: 
|u1D439(|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst )|twoCst+ |u1D43A(|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst − |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst )|twoCst+/u1D4:B(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst )|twoCst+ 2/u1D4:F|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|threeCst |twoCst+ 2|u1D44≠|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|oneCst |twoCst+ 2/u1D441|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst |twoCst− 1
= 0 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst, and |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst are the tensile yield stresses and |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|oneCst|twoCst , |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst|threeCst , and |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst|oneCst  are 
the shear yield stresses.  The constants |u1D439, |u1D43A, /u1D4:B, /u1D4:F, |u1D44≠, and /u1D441 are related to the 
yield stress by: 
2|u1D439 =1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst|twoCst+1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst |twoCst−1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|oneCst |twoCst
2|u1D43A =1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst |twoCst+1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|oneCst |twoCst−1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst |twoCst
2/u1D4:B=1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|oneCst |twoCst+1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst |twoCst−1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst |twoCst *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-367 (MAT) |u1D44J =|u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst|twoCst |u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4JDCst  . 
It then follows that 
|u1D44J =2
|u1D43∆|twoCst− 1  . 
Using the plane stress assumption and the deﬁnition  of |u1D44J, the yield function 
may now be written as: 
|u1D439(|u1D7≠∆) = |<racketleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst |twoCst+ |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst |twoCst−2|u1D44J
|u1D44J + 1|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst + 22|u1D44J + 1
|u1D44J + 1|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst |twoCst|<racketriµhtCvJ|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2
. 
2.  Anisotropic Parameter R.   When the |u1D44J value is set to a negative value, it 
stabilizes the sheet thickness or thinning in sheet metal forming for some high 
strength types of steel or in cases where the simul ation time is long.  In Figure 
M37-1 , a comparison of thinning contours is shown on a U -channel forming 
(one-half model) using negative and positive |u1D44J values.  Maximum thinning on 
the draw wall is slight higher in the negative |u1D44J case than that in the positive |u1D44J 
case. 
3.  Comparison to other Material Models.  There are several diﬀerences 
between this model and other plasticity models for shell elements such as the 
model, .   *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-369 (MAT) Formability index (F.I) is calculated, as illustrat ed in Figure M37-2 , for every 
element in the sheet blank throughout the simulatio n duration.  The value of 
F.I. is 0.0 for virgin material and reaches maximum  of 1.0 when the material 
fails.  The theoretical background can be found in two papers: 1) T.B. Stough- 
ton, X. Zhu, “Review of Theoretical Models of the S train-Based FLD and their Rele- 
vance to the Stress-Based FLD, International Journa l of Plasticity”, V. 20, Issues 8-9, 
P. 1463-1486, 2003; and 2) Danielle Zeng, Xinhai Zh u, Laurent B. Chappuis, Z. 
Cedric Xia,  “A Path Independent Forming Limited Cr iterion for Sheet Metal Forming 
Simulations”, 2008 SAE Proceedings, Detroit MI, Apr il, 2008 .  
6.  ICFLD.   The load curve input for ICFLD follows keyword fo rmat in *DEFINE_-
CURVE, with abscissas as minor strains and ordinate s as major strains. 
ICFLD can also be speciﬁed using the *DEFINE_CURVE_ FLC keyword where 
the sheet metal thickness and strain hardening valu e are used.  Detailed usage 
information can be found in the manual entry for *D EFINE_CURVE_FLC. 
7.  Formability Index Output.   The formability index is output as a history 
variable #1 in d 3plot  ﬁles.  In addition to the F.I. values, starting in  Revision 
95599, the strain ratio |u1D6FD and eﬀective plastic strain |u1D7≠≠̅ are written to the d 3plot  
database as history variables #2 and #3, respective ly provided NEIPS on the 
second ﬁeld of the ﬁrst card of *DATABASE_EXTENT_BI NARY is set to at 
least 3.  The contour map of history variables can be plotted in LS-PrePost, 
accessible in Post /FriComp , under Misc , and by Element , under Post/History .  It 
is suggested that variable MAXINT in *DATABASE_EXTE NT_BINARY be set 
to the same value of as the NIP ﬁeld for the *SECTI ON_SHELL keyword. 
8.  STRAINLT.   By setting the STRAINLT ﬁeld strains (and strain ratios) can be 
averaged to reduce noise, which, in turn, aﬀect the  calculation of the formabil- 
ity index.  The strain STRAINLT causes the formabil ity index calculation to use 
only time averaged strains.  Reasonable STRAINLT va lues range from 5 × 10 −|threeCst 
to 10 −|twoCst.*. , and *.  .  The history variables for every element 
stored in d3plot  ﬁles include: 
1.  Formability Index (F.I.): #1 (#24 after Revision 1 13708) 
2.  Strain ratio |u1D6FD (in-plane minor strain increment/major strain incr ement): #2 (#25 
after Revision 113708) 
3.  Eﬀective strain from the planar isotropic assumptio n : #3 (#26 after Revision 
113708)
