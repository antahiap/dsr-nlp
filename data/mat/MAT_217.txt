 *MAT _OPTION TROPIC_ ELASTIC_PHASE_CHANGE  
This is  Material Type 217 a generalization of Material Type  2 for which material 
properties change on an element-by-element basis up on crossing a plane in space. 
 
This material is valid only  for shells.  The stress update is incremental and the elastic 
constants are formulated in terms of Cauchy stress and true strain.

Phases: 
The material properties for each element are initia lized using the data for the ﬁrst 
phase.  After the center of the element passes thro ugh the transition plane deﬁned by 
the two points, the material properties are irrever sibly changed to the second phase. 
 
The plane is deﬁned by two points.  The ﬁrst point,  deﬁned by the coordinates X1, Y1, 
and Z1, lies on the plane.  The second point, deﬁne d by the coordinates X2, Y2, and Z2, 
deﬁne the exterior normal as a unit vector in the d irection from the ﬁrst point to the 
second point. *.   
 Alternatively, a BETA angle can be deﬁned for indiv idual solid elements as described in 
remark 5 for *ELEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO.  The beta angle by the ORTHO option is 
available for all values of AOPT, and it overrides the BETA angle on the *MAT card for 
AOPT = 3. 
 
The directions determined by the material AOPT opti ons may be overridden for 
individual elements as described in remark 3 for *E LEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO.  
However, be aware that for materials with AOPT = 3,  the ﬁnal {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} system will be 
the system deﬁned on the element card rotated about  /u1D41C-axis by the BETA angle speciﬁed 
on the *MAT card. 
 
There are two fundamental diﬀerences between shell and solid element orthotropic 
materials.  First, the /u1D41C-direction is always normal to a shell element such  that the /u1D41A-
direction and /u1D41B-directions are within the plane of the element.  S econd, for some 
anisotropic materials, shell elements may have uniq ue ﬁber directions within each layer 
through the thickness of the element so that a laye red composite can be modeled with a 
single element. 
 
When AOPT = 0 is used in two-dimensional planar and  axisymmetric analysis, it is 
critical that the nodes in the element deﬁnition be  numbered counterclockwise for this 
option to work correctly. 
 
Because shell elements have their /u1D41C-axes deﬁned by the element normal, AOPT = 1 and 
AOPT = 4 are not available for shells.  Also, AOPT = 2 requires only the vector /u1D41A be 
deﬁned since /u1D41D is not used.  The shell procedure projects the inp utted /u1D41A-direction onto 
each element surface. 
 
Similar to solid elements, the {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} coordinate system determined by AOPT is then 
modiﬁed by a rotation about the /u1D41C-axis which we will call /u1D̅1∫.  For those materials that 
allow a unique rotation angle for each integration point through the element thickness, 
the rotation angle is calculated by 
/u1D̅1∫|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D6FD + |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst 
where |u1D6FD is a rotation for the element, and |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst is the rotation for the i’th layer of the 
element.  The |u1D6FD angle can be input using the BETA parameter on the  *MAT data, or will 
be overridden for individual elements if the BETA k eyword option for *ELEMENT_-
SHELL is used.  The |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst angles are input using the ICOMP = 1 option of *SE CTION_-
SHELL or with *PART_COMPOSITE.  If |u1D6FD or |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst is omitted, they are assumed to be zero. 
 
All anisotropic shell materials have the BETA optio n on the *MAT card available for 
both AOPT = 0 and AOPT = 3, except for materials 91  and 92 which have it available for 
all values of AOPT, 0, 2, and 3. 
 
All anisotropic shell materials allow an angle for each integration point through the 
thickness, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst, except for materials 2, 86, 91, 92, 117, 130, 170,  172, and 194.   *
