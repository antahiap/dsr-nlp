Remarks: 
1.  Failure of an Element Layer.  ERODS, the maximum eﬀective strain, controls 
the failure of an element layer.  The maximum value  of ERODS, 1, is 100% 
straining.  The layer in the element is completely removed after the maximum 
eﬀective strain (compression/tension including shea r) is reached. 
2.  Stress Limits.   The stress limits are factors used to limit the s tress in the 
softening part to a given value, 
|u1D7≠∆|mCst|iCst|nCst = SLIM|u1D46J|u1D46J × strength, 
thus, the damage value is slightly modiﬁed such tha t elastoplastic like behav- 
ior is achieved with the threshold stress.  The SLI M xx  ﬁelds may range be- 
tween 0.0 and 1.0.  With a factor of 1.0, the stres s remains at a maximum value *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-435 (MAT) shear damage is always the maximum value of the dam age from the criterion 
in the |u1D44∆ or |u1D44F-direction. 
For material model FS = -1 it is assumed that the d amage evolution is inde- 
pendent of any of the other stresses.  A coupling i s only present through the 
elastic material parameters and the complete struct ure.  In tensile and com- 
pression directions as well as in the |u1D44F-direction, diﬀerent failure surfaces can be 
assumed.  The damage values are monotonically incre asing and so a load re- 
versal from tension to compression, or compression to tension, does not result 
in a reduction of damage. 
5.  Shear Failure of Fabrics.   For fabric materials a nonlinear stress strain cu rve 
for the shear part for failure surface FS = -1 can be assumed as given below.  
This is not possible for other values of FS. 
The curve, shown in Figure M58-2  is deﬁned by three points: 
a)  the origin (0,0)  is assumed, 
b)  the limit of the ﬁrst slightly nonlinear part (mus t be input), stress (TAU1) 
and strain (GAMMA1), and 
c)  the shear strength at failure and shear strain at failure. 
In addition, a stress limiter can be used to keep t he stress constant using the 
SLIMS  ﬁeld.  This value must be positive and less than or  equal to 1.0.  It leads 
to an elastoplastic behavior for the shear part.  T he default is 10 -8, assuming 
almost brittle failure once the strength limit SC i s reached. 
6.  EC.   The EC ﬁeld is ignored when this material model i s used with thin shell 
elements.  When used with thick shell elements of f orm 1, 2, or 6, a positive EC 
value will be used to evaluate a thickness stress.  If EC is set to zero or a nega- 
tive number, then the minimum of EA and EB is used for the thickness stress 
calculation. 
7.  Strain Rate.  For any property speciﬁed to be strain-rate-depende nt, the 
smoothed, direction-appropriate strain rate is used .  For example, strain rate in 
the |u1D44∆-direction is used when assessing properties in the  |u1D44∆-direction.  The eﬀec- 
tive strain rate, however, is used when assessing t he rate-dependence of 
ERODS for load curve LCEFS.*. .
