  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
Y Hardening parameter appearing in Yoshida & Uemori’s  
equations. 
SC1 The lowercase /u1D450|twoCst deﬁned in Yoshida & Uemori’s equat ions.  Note 
the equation below from the paper: 
/u1D450=

/u1D450|twoCstmax(|u1D6F+̅∗) < |u1D43J −/u1D44C
otherwise  
See more details in About SC1 and SC2 in the remarks section.

equations. 
RSAT Hardening parameter, |u1D44Jsat , appearing in Yoshida & Uemori’s 
equations. 
SB The lowercase |u1D44F appearing in Yoshida & Uemori’s equations. 
H Anisotropic parameter associated with work- hardening 
stagnation. 
SC2 The lowercase /u1D450|oneCst deﬁned in the Yoshida and Uem ori’s equations.  
Note the equation below from the paper: 
/u1D450=
⎩|<raceleftCex|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex|<raceleftCex⎧/u1D450|oneCst
/u1D450|twoCstmax(|u1D6F+̅∗) < |u1D43J −/u1D44C
otherwise  
See more details in About SC1 and SC2 in the remarks section.  If 
SC2 equals 0.0, is left blank, or equals SC1, then it turns into the 
basic model (the one /u1D450 model).  SC2 is available for solids in 
Revision 142716. 
EA Variable controlling the change of Young’s modulus,  |u1D438|u1D434Cst in the 
following equations. 
COE Variable controlling the change of Young’s modu lus, /u1D̅01 in the 
following equations. 
IOPT Modiﬁed kinematic hardening rule ﬂag: 
EQ.0: Original Yoshida & Uemori formulation, 
EQ.1:  Modiﬁed formulation.  Deﬁne C1, C2 below. *.   
 The change in Young’s modulus is deﬁned as a functi on of eﬀective plastic strain, 
|u1D438 = |u1D438|zeroCst− (|u1D438|zeroCst− |u1D438|u1D434Cst)|<racketleftCv11 − exp|parenleftCv1−/u1D̅01|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1|<racketriµhtCv1  . 
About SC1 and SC2: 
In Yoshida and Uemori’s paper, the material paramet er /u1D450 which controls the rate of the 
kinematic hardening is modiﬁed to describe more acc urately the forward and reverse 
deformations of the cyclic plasticity curve in the vicinity of the initial yield.  The 
parameter /u1D450 is modiﬁed as: |u1D43J+|u1D44J /u1D44C 
|u1D6F+ |u1D6FD |u1D6F+∗ |u1D7≠∆ |u1D7≠∆−|u1D6F+ |u1D437|u1D4JDCst 
/u1D442 Yield Surface  Bounding Surface  
Figure M125-1.   Schematic illustration of the two-surface model. /u1D442 is the 
original center of the yield surface; |u1D6F+∗ is the current center for the yield surface; 
|u1D6F+ is the center of the bounding surface; and |u1D6FD represents the relative position of 
the centers of the two surfaces. /u1D44C is the size of the yield surface and is constant 
throughout the deformation process.  |u1D43J + |u1D44J  represents the size of the bounding 
surface, with |u1D44J being associated with isotropic hardening. Reproduced from 
Yoshida and Uemori’s original paper . *.
