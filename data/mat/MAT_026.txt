AOPT Material axes option (see MAT _OPTION TROPIC_ELASTIC for a 
more complete description): 
EQ.0.0: locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes 1, 2, and 4, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_NODES. 
EQ.1.0: locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y a 
point in space and the global location of the eleme nt 
center; this is the |u1D44∆-direction. 
EQ.2.0: globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR 
EQ.3.0: locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-259 (MAT) The load curves deﬁne the magnitude of the average stress as the material 
changes density (relative volume); see Figure M26-1 . There are two ways to 
deﬁne these curves, (1) as a function of relative v olume, |u1D449, or (2)  as a function 
of volumetric strain deﬁned as: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D449Cst= 1 − |u1D449  . 
In the former case, the ﬁrst value in the curve sho uld correspond to a value of 
relative volume slightly less than the fully compac ted value.  In the latter, the 
ﬁrst value in the curve should be less than or equa l to zero, corresponding to 
tension, and increase to full compaction. Care should be taken when deﬁning the 
curves so that extrapolated values do not lead to n egative yield stresses. 
2.  Elastic/Shear Moduli during Compaction.   The behavior before compaction 
is orthotropic where the components of the stress t ensor are uncoupled, mean- 
ing an |u1D44∆ component of strain will generate resistance in th e local |u1D44∆-direction 
with no coupling to the local |u1D44F and /u1D450 directions.  The elastic moduli vary, from 
their initial values to the fully compacted values at |u1D449/u1D45:.st, linearly with the rela- 
tive volume |u1D449: 0Curve extends into negative volumetric 
strain quadrant since LS-DYNA will 
extrapolate using the two end points. It 
is important that the extropolation 
does not extend into the negative 
unloading and
reloading path
Unloading is based on the interpolated Young’s 
moduli which must provide an unloading tangent 
that exceeds the loading tangent. σij

Figure M26-1.  Stress quantity versus volumetric strain. Note that the “yield 
stress” at a volumetric strain of zero is non- zero.  In the load curve deﬁnition, 
see *DEFINE_ CURVE, the “time” value is the volumetric strain and the 
“function” value is the yield stress. *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-261 (MAT) |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst (|u1D449)|u1D7≠6|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial

The stress components are found using the curves de ﬁned on Card 2.  The pa- 
rameter |u1D7≠6 is either unity or a value taken from the load cur ve number, LCSR, 
that deﬁnes |u1D7≠6 as a function of strain-rate.  Strain-rate is deﬁn ed here as the 
Euclidean norm of the deviatoric strain-rate tensor . 
For fully compacted material it is assumed that the  material behavior is elastic-
perfectly plastic and the stress components updated  according to: 
|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst trial = |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+ 2|u1D43A∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D451.st |u1D4J2Cst|u1D463Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst
|twoCst/fraction.v2  , 
where the deviatoric strain increment is deﬁned as 
∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst de v = ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst −1
3∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   . 
Now a check is made to see if the yield stress for the fully compacted material 
is exceeded by comparing the eﬀective trial stress,  
|u1D46≠eff trial = |parenleftCvJ3
2|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst trial |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst trial |parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2
  ,   
to the deﬁned yield stress, SIGY.  If the eﬀective trial stress exceeds the yield 
stress the stress components are simply scaled back  to the yield surface 
|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst=|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst
|u1D46≠eff trial |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst trial . 
Now the pressure is updated using the elastic bulk modulus, |u1D43∆, 
|u1D4JD|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D4JD|u1D4JBCst− |u1D43∆∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2 
where  
|u1D43∆ =|u1D438
3(1 − 2|u1D463) 
to obtain the ﬁnal value for the Cauchy stress 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst− |u1D4JD|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   . 
After completing the stress the stresses are transf ormed back to the global con- 
ﬁguration. 
4.  Failure.   For *CONSTRAINED_TIED_NODES_WITH_FAILURE, the fai lure is 
based on the volume strain instead to the plastic s train. *
