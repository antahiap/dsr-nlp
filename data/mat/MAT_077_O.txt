  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
RO Mass density 
PR Poisson’s ratio ( ≥ .49 is recommended; smaller values may not 
work and should not be used).  If this is set to a negative number, 
then the absolute value is used, and an extra card is read for 
Mullins eﬀect. 
N Order of ﬁt to curve LCID1 for the Ogden model, ( currently < 9, 2 
generally works okay).  The constants generated dur ing the ﬁt are 
printed in d3hsp and can be directly input in futur e runs, ther eby, 
saving the cost of performing the nonlinear ﬁt.  Th e goodness of 
the ﬁt can be visually evaluated by plotting data i n the output ﬁle 
curveplot*  using LS-PrePost (click  XYplot  → Add  to read the 
curveplot*  ﬁle). 
NV Number of Prony series terms for ﬁtting curve LCID2 .  If zero, the 
default is 6.  Currently, the maximum number is set  to 12.  Values 
less than 12, possibly 3 – 5, are recommended, since each term 
used adds signiﬁcantly to the cost.  Caution should  be ex ercised 
when taking the results from the ﬁt.  Preferably, a ll generated 
coeﬃcients should be positive.  Negative values may  lead to 
unstable results.  Once a satisfactory ﬁt has been achieved, it is 
recommended that the coeﬃcients which are written i nto the 
output ﬁle be input in future runs. 
G Shear modulus for frequency independent damping.  F requency 
independent damping is based on a spring and slider  in series.  
The critical stress for the slider mechanism is SIG F deﬁned below.  
For the best results, the value of G should be 250 - 1000 times 
greater than SIGF.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCID2 Load curve ID of the deviatoric stress relaxation c urve, neglecting 
the long term deviatoric stress.  If LCID2 is given , constants |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst
and |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst are determined using a least squares ﬁt.  See M76-1  for an 
example relaxation curve.  The ordinate of the curv e is the 
viscoelastic deviatoric stress divided by the quant ity 2 times the 
constant value of deviatoric strain where the stres s and strain are 
in the direction of the prescribed strain.  If in n on-directional 
terms, it is the eﬀective stress divided by the qua ntity 3 times the 
eﬀective strain. 
BSTART In the ﬁt, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst  is set to zero, |u1D6FD|twoCst  is set to BSTART, |u1D6FD|threeCst is 10 times |u1D6FD|twoCst, 
|u1D6FD|fourCst is 10 times |u1D6FD|threeCst, and so on.  If zero, BSTART is determined by an 
iterative trial and error scheme.

where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) and |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) are the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent stre ss 
measures.  This stress is added to the stress tenso r determined from the strain energy 
functional. 
 
If we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, the relaxation function is represented by 
six terms from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st |u1D461Cst |u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
given by, 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts|u1D461Cst|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a dampers and springs in 
series.  We characterize this in the input by shear  moduli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6, and decay constants,  |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.  
The viscoelastic behavior is optional, and an arbit rary number of terms may be used.  In 
order to avoid a constant shear modulus from this v iscoelastic formulation, a term in 
the series is included only when  |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst> 0. 
 
For VFLAG = 1, the viscoelastic term is 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D461Cst

∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F  
where |u1D7≠∆/u1D458/u1D45∫|u1D438 is the instantaneous stress evaluated from the int ernal energy functional.  The 
coeﬃcients in the Prony series therefore correspond  to normalized relaxation moduli 
instead of elastic moduli. 
 
The Mooney-Rivlin rubber model (model 27) is obtain ed by specifying |u1D4JB = 1 .  In spite of 
the diﬀerences in formulations with Model 27, we ﬁn d that the results obtained with 
this model are nearly identical with those of Mater ial 27 as long as large values of 
Poisson’s ratio are used. 
 
The frequency independent damping is obtained by th e having a spring and slider in 
series as shown in the following sketch:
