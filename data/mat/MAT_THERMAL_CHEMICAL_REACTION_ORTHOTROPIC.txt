LS-DYNA R13 1-1 (EOS) *EOS  
 
When deﬁning an equation of state, the type of equa tion of state is speciﬁed by a 
corresponding 3-digit number in the command name, e .g., *EOS_004, or equivalently, 
by it’s more descriptive designation, e.g., *EOS_GR UNEISEN.  The equations of state 
can be used with a subset of the materials that are  available for solid elements; see the 
MATERIAL MODEL REFERENCE TABLES in the beginning of  the *MAT section of 
this Manual.   *EOS_015 is linked to the type 2 thi ck shell element and can be used to 
model engine gaskets. 
 
The meaning associated with particular extra histor y variables for a subset of material 
models and equations of state are  tabulated at http://www.dynasupport.com/howtos-
/material/history-variables .  The ﬁrst three extra history variables when usin g an 
equation of state are (1) internal energy, (2) pres sure due to bulk viscosity, and (3) the 
element volume from the previous time step.

An additional option TITLE may be appended to all the *EOS keywords.  If this option 
is used then an additional line is read for each se ction in 80a format which can be used 
to describe the equation of state.  At present LS-D YNA does not make use of the title.  
Inclusion of title simply gives greater clarity to input decks.  
Deﬁnitions and Conventions 
In order to prescribe the boundary and/or initial t hermodynamic condition, manual 
computations are often necessary.  Conventions or d eﬁnitions must be established to 
simplify this process.  Some basic variables are de ﬁned in the following.  Since many of 
these variables have already been denoted by diﬀere nt symbols, the notations used here 
are unique in this section only!  They are presente d to only clarify their usage.  A 
corresponding SI unit set is also presented as an e xample. 
First consider a few volumetric parameters since th ey are a measure of compression (or 
expansion). 
Volume: 
|u1D449 ≈ (m|threeCst) 
Mass: 
|u1D44≠ ≈ (Kg) 
Current speciﬁc volume (per mass): 
|u1D71≠ =|u1D449
|u1D44≠=1
|u1D7≠+≈ |parenleftCv6|u1D4JA|threeCst
Kg |parenriµhtCv6 
Reference speciﬁc volume: 
|u1D71≠|zeroCst=|u1D449|zeroCst
|u1D44≠=1
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst≈ |parenleftCv6|u1D4JA|threeCst
Kg |parenriµhtCv6 
Relative volume: 
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst=|u1D449
|u1D449|zeroCst=(|u1D449 |u1D44≠ ⁄ )
(|u1D449|zeroCst|u1D44≠ ⁄ )=|u1D71≠
|u1D71≠|zeroCst=|u1D7≠+|zeroCst
|u1D7≠+ 
Current normalized volume increment:  *EOS 
LS-DYNA R13 1-3 (EOS) |u1D4J1|u1D71≠ 
|u1D71≠=|u1D71≠ − |u1D71≠|zeroCst
|u1D71≠= 1 −1
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst= 1 −|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst 
A frequently used volumetric parameter is: 
|u1D7≠7 =1
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst− 1 =|u1D71≠|zeroCst− |u1D71≠
|u1D71≠= −|u1D4J1|u1D71≠ 
|u1D71≠=|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst− 1 
Sometimes another volumetric parameter is used: 
|u1D7≠2 =|u1D71≠|zeroCst
|u1D71≠=|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst 
Thus, the relation between |u1D7≠7 and |u1D7≠2  is, 
|u1D7≠7 =|u1D71≠|zeroCst− |u1D71≠
|u1D71≠= |u1D7≠2 − 1 
The following table summarizes these volumetric par ameters. 
VARIABLES COMPRESSION NO LOAD EXPANSION

|u1D7≠7=1
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst−1=|u1D7≠2−1 > 0 0 < 0 
V0 – Initial Relative Volume 
There are 3 deﬁnitions of density that must be dist inguished from each other: 
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst= |u1D7≠+ref  
= Density at nominal reference ⁄ state, usually non-stre ss or non-deformed state. 
|u1D7≠+|dividesCv1|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst= Density at time 0 
|u1D7≠+ = Current density 
 
Recalling the current relative volume 
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst=|u1D7≠+|zeroCst
|u1D7≠+=|u1D71≠
|u1D71≠|zeroCst, 
at time = 0 the relative volume is 
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst= |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst=|u1D7≠+|zeroCst
|u1D7≠+|dividesCv1|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst=|u1D71≠||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst
|u1D71≠|zeroCst. *EOS   
1-4 (EOS) LS-DYNA R13 Generally, the V0 input parameter in an *EOS card r efers to this |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst.  |u1D7≠+|zeroCst is generally the 
density deﬁned in the *MAT card.  Hence, if a mater ial is mechanically compressed at 
t = 0, V0, or |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst, the initial relative volume, may be computed and i nput accordingly 
(|u1D71≠|zeroCst≠ |u1D4490 ). 
 
The “reference” state is a unique state with respec t to which the material stress tensor is 
computed.  Therefore |u1D71≠|zeroCst is very critical in computing the pressure level i n a material.  
Incorrect choice of |u1D71≠|zeroCst would lead to incorrect pressure computed.  In gen eral, |u1D71≠|zeroCst is 
chosen such that at zero compression or expansion, the material should be in 
equilibrium with its ambient surrounding.  In many of the equations shown in the EOS 
section, |u1D7≠7 is frequently used as a measure of compression (or  expansion).  However, the 
users must clearly distinguish between |u1D7≠7 and |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst. 
E0 – Internal Energy 
Internal energy represents the thermal energy state  (temperature dependent 
component) of a system.  One deﬁnition for internal  energy is 
|u1D438 = |u1D44≠|u1D436|u1D463Cst|u1D447 ≈ (Joule) 
Note that the capital “ |u1D438” here is the absolute internal energy.  It is not the same as that 
used in the subsequent *EOS keyword input, or some equations shown for each *EOS 
card.  This internal energy is often deﬁned with re spect to a mass or volume unit. 
 
Internal energy per unit mass (also called speciﬁc internal energy): 
|u1D4J2 =|u1D438
|u1D44≠= |u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D447 ≈ |parenleftCvJJoule 
Kg |parenriµhtCvJ 
Internal energy per unit current volume:  
|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst=|u1D44≠
|u1D449|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D447 = |u1D7≠+|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D447 =|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D447
|u1D71≠≈ |parenleftCvJJoule 
m3=N
m2|parenriµhtCvJ 
Internal energy per unit reference volume: 
|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts=|u1D44≠
|u1D449|zeroCst|u1D436|u1D463Cst|u1D447 = |u1D7≠+|zeroCst|u1D436|u1D463Cst|u1D447 =|u1D436|u1D463Cst|u1D447
|u1D71≠|zeroCst≈ |parenleftCvJJoule 
m3=N
m2|parenriµhtCvJ 
|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts typically refers to the capital “E” shown in some equations under this “EOS” 
section.  Hence the initial “ internal energy per unit reference volume ”, E0, a keyword input 
parameter in the *EOS section can be computed from 
|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts|dividesCv2|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst= |u1D7≠+|zeroCst|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D447||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst 
To convert from |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCst to |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst, simply divide |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCst by |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst 
|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst= |u1D7≠+|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D447 = |<racketleftCv1|u1D7≠+|zeroCst|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D447|<racketriµhtCv1|u1D7≠+

LS-DYNA R13 1-5 (EOS) Equations of States (EOS) 
A thermodynamic state of a homogeneous material, no t undergoing any chemical 
reactions or phase changes, may be deﬁned by two st ate variables.  This relation is 
generally called an equation of state.  For example , a few possible forms relating 
pressure to two other state variables are 
|u1D443 = |u1D443(|u1D7≠+, |u1D447) = |u1D443(|u1D71≠, |u1D4J2) = |u1D443(|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst, |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst) = |u1D443(|u1D7≠7, |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts) 
The last equation form is frequently used to comput e pressure.  The EOS for solid phase 
materials is sometimes partitioned into 2 terms, a cold pressure and a thermal pressure  
|u1D443 = |u1D443|u1D4J≠Cst(|u1D7≠7) + |u1D443|u1D447Cst(|u1D7≠7, |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts) 
|u1D443|u1D4J≠Cst(|u1D7≠7) is the cold pressure hypothetically evaluated alon g a 0-degree-Kelvin isotherm.  
This is sometimes called a 0-K pressure-volume rela tion or cold compression curve.  
|u1D443|u1D447Cst(|u1D7≠7, |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts) is the thermal pressure component that depends on both volumetric 
compression and thermal state of the material.  
 
Diﬀerent forms of the EOS describe diﬀerent types o f materials and how their 
volumetric compression (or expansion) behaviors.  T he coeﬃcients for each EOS model 
come from data-ﬁtting, phenomenological description s, or derivations based on 
classical thermodynamics, etc.  
Linear Compression 
In low pressure processes, pressure is not signiﬁca ntly aﬀected by temperature.  When 
volumetric compression is within an elastic linear deformation range, a linear bulk 
modulus may be used to relate volume changes to pre ssure changes.  Recalling the 
deﬁnition of an isotropic bulk modulus is [Fung 196 5], 
∆|u1D71≠
|u1D71≠= −|u1D443
|u1D43∆. 
This may be rewritten as 
|u1D443 = |u1D43∆ |<racketleftCvJ−∆|u1D71≠
|u1D71≠|<racketriµhtCvJ= |u1D43∆|u1D7≠7. 
The bulk modulus, |u1D43∆, thus is equivalent to |u1D436|oneCst in *EOS_LINEAR_POLYNOMIAL when 
all other coeﬃcients are zero.  This is a simplest form of an EOS.  To initialize a pressure 
for such a material, only |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst must be deﬁned.  
Initial Conditions 
In general, a thermodynamic state must be deﬁned by  two state variables.  The need to 
specify |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst and/or |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts|dividesCv2|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst depends on the form of the EOS chosen.  The user s hould 
review the equation term-by-term to establish what parameters to be initialized. *EOS   
1-6 (EOS) LS-DYNA R13 For many of the EOS available, pressure is speciﬁed  (given), and the user must make an 
assumption on either |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts|dividesCv2|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst or |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst.  Consider two possibilities (1) |u1D447||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst is deﬁned or 
assumed from which |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts|dividesCv2|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst may be computed, or (2) |u1D7≠+|dividesCv1|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst is deﬁned or assumed from 
which |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst may be obtained. 
When to Use EOS 
For small strains considerations, a total stress te nsor may be partitioned into a 
deviatoric stress component and a mechanical pressu re. 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst+|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst 
3|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst− |u1D443|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
|u1D443 = −|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst 
3 
The pressure component may be written from the diag onal stress components. 
 
Note that |u1D7≠∆Cst|u1D4J8Csts|u1D4J8Csts 
|threeCst=[|u1D7≠∆Cst|oneCsts|oneCsts +|u1D7≠∆Cst|twoCsts|twoCsts +|u1D7≠∆Cst|threeCsts|threeCsts ]
|threeCst is positive in tension while P is positive in comp ression.   
 
Similarly, the total strain tensor may be partition ed into a deviatoric strain component 
(volume-preserving deformation) and a volumetric de formation. 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst= |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst+|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst 
3|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
where |u1D7≠≠Cst|u1D4J8Csts|u1D4J8Csts 
|threeCst is called the mean normal strain, and |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst  is called the dilatation or volume 
strain (change in volume per unit initial volume) 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst =|u1D449 − |u1D449|zeroCst
|u1D449|zeroCst 
Roughly speaking, a typical convention may refer to  the relation |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|minuteCst= |u1D4J3 (|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst) as a 
“constitutive equation”, and |u1D443 = |u1D4J3 (|u1D7≠7, |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts) as an EOS.  The use of an EOS may be 
omitted only when volumetric deformation is very sm all, and ||u1D443| ≪ |dividesCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst|dividesCv2. 
A Note About Contact When Using an Equation of Stat e 
When a part includes an equation of state, it is im portant that the initial geometry of 
that part not be perturbed by the contact algorithm .  Such perturbation can arise due to 
initial penetrations in the contact surfaces but ca n usually be avoided by setting the 
variable IGNORE to 1 or 2 in the *CONTACT input or by using a segment based contact
