HEAT Switch to activate the heating algorithms (see 
Remarks 7  and 8): 
EQ.0: Heating is not activated which means 
that no transformation to austenite is 
possible. 
EQ.1: Heating is activated which means 
that only transformation to austenite 
is possible. 
EQ.2: Automatic switching between cooling 
and heating.  LS-DYNA checks the 
temperature gradient and calls the 
appropriate algorithms.  For example, 
this can be used to simulate the heat 
aﬀected zone during welding. 
LT.0: The switch between cooling and 
heating is deﬁned by a time depend- 
ent load curve with ID = |H EAT| . The 
ordinate should be 1.0 when heating 
is applied and 0.0 if cooling is prefer- 
able.

where the element weight values are input on Cards 2 through 4. 
 
The automatic start temperatures are printed to the  messag  ﬁle and if they are not 
accurate enough you can manually set them in the in put deck (must be set in absolute 
temperature, Kelvin).  If HEAT > 0, the temperature  FSnc (ferrite without C) is also 
echoed.  If the specimen exceeds that temperature, all remaining ferrite is instantane- 
ously transformed to austenite.

 8.  HEAT, Grain Growth, and Re-austenization.   When HEAT is activated the 
re-austenitization and grain growth algorithms are also activated.  The grain 
growth is activated when the temperature exceeds a threshold value that is 
given by  
|u1D447 =|u1D43J
|u1D434 − log |oneCst|zeroCst |<racketleftCv1(GRCM)|u1D44∆Cst(GRCC)|u1D44FCst|<racketriµhtCv1  ,

|u1D44JCst|u1D447Cst   .

are calibrated in Oddy to 2.06 × 10 /eight.st and 4.806 respectively.  Note that /u1D̅0F above

We detect the holding phase for Bainite and Martens ite when the temperature 
is in the appropriate range and if average temperat ure rate is below DTCRIT.

13.  CWM (Welding).   When computational welding mechanics is activated  with 
CWM = 1, the material can be deﬁned to be initially  in a quiet state.  In this 
state the material (often referred to as ghost mate rial) has thermo-mechanical 
properties deﬁned by an additional card.  The mater ial is activated when the 
temperature reaches the birth temperature.  See MAT _CWM (.   *. . They are pro- 
vided to give reasonable starting results.  These 
values may not reproduce the results from the

10.  Phase Indexed Tables.   When using a table ID to describe the Young’s 
modulus as dependent on the temperature, use *DEFIN E_TABLE_2D.  Set the 
abscissa value equal to 1 for the austenite YM-curv e, equal to 2 for the ferrite 
YM-curve, equal to 3 for the pearlite YM curve, equ al to 4 for the bainite YM-
curve and ﬁnally equal to 5 for the martensite YM-c urve.  When using the 
PHASE option only the curves for the included phase s are required, but all ﬁve 
phases may be included.  The total YM is calculated  by a linear mixture law:
