This is  Material Type 155.  An isotropic elastic-plastic ma terial where unique yield 
stress as a function of plastic strain curves can b e deﬁned for compression and tension.  
Also, failure can occur based on a plastic strain o r a minimum time step size.  Rate 
eﬀects on the yield stress are modeled either by us ing the Cowper-Symonds strain rate 
model or by using two load curves that scale the yi eld stress values in compression and 
tension, respectively.  Material rate eﬀects, which  are independent of the plasticity 
model, are based on a 6-term Prony series Maxwell m ode that generates an additional 
stress tensor.  The viscous stress tensor is superi mposed on the stress tensor generated 
by the plasticity.  Pressure is deﬁned by an equati on of state, which is required to utilize 
this model.  This model is applicable to solid elem ents and SPH.

FAIL Failure ﬂag: 
LT.0.0: User deﬁned failure subroutine, matusr_24  in 
dyn21.F , is called to determine failure 
EQ.0.0: Failure is not considered.  This option is recommen ded 
if failure is not of interest since many calculatio ns will 
be saved. 
GT.0.0: Plastic strain to failure.  When the plastic strain  reaches 
this value, the element is deleted from the calcula tion.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
PC Compressive mean stress at which the yield stress f ollows load 
curve ID LCIDC.  If the pressure falls between PC a nd PT, a 
weighted average of the two load curves is used.   
PT Tensile mean stress at which the yield stress follo ws load curve 
ID LCIDT. 
PCUTC Pressure cut-oﬀ in compression.  When the pre ssure cut- oﬀ is 
reached, the deviatoric stress tensor is set to zer o.  The 
compressive pressure is not, however, limited to PC UTC.  Like 
the yield stress, PCUTC is scaled to account for ra te eﬀects. 
PCUTT Pressure cut-oﬀ in tension.  When the pressur e cut- oﬀ is reached, 
the deviatoric stress tensor and tensile pressure i s set to zero.  
Like the yield stress, PCUTT is scaled to account f or rate eﬀects. 
PCUTF Pressure cut-oﬀ ﬂag: 
EQ.0.0: inactive 
EQ.1.0: active 
SCALEP Scale factor applied to the yield stress aft er the pressure cut- oﬀ is 
reached in either compression or tension.  If SCALE P = 0.0 
(default), the deviatoric stress is set to zero aft er the cut- oﬀ is 
reached. 
SCALEE Scale fa ctor applied to the yield stress after the strain e xceeds the 
failure strain set by FAIL.  If SCALEE = 0.0 (default), the 
deviatoric strain is set to zero if the failure str ain is exceeded.  If 
both SCALEP > 0 and SCALEE > 0 and both failure con ditions are met, 
then the minimum scale factor is used.
