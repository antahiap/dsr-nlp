*. -PARAMETER_BARLAT [2,3a] {36} 
 *. -PARAMETER_BARLAT  *. -PARAMETER_BARLA T is a version of this 
material model that includes a ﬂow limit diagram fa ilure option.  
Available options include:

NLP 
The NLP option estimates failure using the Formabil ity Index (F.I.), which accounts for 
the non-linear strain paths seen in metal forming a pplications (see the Remarks ).  The 
NLP ﬁeld in Card 4b must  be deﬁned when using this option.  The NLP option is also 
available for *. -PARAMETER_BARLAT

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
P2 Material parameter: 
HR.EQ.1.0: Yield stress 
HR.EQ.2.0: |u1D4JB, exponent for Swift exponential hardening 
HR.EQ.4.0: /u1D450, coeﬃcient for Voce exponential hardening 
HR.EQ.5.0: |u1D4JB, exponent for Gosh exponential hardening 
HR.EQ.6.0: /u1D450, coeﬃcient for Hocket- Sherby exponential 
hardening 
ITER Iteration ﬂag for speed: 
ITER.EQ.0.0: fully iterative 
ITER.EQ.1.0: ﬁxed at three iterations 
Generally, ITER = 0 is recommended.  However, ITER = 1 is 
somewhat faster and may give acceptable results in most 
problems.

HR.EQ.5.0: |u1D7≠≠|zeroCst for determining initial yield stress for Gosh 
exponential hardening.  (Default = 0.0)

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
FLDCID Load curve ID deﬁning the Forming Limit Diagram.  M inor 
engineering strains in percent are deﬁned as abscis sa values and 
Major engineering strains in percent are deﬁn ed as ordinate 
values.  The forming limit diagram is shown in Figure M39-1 .  In 
deﬁning the curve list pairs of minor and major str ains starting 
with the left most point and ending with the right most point, see 
*DEFINE_CURVE. 
RN Hardening exponent equivalent to the n- value in a power law 
hardening law.  If the parameter FLD CID is not deﬁned, this 
value in combination with the value RT can be used to calculate a 
forming limit curve to allow for failure. 
RT Sheet thickness used for calculating a forming limi t curve.  This 
value does not override the sheet thickness in any way.  It is only 
used in conjunction with the parameter RN to calcul ate a forming 
limit curve if the parameter FLDCID is not deﬁned.   
FLDSAFE A safety oﬀset of the forming limit curve.  This va lue should be 
input as a percentage (ex.  10 not 0.10).  This saf ety margin will be 
applied to the forming limit curve deﬁned by FLD CID or the 
curve calculated by RN and RT. 
FLDNIPF Numerical integration points failure treatment. 
GT.0.0: The number of element integration points that must fail 
before  the element is deleted.  By default, if one  inte- 
gration point has strains above the forming limit c urve, 
the element is ﬂagged for deletion. 
LT.0.0: The element is deleted when all integration points 
within a relative distance of – FLDNIPF from the mid 
surface have failed (value between -1.0 and 0.0).
