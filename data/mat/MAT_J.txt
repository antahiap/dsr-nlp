This is  Material Type 15.  The Johnson/Cook strain and temp erature sensitive plasticity 
is sometimes used for problems where the strain rat es vary over a large range and 
adiabatic temperature increases due to plastic heat ing cause material softening.  When 
used with solid elements, this model requires an eq uation-of-state.  If thermal eﬀects 
and damage are unimportant, we recommend the much l ess expensive *. OHNSON_COOK

EQ.2.0:  For solid elements |u1D7≠∆max ≥ −PC  resets tensile stresses to 
zero.  Compressive stress are still allowed. 
EQ.3.0:  For solid elements |u1D4JD < PC  resets the pressure to zero 
thereby disallowing tensile pressure.

elements only since it is always necessary to itera te for the shell

NUMINT Number of through thickness integration points whic h must fail 
before the shell element is deleted.  If zero, all integ ration points 
must fail (the default).  Since nodal ﬁber rotation s limit strains at 
active integration points, we do not recommend the default 
because elements undergoing large strain are often not deleted 
using this criterion.  Better results may be obtain ed when NU-
MINT is set to 1 or a number less than one half of the number of 
through thickness points.  For example, if four thr ough thickness 
points are used, NU MINT should not exceed 2, even for fully 
integrated shells which have 16 integration points.

|u1D447melt − |u1D447room  
The quantity |u1D447 − |u1D447room  is stored as extra history variable 5.  In the cas e of a 
mechanical-only analysis, this is the adiabatic tem perature increase calculated 
as  
|u1D447 − |u1D447room =internal energy

where 
|u1D436|u1D4JDCst and |u1D7≠+ =  input constants 
|u1D449 /u1D45C=  initial v olume 
In a coupled thermal/mechanical analysis, |u1D447 − |u1D447room  includes heat- 
ing/cooling from all sources, not just adiabatic he ating from the internal ener- 
gy. 
Constants for a variety of materials are provided i n Johnson and Cook [1983].  
A fully viscoplastic formulation is optional (VP) w hich incorporates the rate 
equations within the yield surface.  An additional cost is incurred, but the im- 
provement in the results can be dramatic. 
Due to nonlinearity in the dependence of ﬂow stress  on plastic strain, an accu- 
rate value of the ﬂow stress requires iteration for  the increment in plastic 
strain.  However, by using a Taylor series expansio n with linearization about 
the current time, we can solve for |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst with suﬃcient accuracy to avoid iteration. 
2.  Strain at Fracture.  The strain at fracture is given by 
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st= max|parenleftCv1|<racketleftCv1|u1D437|oneCst+ |u1D437|twoCstexp|u1D437|threeCst|u1D7≠∆∗|<racketriµhtCv1[1 + |u1D437|fourCstln|u1D7≠≠̇∗][1 + |u1D437|fiveCst|u1D447∗], EFMIN|parenriµhtCv1  , 
where |u1D7≠∆∗ is the ratio of pressure divided by eﬀective stres s 
|u1D7≠∆∗=|u1D4JD
|u1D7≠∆eff    . 
Fracture occurs when the damage parameter, 
|u1D437 =∑∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st  , 
reaches the value of 1.  |u1D437 is stored as extra history variable 4 in shell ele ments 
and extra history variable 6 in solid elements. 
3.  Spall Models.   A choice of three spall models is oﬀered to repre sent material 
splitting, cracking, and failure under tensile load s:  
a)  Pressure Limit Model.   The pressure limit model limits the minimum hy- 
drostatic pressure to the speciﬁed value, |u1D4JD ≥ |u1D4JDmin .  If the calculated pres- 
sure is more tensile than this limit, the pressure is reset to |u1D4JDmin .  This *. OHNSON_COOK

 strain rate by the reference strain rate deﬁned in the input.  In this equation |u1D44∆ is the 
intact normalized strength parameter, /u1D450 is the strength parameter for strain rate 
dependence, |u1D7≠≠̇∗ is the normalized plastic strain rate, and

In the above, |u1D447 is the maximum tensile pressure strength, PHEL  is the pressure

|u1D437 = |summationCv1∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst 
represents the accumulated damage (history variable  2) based upon the increase in 
plastic strain per computational cycle and the plas tic strain to fracture

represents the damaged behavior.  The parameter |u1D4J1|oneCst controls the rate at which damage 
accumulates.  If it is set to 0, full damage occurs  in one time step, that is, instantaneous- 
ly.  It is also the best parameter to vary when att empting to reproduce results generated 
by another ﬁnite element program. 
 
In undamaged material, the hydrostatic pressure is given by 
|u1D443 =/u1D458|oneCst|u1D7≠7 +/u1D458|twoCst|u1D7≠7|twoCst+/u1D458|threeCst|u1D7≠7|threeCst 
in compression and 
|u1D443 =/u1D458|oneCst|u1D7≠7 
in tension where |u1D7≠7 = |u1D7≠+ |u1D7≠+|zeroCst− 1 ⁄.  When damage starts to occur, there is an increas e in 
pressure.  A fraction, between 0 and 1, of the elas tic energy loss, |u1D6FD, is converted into 
hydrostatic potential energy (pressure).  The detai ls of this pressure increase are given 
in the reference.

 where |u1D7≠∆ is the actual equivalent stress, and |u1D4J3/c.st|minuteCst is the quasi-static uniaxial compressive 
strength.  The expression is deﬁned as:

where |u1D437 is the damage parameter, |u1D443∗= |u1D443 |u1D4J3/c.st|minuteCst⁄ is the normalized pressure and |u1D7≠≠̇∗= |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D7≠≠̇|zeroCst⁄ is 
the dimensionless strain rate.  The model increment ally accumulates damage, |u1D437, both 
from equivalent plastic strain and plastic volumetr ic strain, and is expressed as 
|u1D437 = |summationCv1∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst+ ∆|u1D7≠7|u1D4JDCst
|u1D437|oneCst(|u1D443∗+ |u1D447∗)/u1D4:̅.st|twoCsts  .

|u1D437|twoCst are material constants and |u1D447∗= |u1D447 |u1D4J3/c.st|minuteCst⁄ is the normalized maximum tensile hydrostatic 
pressure. 
 
The damage strength, DS , is deﬁned in compression when |u1D443∗ > 0 as 
DS = |u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCstmin /˙racketleft.v:SFMAX, |u1D434(1 − |u1D437) + |u1D43J|u1D443∗|u1D441Csts/˙racketright.v:[1 + |u1D436∗ln(|u1D7≠≠̇∗)]

4.  This material type requires that the model is orie nted such that the z-axis is 
deﬁned in the upward direction.  The key parameters  are deﬁned such that 
may vary with depth (i.e. the z-axis) 
5.  The shape factor for a typical soil would be 0.8, but should not be pushed 
further than 0.75. 
6.  If STR_LIM is set to less than 0.005, the value is  reset to 0.005. 
7.  A correction has been introduced into the Drucker Prager model, such that the 
yield surface never infringes the Mohr-Coulomb crit erion.  This means that the 
model does not give the same results as a “pure” Dr ucker Prager model. 
8.  The load curves LCCPDR, LCCPT, LCCJDR, LCCJT allow  additional cohesion 
to be speciﬁed as a function of time.  The cohesion  is additional to that speci- 
ﬁed in the material parameters.  This is intended f or use during the initial stag- 
es of an analysis to allow application of gravity o r other loads without cracking 
or yielding, and for the cracking or yielding then to be introduced in a con- 
trolled manner.  This is done by specifying extra c ohesion that exceeds the 
expected stresses initially, then declining to zero .  If no curves are speciﬁed, no 
extra cohesion is applied. 
9.  The load curve for factor on strength applies simu ltaneously to the cohesion 
and tan (friction angle) of parent material and all  joints.  This feature is intend- 
ed for reducing the strength of the material gradua lly, to explore factors of 
safety.  If no curve is present, a constant factor of 1 is assumed.  Values much 
greater than 1.0 may cause problems with stability.
