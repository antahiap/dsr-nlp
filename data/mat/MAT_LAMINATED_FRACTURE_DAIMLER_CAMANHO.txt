This is  Material Type 262 which is an orthotropic continuum  damage model for 
laminated ﬁber-reinforced composites.  See Maimí, C amanho, Mayugo and Dávila 
[2007].  It is based on a physical model for each f ailure mode and considers a simpliﬁed 
non-linear in-plane shear behavior.  This model is implemented for shell, thick shell and 
solid elements. 
NOTE:  Laminated shell theory can be applied by setting 
LAMSHT ≥ 3 in *CONTROL_SHELL.
