*. , |parenleftCv1|u1D46J, |u1D466,/u1D46̅|parenriµhtCv1, or (1,2,3) , refers to the local material coordi- 
nate system (|u1D44∆, |u1D44F,/u1D450); otherwise it refers to the global coordinate syst em. 
5.  CDF for Viscosity.   CDF can be used to consider the viscosity eﬀect f or high 
speed air ﬂow. 
6.  Nonlinearity.   LCPGD i can be used to deﬁne a non-linear Darcy’s law as 
follows: 
(CDARC Y + CDF × ||u1D463|u1D4J6Cst|) × PORE × |u1D463|u1D4J6Cst= PERM|u1D4J6 × |u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst|u1D71J|u1D443|u1D44∆Cst
|u1D71J|u1D46J|u1D4J6Cst, |u1D4J6 = 1,2,3 
where |u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst is the value of the function deﬁned by the LCPGD i ﬁeld.  The linear 
version of Darcy’s law (see Remark 2 ) can be recovered when the LCPGD i 
curves are deﬁned as straight lines of slope of 1. *.   *.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
an originating point, |u1D443, which deﬁne the centerline ax- 
is.  This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system ID 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ OPTION ).   
ISCL Load curve ID for the strain rate scale factor as a  function of the 
volumetric strain rate.  The yield stress is scaled  by the value 
speciﬁed by the load curve. 
BETA Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 0 (shells and tshells only) 
and AOPT = 3 (all element types).  This angle may be overridde n 
on the element card; see *ELEMENT_SHELL_BETA, *ELE-
MENT_TSHELL_BETA, and *ELEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO. 
MACF Material axes change ﬂag for solid elements: 
EQ.-4: Switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450 before BETA rotation 
EQ.-3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450 before BETA rotation 
EQ.-2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F before BETA rotation  
EQ.1: No change, default 
EQ.2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F after BETA rotation 
EQ.3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450 after BETA rotation 
EQ.4: Switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450 after BETA rotation 
Figure M2-2  indicates when LS-DY NA applies MACF during the 
process to obtain the ﬁnal material axes.  If BETA on *ELE-
MENT_SOLID_{OPTION} is deﬁned, then that BE TA is used for 
the rotation for all AOPT options.  Otherwise, if A OPT = 3, the 
BETA input on Card 3 rotates the axes.  For all other values of 
AOPT, the material axes will be switched as speciﬁe d by MACF, 
but no BETA rotation will be performed.
