Remarks: 
1.  SPR Geometry.  “Head” is the end of the SPR that fully perforates a sheet.  
“Tail” is the end that is embedded within the thick ness of a sheet.   
The sheet planes are deﬁned at the head by the quad rilateral deﬁned by nodes 
N1-N2-N3-N4 of the solid element; and at the tail b y the quadrilateral deﬁned 
by nodes N5-N6-N7-N8.  It is essential that the nod es N1 to N4 are ﬁxed to the 
head sheet (e.g. by direct meshing or tied contact) : the element has no stiﬀness 
to resist relative motion of nodes N1 to N4 in the plane of the head sheet.  Simi- 
larly, nodes N5 to N8 must be ﬁxed to the tail shee t 
The tail of the SPR is deﬁned as a point in the tai l sheet plane, initially at the 
center of the element face.  The head of the SPR is  initially at the center of the 
head sheet plane.  The SPR axis is deﬁned as the li ne joining the tail to the 
head.  Thus, the axis of the SPR would typically be  coincident with the solid 
element local /u1D46̅-axis if the solid is a cuboid.  It is the user’s r esponsibility to 
ensure that each solid element is oriented correctl y. 
During the analysis, the head and tail will always remain in the plane of the 
sheet but may move away from the centers of the she et planes if the shear forc- 
es in these planes are suﬃcient. 
2.  Young’s Modulus and Poisson’s Ratio.   E and PR are used only to calculate 
contact stiﬀness.  They are not used by the materia l model. 
3.  Axes.   Deformation is in length units and is on the |u1D46J-axis.  Force is on the |u1D466-
axis.  Rotation is in radians on the |u1D46J-axis.  Moment is on the |u1D466-axis. 
4.  Load Curve Assumptions.   All the load curves are expected to start at (0,0) . 
“Deformation” means the total deformation including  both elastic and plastic 
components, similarly for rotation. 
5.  “High Tide” Algorithm.   A “high tide” algorithm is used to determine the 
deformation or rotation to be used as the |u1D46J-axis of the load curves when look- 
ing up the current yield force or moment.  The “hig h tide” is the greatest dis- 
placement or rotation that has occurred so far duri ng the analysis. *.   
 13.  Initial Softening Displacements/Rotations.   If the inputs DFAXH, DFSHH, 
RFBMH, DFAXT, DFSHT, and RFBMT are non-zero, these values must be 
within the abscissa values of the relevant curve, s uch that the curve 
force/moment value is greater than zero at the deﬁn ed start of softening.   
If the inputs are left blank or zero, they will be calculated internally as follows: 
a)  Final failure will occur at the displacement or ro tation (DFAIL) at which 
the load curve reaches zero (determined, if necessa ry, by extrapolation 
from the last two points). 
b)  Displacement or rotation at which softening begins  is then back-
calculated.  For example, DFAXT = DFAIL (1 + DMGAXT) ⁄ . 
c)  If DMGAXT is left blank or zero, it defaults to 0. 1. 
d)  If the load curve does not drop to zero, and the ﬁ nal two points have a ze- 
ro or positive gradient, no failure or softening wi ll be caused by that dis- 
placement component. 
14.  Output Stress.   Output stresses (in the d3plot  and time-history output ﬁles) 
are set to zero.  
15.  Displacement Ratio.   The output variable “displacement ratio” (or rota tion 
ratio for bending), |u1D44J, is deﬁned as follows.  See also the Figure M211-1 . 
a)  |u1D44J = 0.0 to 1.0 .  The maximum force or moment on the input curve h as not 
yet been reached. |u1D44J is proportional to the maximum force or moment Displacement
