This is Material Type 255, an isotropic elastoplast ic material with thermal properties.  It 
can be used for both explicit and implicit analyses .  Young’s modulus and Poisson’s 
ratio can depend on the temperature by deﬁning two load curves.  Moreover, the yield 
stress in tension and compression are given as load  curves for diﬀerent temperatures by 
using two tables.  The thermal coeﬃcient of expansi on can be given as a constant AL-
PHA or as a load curve LALPHA. A positive curve ID for LALPHA models the 
instantaneous thermal coeﬃcient, whereas a negative s curve ID models the thermal 
coeﬃcient relative to a reference temperature, TREF .  The strain rate eﬀects are 
modelled with the Cowper-Symonds rate model with th e parameters C and P on 
Card 1.  Failure can be based on eﬀective plastic s train or using the *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
E Young’s modulus: 
LT.0.0: |E| is a load curve ID where |u1D438 is given as a function of 
temperature, |u1D447.  The curve consists of (|u1D447, |u1D438)  data pairs.  
GT.0.0: constant 
PR Poisson’s ratio. 
LT.0.0: |PR| is a load curve ID for Poisson’s ratio as a functio n 
of temperature. 
GT.0.0: constant 
C Strain rate parameter.  See Remark 1 . 
P Strain rate parameter.  See Remark 1 . 
FAIL Eﬀective plastic strain when the material fails.  U ser deﬁned 
failure subroutine, matusr_24  in dyn21.F , is called to determine 
failure when FAIL < 0.  Note that for solids the *M AT_ADD_-
EROSION can be used for additional failure criteria . 
TDEL A time step less than TDEL is not allowed.  A step size less than 
TDEL will trigger automatic element deletion.  This option is 
ignored for implicit analyses. 
TABIDC Table ID for yield stress in compression; se e Remark 2 . 
TABIDT Table ID for yield stress in tension; see Remark 2 . 
LALPHA Load curve I D for thermal expansion coeﬃcient as a function of 
temperature: 
GT.0: the instantaneous thermal expansion coeﬃcient based  on 
the following formula: 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst thermal = |u1D6F+(|u1D447)|u1D4J1|u1D447|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
LT.0: the thermal coeﬃcient is deﬁned relative a referenc e 
temperature TREF, such that the total thermal strai n is 
given by: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst thermal = |u1D6F+(|u1D447)(|u1D447 − |u1D447ref )|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
With this option active, ALPHA is ignored.
