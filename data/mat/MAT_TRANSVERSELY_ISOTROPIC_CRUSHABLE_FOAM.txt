  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MU Damping coeﬃcient for tensor viscosity which acts i n both 
tension and compression.  Recommended values vary b etween 
0.05 to 0.10.  If zero, bulk viscosity is used inst ead of tensor 
viscosity.  Bulk viscosity create s a pressure as the element 
compresses that is added to the normal stresses whi ch can have 
the eﬀect of creating transverse deformations when none are 
expected. 
AOPT Material axes option (see MAT _OPTION TROPIC_ELASTIC, 
particularly the Material Directions  section, for details): 
EQ.0.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes 1, 2, and 4, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_ NODES. For shells only, the material axes are 
then rotated a bout the normal vector to the surface of 
the shell by the angle BETA. 
EQ.1.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y a 
point, |u1D443, in space and the global location of the element 
center; this is the /u1D41A-direction.  This option is for solid 
elements only. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by a 
vector /u1D42F and the normal vector to the plane of the ele- 
ment.  The plane of a solid element is the midsurface 
between the inner surface and outer surface deﬁned by 
the ﬁrst four nodes and the last four nodes of the con- 
nectivity of the element, respectively.  Thus, for solid 
elements, AOPT = 3 is only available for hexahedrons. 
/u1D41A is determined by taking the cross product of /u1D42F with 
the normal vector, /u1D41B is determined by taking the cross 
product of the normal vector with /u1D41A, and /u1D41C is the nor- 
mal vector.  Then /u1D41A and /u1D41B are rotated about /u1D41C by an an- 
gle BETA. BETA m ay be set in the keyword input for 
the element or in the input for this keyword.  Note  that 
for solids, the material axes may be switched depen d- 
ing on the choice of MACF. The switch may occur be-
fore or after applying BE TA depending on the value of 
MACF.  
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotropic in a cylindrical coordinate sys tem 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and *.

This model behaves in a more physical way for oﬀ ax is loading the material than, for
