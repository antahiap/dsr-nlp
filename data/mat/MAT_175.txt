  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCIDK Load curve ID for bulk behavior if constants,  |u1D43∆|u1D4J6Cst, and |u1D6FD/u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst are 
determined using a least squares ﬁt.  This relaxati on curve is 
shown in Figure M175-1 . 
NTK Number of terms desired in bulk ﬁt.  If zero 6 term s are used by 
default.  Currently, the maximum number is set to 6 . 
BSTARTK In the ﬁt, |u1D6FD/u1D̅05|oneCst  is set to zero, |u1D6FD/u1D̅05|twoCst  is set to BSTARTK, |u1D6FD/u1D̅05|threeCst is 10 times 
|u1D6FD/u1D̅05|twoCst, |u1D6FD/u1D̅05|fourCst is 10 times |u1D6FD/u1D̅05|threeCst , and so on.  If z ero, BSTARTK is 
determined by an iterative trial and error scheme. 
TRAMPK Optional ramp time for bulk loading

Figure M175-1.   Relaxation curve.  This curve deﬁnes stress as a funct ion of 
time where time is deﬁned on a l ogarithmic scale.  For best results, the points 
deﬁned in the load curve should be equally spaced on th e logarithmic scale.  
Furthermore, the load curve should be smooth and deﬁne d in the positive 
quadrant.  If nonphysical values are determined by least squ ares ﬁt, LS-DY NA 
will terminate with an error message after the initializat ion phase is completed.  
If the ramp time for loading is included, then the rel axation which occurs 
during the loading phase is taken into account.  This eﬀ ect may or may not be 
important. *.

The Arrhenius and Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) shift  functions account for the eﬀects 
of the temperature on the stress relaxation.  A sca led time, |u1D461|minuteCst, 
|u1D461|minuteCst=/integral.v:Φ(|u1D447)|u1D4J1|u1D461 |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst , 
is used in the relaxation function instead of the p hysical time.  The Arrhenius shift 
function is 
Φ(|u1D447) = exp |<racketleftCvJ−|u1D434 |parenleftCvJ1
|u1D447−1
|u1D447REF |parenriµhtCvJ|<racketriµhtCvJ  , 
and the Williams-Landel-Ferry shift function is 
Φ(|u1D447) = exp |parenleftCvJ−|u1D434|u1D447 − |u1D447REF 
|u1D43J + |u1D447 − |u1D447REF |parenriµhtCvJ . 
If all three values (TREF, A, and B) are not zero, the WLF function is used; the 
Arrhenius function is used if B is zero; and no sca ling is applied if all three values are 
zero. *
