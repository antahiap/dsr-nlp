  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
AT Tensile damage evolution parameter |u1D6F+|u1D461Cst. Can be interpreted as the 
residual load carrying capacity ratio for tensile f ailure ranging 
from 0 to 1. 
BT Tensile damage evolution parameter, |u1D6FD|u1D461Cst. It controls the softening 
velocity for tensile failure. 
AC Compressive damage evolution parameter, |u1D6F+|u1D4J≠Cst. Can be interpreted 
as the residual load carrying capacity ratio for co mpressive failure 
ranging from 0 to 1. 
BC Compressive damage evolution parameter |u1D6FD|u1D4J≠Cst. It controls the 
softening velocity for compressive failure. 
FTSCL Scale factor for the tensile strength (defaul t = 1.0): 
FT mod = FTSCL × FT 
If RATENL = 0.0 (see Card 4), then the tensile strength drops to 
its original value, FT, as soon as the ﬁrst crack h appens in the 
associated part.  In this case, FTSCL > 1.0 can be helpful to model 
high force peaks in impact events. 
 
If RATENL ≠ 0.0, then, when a crack forms in a neighboring 
element, the tensile strength for an element is eva luated 
depending on the smoothed eﬀective strain rate (see  Remark 7 ).   
SFSTI Scale factor for stiﬀness after failure.  For  example, SFSTI = 0.001 
means that stiﬀness is reduced to 0.1% of the elast ic stiﬀness at 
failure. 
SFSTR Scale factor for stress in case of failure.  For example, SF-
STR = 0.01 means that stress is reduced to 1% of the fail ure stress 
at failure. 
ICRIN Flag for crack strain initialization: 
EQ.0.0: initial crack strain is strain at failure (default) . 
EQ.1.0: initial crack strain is zero. 
ECRCL Crack strain necessary to reactivate certain stress  components 
after crack closure 
NCYCR Number of cycles in which the stress is reduc ed to SF-
STR × failure stress 
NIPF Number of failed through thickness integration poin ts needed to 
fail all  through thickness integration points for IMOD = 0 *.

The modiﬁed versions, FMOD = 10, 11, 12, change wha t is considered tensile 
and compressive failure.  The form of the failure s tays the same for each type.  
In each case, a line with slope − |u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J3|u1D461Cst⁄ distinguishes the diﬀerence between the 
two types of failure.  See Figure M280-1  for an example of how the tensile and 
compressive failure are modiﬁed for the Rankine fai lure criterion. 
2.  Crack Formation.   As soon as failure happens in the tensile regime,  a crack 
occurs perpendicular to the maximum principal stres s direction.  That means a 
crack coordinate system is set up and stored, deﬁne d by a relative angle with 
respect to the element coordinate system.  Appropri ate stress and stiﬀness ten- 
sor components (e.g. normal to the crack) are reduc ed according to SFSTR and 
SFSTI if IMOD = 0. The stress reduction takes place  in a period of NCYCR time 
step cycles.  For IMOD = 1.0 the stress and stiﬀnes s tensor are reduced by a 
damage model (see Remark 5 ). A second crack orthogonal to the ﬁrst crack is 
possible which can open and close independently fro m the ﬁrst one, further 
reducing the element stiﬀness. 
3.  Crack Closure.   To deal with crack closure, the current strain in  principal 
stress direction is stored as initial crack strain (ICRIN = 0, default) or the initial 
crack strain is set to zero (ICRIN = 1).  After fai lure, the crack strain is tracked, 
so that later crack closure will be detected.  If t hat is the case, appropriate stress 
and stiﬀness tensor components (e.g. compressive) a re reactivated so that e.g. 
under pressure a load could be carried and cause a nonzero stress perpendicu- 
lar to the crack. /g11/g12

 Here |u1D7≠≠̇max = 10 /nine.st× RATENL . See Figure M280-2  for a plot of this tensile 
strength as a function of average strain rate.  The  average strain rate in this case 
is calculated as: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCsta v g = RFILTF × |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst−|oneCsta v g + (1 − RFILTF) × |u1D7≠≠ ̇|u1D4JBCst 
where |u1D4JB is the time step.
