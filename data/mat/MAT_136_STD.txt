Variable SYS SIP SHS SHL ESH E0 ALPHA LCID2 
Type F F F F F F F F 
 
 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
SYS Static yield stress, |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst 
SIP Stress increment parameter, ∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JACst 
SHS Strain hardening parameter for small strain, |u1D6FD 
SHL Strain hardening parameter for larger strain, Ω 
ESH Exponent for strain hardening, |u1D4JB 
E0 Initial plastic strain, |u1D7≠≠|zeroCst 
ALPHA Distribution of hardening used in the curve-ﬁ tting, |u1D6F+.  |u1D6F+=0 is 
pure kinematic hardening while |u1D6F+ = 1  provides pure isotropic 
hardening. 
LCID2 Curve ID. The curve deﬁnes Young’s modulus scaling factor with 
respect to th e plastic strain.  By default, the Young’s modulus is 
assumed to remain constant.  Eﬀective value is betw een 0 and 1.

In the case of kinematic hardening (ALPHA < 1), the  standard stress tensor is 
replaced by a relative stress tensor, deﬁned as the  diﬀerence between the stress 
tensor and a back stress tensor. *
