  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
ﬁle is part of the general usermat  package.  Note that in 
this case MULO is a parameter for the subroutine. 
GT.0.0:  this is the upper dynamic viscos ity limit.  This is 
deﬁned only if RK and RN are deﬁned for the variabl e 
viscosity case. 
RK Variable dynamic viscosity multiplier.  See Remark 6 . 
RN Variable dynamic viscosity exponent.  See Remark 6 . 
Remarks: 
1.  Deviatoric Viscous Stress.   The null material must be used with an equation-
of-state.  Pressure cutoﬀ is negative in tension.  A (deviatoric) viscous stress of 
the form 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst= 2|u1D7≠7|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst 
|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|<racketriµhtCvJ~|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ |<racketleftCvJ1
|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ 
is computed for nonzero |u1D7≠7 where |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst is the deviatoric strain rate.  |u1D7≠7 is the dy- 
namic viscosity.  For example, in SI unit system, |u1D7≠7 has a unit of [Pa × s] . 
2.  Hourglass Control Issues.   The null material has no shear stiﬀness and 
hourglass control must be used with care.  In some applications, the default 
hourglass coeﬃcient might lead to signiﬁcant energy  losses.  In general for 
ﬂuid(s), the hourglass coeﬃcient QM should be small  (in the range 10 -4 to 10 -6 
for the standard default IHQ choice). 
3.  Null Material Properties.   Null material has no yield strength and behaves i n 
a ﬂuid-like manner. 
4.  Numerical Cavitation.   The pressure cut-oﬀ, PC, must be deﬁned to allow for 
a material to “numerically” cavitate.  In other wor ds, when a material under- 
goes dilatation above certain magnitude, it should no longer be able to resist 
this dilatation.  Since dilatation stress or pressu re is negative, setting PC limit 
to a very small negative number would allow for the  material to cavitate once 
the pressure in the material goes below this negati ve value. 
5.  Issues with Small Values of Viscosity Exponent.   If the viscosity exponent is 
less than 1.0 ( RN < 1.0 ), then RN − 1.0 < 0.0.   In this case, at very low equiva- 
lent strain rate, the viscosity can be artiﬁcially very high.  MULO is then used 
as the viscosity value. *. .  It allows  the modeling of ﬂuid with 
constant or variable viscosity and a one-parameter mixing-length turbulence model .  The 
variable viscosity is a function of an equivalent d eviatoric strain rate.  The equation of 
state supplies the pressures for the stress tensor.   All *.  (*
