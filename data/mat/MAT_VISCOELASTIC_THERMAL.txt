This is Material Type 175.  This material model pro vides a general viscoelastic Maxwell 
model having up to 12 terms in the prony series exp ansion and is useful for modeling 
dense continuum rubbers and solid explosives.  Eith er the coeﬃcients of the prony 
series expansion or a relaxation curve may be speci ﬁed to deﬁne the viscoelastic 
deviatoric and bulk behavior.  Note that *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
PCF Tensile pressure elimination ﬂag for solid elements  only.  If set to 
unity, tensile pressures are set to zero. 
EF Elastic ﬂag: 
EQ.0:  the layer is viscoelastic. 
EQ.1:  the layer is elastic. 
TREF Reference temperature for shift function (must be g reater than 
zero) 
A Coeﬃcient for the Arrhenius and the Williams-Land el-Ferry shift 
functions 
B Coeﬃcient for the Williams-Landel-Ferry shift fun ction 
 
Relaxation Curve Card.   If ﬁtting is done from a relaxation curve, specify ﬁtting 
parameters on Card 2; otherwise  if constants are set on Viscoelastic Constant Cards , 
LEAVE THIS CARD BLANK .

Variable LCID NT BSTART TRAMP LCIDK NTK BSTARTK  TRAMPK 
Type F I F F F I F F 
 
 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCID Load curve ID for deviatoric behavior if const ants |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst and |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst are 
determined using a least squares ﬁt.  This relaxati on curve is 
shown in Figure M175-1 . 
NT Number of terms in shear ﬁt.  If zero, 6 terms are used by default.  
Fewer than NT terms will be us ed if the ﬁt produces one or more 
negative shear moduli.  Currently, the maximum numb er is set to 
6. 
BSTART In the ﬁt, |u1D6FD|oneCst  is set to zero, |u1D6FD|twoCst  is set to BSTART, |u1D6FD|threeCst is 10 times |u1D6FD|twoCst, 
|u1D6FD|fourCst is 10 times |u1D6FD|threeCst, and so on.  If zero, BSTART is determined by an 
iterative trial and error scheme. 
TRAMP Optional ramp time for loading *.   
 Viscoelastic Constant Cards.   Up to 6 cards may be input.  The next keyword (“*”)  
card terminates this input.  These cards are not ne eded if relaxation data is deﬁned 
(Card 2).  The number of terms for the shear behavi or may diﬀer from tha t for the bulk 
behavior: simply insert zero if a term is not inclu ded.  If an elastic layer is deﬁned, only 
Gi and K i need to be deﬁned (note in an elastic layer only o ne card is needed).

Remarks: 
Rate eﬀects are taken into accounted through linear  viscoelasticity by a convolution 
integral of the form: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst 
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst  , 
where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst(|u1D461Cst−/u1D̅0F.st) is the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent stres s measures.  This stress is 
added to the stress tensor determined from the stra in energy functional.  
 
If we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, the relaxation function is represented by 
six terms from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst  . 
We characterize this in the input by shear moduli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and decay constants, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.  An 
arbitrary number of terms, up to 6, may be used whe n applying the viscoelastic model. 
 
For volumetric relaxation, the relaxation function is also represented by the Prony series 
in terms of bulk moduli: *
