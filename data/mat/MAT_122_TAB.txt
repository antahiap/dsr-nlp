  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
about the shell element normal by an angle BETA 
EQ.2.0: globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
the vector /u1D41A deﬁned below, as with *DE-
FINE_COORDINATE_VECTOR 
EQ.3.0: locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector /u1D42F with the 
element normal 
LT.0.0: the absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system 
ID number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_NODES, *DE-
FINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DE-
FINE_COORDINATE_ VECTOR).  Available in R3 version of 971 
and later.
