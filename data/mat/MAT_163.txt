  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
NCYCLE Number of cycles to determine the average vo lumetric strain rate.  
SRCLMT Strain rate change limit. 
SFLAG The strain rate in the table may be the true strain rate (SFLAG = 0) 
or the engineering strain rate (SFLAG = 1). 
Remarks: 
The volumetric strain is deﬁned in terms of the rel ative volume, |u1D449, as: 
|u1D6F∆ = 1 −V 
The relative volume is deﬁned as the ratio of the c urrent to the initial volume.  In place 
of the eﬀective plastic strain in the d3plot  database, the integrated volumetric strain is 
output.

Figure M163-1.  Rate eﬀects are deﬁned by a family of curves giving y i eld 
stress as a function of volumetric strain where |u1D449 is the relative volume. *
