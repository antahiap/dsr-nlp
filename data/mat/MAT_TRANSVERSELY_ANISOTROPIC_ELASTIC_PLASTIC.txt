This is  Material Type 37.  This model is for simulating she et forming processes with 
anisotropic material.  Only transverse anisotropy c an be considered.  Optionally an 
arbitrary dependency of stress and eﬀective plastic  strain can be deﬁned with a load 
curve.  This plasticity model is fully iterative an d is available only for shell elements.   
Available options include: 
<BLANK> 
ECHANGE 
NLP_FAILURE 
NLP2 
The ECHANGE option allows the Young’s Modulus to ch ange during the simulation: 
 
The NLP_FAILURE option estimates failure using the Formability Index (F.I.) which 
accounts for the non-linear strain paths common in metal forming application (see 
Remarks 5  and 7).  The option NLP is also available for *.

ETAN Plastic hardening modulus.  When this value is nega tive, normal 
stresses (either from contact or applied pressure) are considered 
and *LOAD_SURFACE_ STRESS must be used to capture the 
stresses.  This feature is applicable to both shell  element types 2 
an d 16.  It is found in some cases this inclusion can  improve 
accuracy. 
The negative local /u1D46̅-stresses caused by the contact pressure can be 
viewed from d3plot  ﬁles after Revision 97158.  Prior to Revision 
97158, the negative local /u1D46̅-stresses are stored in history variable #5 .   
R Anisotropic parameter |u1D4JF̅, also commonly called r- bar, in sheet 
metal forming literature.  Its interpretation is gi ven in Remark 1 . 
GT.0: standard formulation 
LT.0: the anisotropic parameter is set to ||u1D44J|.  When |u1D44J is set to a 
negative value the algorithm is modiﬁed for better stabil- 
ity in sheet thickness or thinning for sheet metal forming 
involving high strength steels or in cases when the  simu- 
lation time is long.  This feature is available to both ele- 
ment formulations 2 and 16.  See Remark 2  and Figure

The isotropic case of von Mises plasticity can be r ecovered by setting: 
|u1D439 = |u1D43A =/u1D4:B=1

and

For the particular case of transverse anisotropy, w here properties do not vary 
in the |u1D46J|oneCst− |u1D46J|twoCst plane, the following relations hold:

where it has been assumed that |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|oneCst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst. 
Letting |u1D43∆ = |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst⁄ , the yield criteria can be written as: 
|u1D439(|u1D7≠∆) = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J2Cst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst  ,

The rate of plastic strain is assumed to be normal to the yield surface so |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JDCst is 
found from: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠6∂|u1D439
∂|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   . 
Now consider the case of plane stress, where σ|threeCst|threeCst = 0.  Also, deﬁne the anisot- 
ropy input parameter, |u1D44J, as the ratio of the in-plane plastic strain rate to the 
out-of-plane plastic strain rate, *.

4.  ECHANGE.   The Young’s modulus has been assumed to be consta nt.  
However, some researchers have found that Young’s m odulus decreases with 
respect to the increase of eﬀective plastic strain.   To accommodate this new 
observation, a new option of ECHANGE is added.  The re are two methods 
deﬁning the change of Young’s modulus change: 
The ﬁrst method is to use a curve to deﬁne the scal e factor with respect to the 
eﬀective plastic strain.  The value of this scale f actor should decrease from 1.0 
to 0.0 with the increase of eﬀective plastic strain . 
The second method is to use a function as proposed by Yoshida [2003]: 
|u1D438 = |u1D438|zeroCst− |parenleftCv2|u1D438|zeroCst− |u1D438|u1D434Cst|parenriµhtCv2|<racketleftCv11 − exp(−/u1D̅01|u1D7≠≠)|<racketriµhtCv1. 
An example of the option ECHANGE is provided in the  Remarks section of the
