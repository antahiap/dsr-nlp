This is Material 20.  Parts made from this material  are considered to belong to a rigid 
body (for each part ID).  The coupling of a rigid b ody with MADYMO and CAL3D can 
also be deﬁned using this material.  Alternatively,  a VDA surface can be attached as 
surface to model the geometry, such as for the tool ing in metal forming applications.  
Optional global and local constraints on the mass c enter can be deﬁned.  A local 
consideration for output and user-deﬁned airbag sen sors may also optionally be chosen.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCO Local coordinate system number for local output to rbdout .  LCO 
also speciﬁes the coordinate system used for *BOUND ARY_PRE-
SCRIBED_MOTION_RIGID_LO CAL.  Defaults to the principal 
coordinate system of the rigid body. 
A1 - V3 Alternative method for specifying local sys tem below: 
Deﬁne two vectors /u1D41A and /u1D42F, ﬁxed to the rigid body which are 
used for output and the user deﬁned airbag sensor s ubrou- 
tines.  The output parameters are in the directions  /u1D41A, /u1D41B, and /u1D41C
where  the latter are given by the cross products /u1D41C=/u1D41A×/u1D42F and 
/u1D41B=/u1D41C×/u1D41A.  This input is optional. 
Remarks: 
1.  Rigid Material.  The rigid material type 20 provides a convenient w ay of 
turning one or more parts comprised of beams, shell s, or solid elements into a 
rigid body.  Approximating a deformable body as rig id is a preferred modeling 
technique in many real world applications.  For exa mple, in sheet metal form- 
ing problems the tooling can properly and accuratel y be treated as rigid.  In the 
design of restraint systems the occupant can, for t he purposes of early design 
studies, also be treated as rigid.  Elements which are rigid are bypassed in the 
element processing and no storage is allocated for storing history variables; 
consequently, the rigid material type is very cost eﬃcient. 
2.  Parts.   Two unique rigid part IDs may not share common no des unless they 
are merged together using the rigid body merge opti on.  A rigid body, howev- 
er, may be made up of disjoint ﬁnite element meshes .  LS-DYNA assumes this 
is the case since this is a common practice in sett ing up tooling meshes in form- 
ing problems. *.

Both basic and extended coupling are available for coupling with MADYMO 
6.0.1: 
a)  Basic Coupling.   The external reference number (RE) must match the  exter- 
nal reference number in the MADYMO XML input ﬁle.  The coupling op- 
tion (COUPLE) must be deﬁned. 
b)  Extended Coupling.   Under this option MADYMO will handle the contact 
between the MADYMO and LS-DYNA models.  The externa l reference 
number (RE) and the coupling option (COUPLE) are no t needed.  All cou- 
pling surfaces that interface with the MADYMO model s need to be de- 
ﬁned in *CONTACT_COUPLING. *. _DISCRETE
