  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
ALPHA1, …, 
ALPHAN. Corresponding thermal expansion coeﬃcients 
Remarks: 
Volumetric behavior is treated as linear elastic.  The deviatoric strain rate is considered 
to be the sum of elastic and viscous strain rates: 
/u1D6C6̇total |minuteCst=/u1D6C6̇elastic |minuteCst+/u1D6C6̇v iscous |minuteCst=/u1D6D4̇′
2|u1D43A+ /u1D6D4′
2|u1D463  , 
where |u1D43A is the elastic shear modulus, |u1D463 is the viscosity coeﬃcient, and bold indicates a 
tensor.  The stress increment over one timestep |u1D4J1|u1D461  is 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠∆|minuteCst = 2|u1D43A/u1D̅:Ȧtotal |u1D4J1|u1D461 −|u1D43A
|u1D71≠|u1D4J1|u1D461 σ|minuteCst  . 
The stress before the update is used for σ′.  For shell elements the through-thickness 
strain rate is calculated as follows: 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst = 0 = |u1D43∆(|u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst|oneCst + |u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst|twoCst + |u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|threeCst )|u1D4J1|u1D461 + 2|u1D43A|u1D7≠≠′̇|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4J1|u1D461 −|u1D43A
|u1D71≠|u1D4J1|u1D461|u1D7≠∆|minuteCst
|threeCst|threeCst   , 
where the subscript 33 denotes the through-thicknes s direction and |u1D43∆ is the elastic bulk 
modulus.  This leads to: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|threeCst = −|u1D44∆(|u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst|oneCst + |u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst|twoCst ) + |u1D44F|u1D4JD 
|u1D44∆ =|parenleftCv4|u1D43∆ −2

|parenleftCv4|u1D43∆ +4

|u1D44F =|u1D43A|u1D4J1|u1D461 
|u1D71≠|parenleftCv4|u1D43∆ +4
3|u1D43A|parenriµhtCv4  
in which |u1D4JD is the pressure deﬁned as the negative of the hydr ostatic stress. 
 
The variation of viscosity with temperature can be deﬁned in any one of the 3 ways. 
i)  Constant, |u1D449 = |u1D449|zeroCst. Do not deﬁne constants, A, B, and C, or the piece wise curve 
(leave Card 4 blank). 
ii)  |u1D449 = |u1D449|zeroCst× 10 |parenleftCv3/u1D4:4.sts
/u1D44̅.sts−/u1D4:5.sts+/u1D4:6.st|parenriµhtCv3  
iii)  Piecewise curve: deﬁne the variation of viscosity with temperature. 
NOTE: Viscosity is inactive during dynamic re- 
laxation. *. _CURVE  
This is Material Type 60 which was developed to sim ulate forming of glass products 
(such as car windshields) at high temperatures.  De formation is by viscous ﬂow, but 
elastic deformations can also be large.  The materi al model, in which the viscosity may 
vary with temperature, is suitable for treating a w ide range of viscous ﬂow problems 
and is implemented for brick and shell elements.  L oad curves are used to represent the 
temperature dependence of Poisson’s ratio, Young’s modulus, the coeﬃcient of 
expansion, and the viscosity.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
PR_LC Load curve (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning Poisson’s ratio as a 
function of temperature. 
YM_LC Load curve (see *DEFINE_CURVE) deﬁning Young’ s mod ulus as 
a function of temperature. 
A_LC Load curve (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning the coeﬃcient of 
thermal expansion as a function of temperature. 
V_LC Load curve (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning the dynamic 
viscosity as a function of temperature. 
V_LOG Flag for the form of V_LC:  
EQ.1.0:  The value speciﬁed in V_ LC is the natural logarithm of 
the viscosity, ln |u1D449. The value interpolated from the 
curve is then exponentiated to obtain the viscosity .  
The logarithmic form is useful if the value of the vis- 
cosity changes by orders of magnitude over the tem-
perature range of the data. 
EQ.0.0:  The value speciﬁed in V_LC is the viscosity.  
Remarks: 
Volumetric behavior is treated as linear elastic.  The deviatoric strain rate is considered 
to be the sum of elastic and viscous strain rates:

2|u1D43A+ σ′
2|u1D463 
where |u1D43A is the elastic shear modulus, |u1D463 is the viscosity coeﬃcient, and bold indicates a 
tensor.  The stress increment over one timestep |u1D4J1|u1D461  is 
|u1D4J1/u1D̅48|minuteCst= 2|u1D43Aε̇total |minuteCst |u1D4J1|u1D461 −|u1D43A
|u1D463 |u1D4J1|u1D461 /u1D̅48′ 
The stress before the update is used for σ′.  For shell elements the through-thickness 
strain rate is calculated as follows. 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst = 0 = |u1D43∆(|u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst|oneCst + |u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst|twoCst + |u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|threeCst )|u1D4J1|u1D461 + 2|u1D43A|u1D7≠≠′̇|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4J1|u1D461 −|u1D43A
|u1D71≠|u1D4J1|u1D461|u1D7≠∆′|threeCst|threeCst  
where the subscript 33 denotes the through-thicknes s direction and |u1D43∆ is the elastic bulk 
modulus.  This leads to: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|threeCst = −|u1D44∆(|u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst|oneCst + |u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst|twoCst ) + |u1D44F|u1D4JD *
