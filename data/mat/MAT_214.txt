Remarks: 
1.  Strain Rate Effects.   Strain rate eﬀects are accounted for using a Cowp er-
Symonds model which scales the stress according to the strain rate: 
/u1D6D4ad j=/u1D6D4|parenleftCvJ1 +|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D443Cst  . 
In the above equation /u1D6D4 is the quasi-static stress, /u1D6D4ad j is the adjusted stress ac- 
counting for strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇, and |u1D436 (CCE) and |u1D443 (PCE) are the Cowper-Symonds 
factors which must be determined experimentally for  each material. 
The model captures the non-linear strain rate eﬀect s in many materials.  With 
its less than unity exponent, 1/|u1D4JD, this model captures the rapid increase in ma- 
terial properties at low strain rate, while increas ing less rapidly at very high 
strain rates.  Because stress is a function of stra in rate the elastic stiﬀness also 
is: 
/u1D404ad j=/u1D404|parenleftCvJ1 +|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D443Cst 
where /u1D404ad j is the adjusted elastic stiﬀness.  Additionally, t he strains to peak and 
strains to failure are assumed to follow a Cowper-S ymonds model with, possi- 
bly diﬀerent , constants 
|u1D7≠≠ad j=ε|parenleftCvJ1 +|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|u1D46≠Cst|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D443Cst/u1D460.sts  , 
where, |u1D7≠≠ad j is the adjusted eﬀective strain to peak stress or strain to failure, and 
|u1D436|u1D46≠Cst and |u1D443|u1D46≠Cst are CSE and PSE respectively. 
2.  Stress-Strain beyond Peak Stress.   When strained beyond the peak stress, 
the stress decreases linearly until it attains a va lue equal to SIGPOST, at which 
point the stress-strain relation becomes nonlinear.   In the non-linear region the 
stress is given by 
|u1D7≠∆ =  |u1D7≠∆post
