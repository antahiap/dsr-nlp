 order of increasing compression.  If the pressure d rops below the cutoﬀ value speciﬁed, 
it is reset to that value and the deviatoric stress  state is eliminated. 
 
If the load curve ID (LCYP) is provided as a positi ve number, the deviatoric, perfectly 
plastic, pressure dependent, yield function, /u1D̅1∫, is given as 
/u1D̅1∫=/radical.v13/u1D4:D|twoCst− |u1D439|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1 = |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst− |u1D439|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1 
where,  |u1D439|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1  is a tabulated function of yield stress as a funct ion of pressure, and the 
second invariant, /u1D4:D|twoCst, is deﬁned in terms of the deviatoric stress tenso r as: 
/u1D4:D|twoCst=1
2|u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   . 
If LCYP is negative, then the yield function become s: 
/u1D̅1∫=/u1D4:D|twoCst− |u1D439|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1  . 
 
If cracking is invoked by setting the residual stre ngth factor, B, on Card 2 to a value 
between 0.0 and 1.0, the yield stress is multiplied  by a factor |u1D4J3 which reduces with 
plastic strain according to a trilinear law as show n in Figure M78-1 . 
|u1D44F = residual strength factor 
|u1D7≠≠|oneCst= plastic stain at which crac k ing b egins 
|u1D7≠≠|twoCst= plastic stain at which residual strength is reache d 
|u1D7≠≠|oneCst and |u1D7≠≠|twoCst are tabulated functions of pressure that are deﬁne d by load curves, see Figure 
M78-2 .  The values on the curves are strain as a functio n of pressure and should be 
entered in order of increasing pressure.  The strai n values should always increase 
monotonically with pressure. 
 
By properly deﬁning the load curves, it is possible  to obtain the desired strength and 
ductility over a range of pressures; see Figure M78-3 .
