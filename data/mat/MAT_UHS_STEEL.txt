Discussion: 
The phase distribution during cooling is calculated  by solving the following rate 
equation for each phase transition 
/u1D44Ḃ|u1D4J8Cst= |u1D4J4|u1D4J8Cst(|u1D43A, |u1D436, |u1D447|u1D4J8Cst, |u1D444|u1D4J8Cst)|u1D4J3|u1D4J8Cst(/u1D44B|u1D4J8Cst)  ,/u1D458= 2,3,4 
where |u1D4J4|u1D4J8Cst is a function, taken from Li et al., dependent on the grain number |u1D43A, the 
chemical composition |u1D436, the temperature |u1D447, and the activation energy |u1D444.  Moreover, the 
function |u1D4J3|u1D4J8Cst is dependent on the actual phase /u1D44B|u1D4J8Cst= |u1D46J|u1D4J8Cst/|u1D46Je q  
|u1D4J3|u1D4J8Cst(/u1D44B|u1D4J8Cst) =/u1D44B|u1D4J8Cst|zeroCst/period.st|fourCst(/u1D44B.st|u1D4J8Csts−|oneCst)(1 −/u1D44B|u1D4J8Cst)|zeroCst/period.st|fourCst/u1D44B.st|u1D4J8Csts  ,/u1D458= 2,3,4 
The true amount of martensite, that is, /u1D458= 5, is modelled by using the true amount of 
the austenite left after the bainite phase: 
|u1D46J|fiveCst= |u1D46J|oneCst/˙racketleft.v21 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FC.st(MS−|u1D447Cst)/˙racketright.v2  , 
where |u1D46J|oneCst is the true amount of austenite left for the react ion, |u1D6F+ is a material dependent 
constant and MS is the start temperature of the mar tensite reaction.

value means large grains and vice 
versa) 
2.  Excluding Phases.   To exclude a phase from the simulation, set the P HASE 
parameter accordingly. 
3.  STRC and STRP.   Note that both strain rate parameters must be set  to include 
the eﬀect.  It is possible to use a temperature dep endent load curve for both 
parameters simultaneously or for one parameter keep ing the other constant. 
4.  TUNIT.   TUNIT is time units per hour and is only used for  calculating the 
Vicker Hardness.  By default, it is assumed that th e time unit is seconds.  If 
another time unit is used, for example milliseconds , then TUNIT must be 
changed to TUNIT = 3.6 × 10 |sixCst 
5.  TSF.   The thermal speedup factor TSF of *CONTROL_THERMA L_SOLVER is 
used to scale reaction kinetics and hardness calcul ations in this material model.  
Strain rate dependent properties (see LCY1 to LCY5 or STRC/STRP), however, 
are not scaled by TSF. 
6.  CRSH.   With the CRSH = 1 option it is now possible to tr ansfer the material 
properties from a hot stamping simulation (CRSH = 0 ) into another simulation.  
The CRSH = 1 option reads a dynain  ﬁle from a simulation with CRSH = 0 and 
keeps all the history variables (austenite, ferrite , pearlite, bainite, martensite, 
etc.) constant.  This will allow steels with inhomo geneous strength to be ana- 
lyzed in, for example, a crash simulation.  The spe ed with the CRSH = 1 option 
is comparable with *.   *.   
 the martensite YM-curve.  If you use the PHASE opti on you only need to de- 
ﬁne the curves for the included phases, but you can  deﬁne all ﬁve.  LS-DYNA 
uses the number 1 - 5 to get the right curve for th e right phase.  The total YM is 
calculated by a linear mixture law: Y M =Y M1 × P H ASE1 +⋯+Y M5 ×
P H ASE5 .  For example:

10.  Using the Table Capability for Latent Heat.   When using a table ID for the 
latent heat (LAT1) you can describe all phase trans ition individually.  Use *DE-
FINE_TABLE_2D and set the abscissa values to the co rresponding phase tran- 
sition number, that is, 2 for austenite to ferrite,  3 for austenite to pearlite, 4 for 
austenite to bainite and 5 for austenite to martens ite.  Remark 9  demonstrates 
the form of a correct table deﬁnition.  If a curve is missing, the corresponding 
latent heat for that transition will be set to zero .  Also, when a table is used the 
LAT5 is ignored.  If HEAT > 0, you also have the op tion to include latent heat 
for the transition back to Austenite.  This latent heat curve is marked as 1 in the 
table deﬁnition of LAT1. 
11.  Using the Table Capability for Thermal Expansion.  When using a table ID 
for the thermal expansion you can specify the expan sion characteristics for 
each phase.  That is, you can have a curve for each  of the 5 phases (austenite, 
ferrite, pearlite, bainite, and martensite).  The i nput is identical to the above 
table deﬁnitions.  The table must have the abscissa  values between 1 and 5 
where the number correspond to phase 1 to 5. To exc lude one phase from in- 
ﬂuencing the thermal expansion you simply input a c urve that is zero for that 
phase or even easier, exclude that phase number in the table deﬁnition.  For 
example, to exclude the bainite phase you only deﬁn e the table with curves for 
the indices 1, 2, 3 and 5. 
12.  TEMPER.   Tempering is activated by setting TEMPER to 1.  W hen active, the 
default hardness calculation for bainite and marten site is altered to use an in- 
cremental update formula.  The total hardness is gi ven by ∑HV |u1D4J6× |u1D46J |u1D4J65
|u1D4J6=1. When 
holding phases are detected, the hardness for Baini te and Martensite is updat- 
ed according to *.

248 features: 
1.  a more ﬂexible choice of evolution parameters, 
2.  an approach for transformation induced strains, 
3.  and a more accurate density calculation of individ ual phases. 
Thus, the physical eﬀects of the metal can be taken  into account calculating the volume 
fractions of ferrite, pearlite, bainite and martens ite for fast supercooling as well as for 
slow cooling conditions.  Furthermore, this materia l model features cooling-rate 
dependence for several of its more crucial material  parameters in order to accurately 
calculate the Time-Temperature-Transformation diagr am dynamically.  A detailed 
description can be found in Hippchen et al.  [2013]  and Hippchen [2014].
