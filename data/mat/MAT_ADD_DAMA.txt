Remarks: 
1.  DEPS.   In DIEM, you may invoke up to 5 damage initiation  and evolution 
criteria.  For the sake of eﬃciency, the parameter DEPS can be used to only 
check these criteria in quantiﬁed increments of pla stic strain.  In other words, 
the criteria are only checked when the eﬀective pla stic strain goes beyond 
DEPS , 2 × DEPS , 3 × DEPS , etc.  For DEPS = 0 the checks are performed in ea ch 
step there is plastic ﬂow.  A reasonable value of D EPS could, for instance, be 
DEPS = 0.0001. *MAT  *. GE_DIEM  *MAT  
LS-DYNA R13 2-53 (MAT) The damage variable relates the macroscopic (damage d) to microscopic (true) 
stress by 
|u1D7≠∆ = (1 − |u1D437)|u1D7≠∆̃  . 
Once the damage has reached the level of |u1D437|eCst /r.st/o.st/d.st |eCst  (=0.99 by default) the stress is 
set to zero and the integration point is assumed fa iled and not processed there- 
after.  For NUMFIP > 0, a shell element is eroded a nd removed from the ﬁnite 
element model when NUMFIP integration points have f ailed.  For NUM-
FIP < 0, a shell element is eroded and removed from  the ﬁnite element model 
when -NUMFIP percent of the layers have failed. 
Damage Initiation, /u1D̅4E/u1D46B: 
For each evolution type  |u1D4J6, |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4J6Cst governs the onset of damage.  For |u1D4J6 ≠/u1D45̅, the evolution of 
|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4J6Cst is independent from the evolution of  |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4J7Cst.  The following list enumerates the 
algorithms for modelling damage initiation. 
 
In this subsection we suppress the superscripted |u1D4J6 indexing the evolution type. 
1.  Ductility Based on Stress Triaxiality (DITYP = 0).  For the ductile initiation 
option, a function |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D7≠2, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst) represents the plastic strain at onset of dam- 
age (P1).  This is a function of stress triaxiality  deﬁned as 
|u1D7≠2 = −|u1D4JD
/u1D45E  , 
with |u1D4JD being the pressure and /u1D45E the von Mises equivalent stress.  Optionally 
this can be deﬁned as a table with the second depen dency being on the eﬀec- 
tive plastic strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, where a negative sign of the ﬁrst strain rate in the 
table means that it is in logarithmic scale. The da mage initiation history varia- 
ble evolves according to 
|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st=/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠Cst|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst  . 
2.  Shear (DITYP = 1).  For the shear initiation option, a function |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst(/u1D̅0:, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst) 
represents the plastic strain at onset of damage (P 1).  This is a function of a 
shear stress function deﬁned as 
/u1D̅0:=/u1D45E+/u1D458/u1D446.st|u1D4JD
/u1D̅0F  . 
Here |u1D4JD is the pressure, /u1D45E is the von Mises equivalent stress and /u1D̅0F is the maxi- 
mum shear stress deﬁned as a function of the princi pal stress values: 
/u1D̅0F=|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst /∗.st/o.st/r.st− |u1D7≠∆|mCst|iCst|nCst /o.st/r.st|parenriµhtCv2
2  . *MAT  *. GE_DIEM  *MAT  
LS-DYNA R13 2-55 (MAT) |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st=/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠Cst|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst  . 
For this initiation option with shells, P2 is used to determine the layer in the 
shell where the criterion is evaluated.  If P2 = 0,  the criterion is evaluated in the 
mid-layer only, whereas if P2 = 1, it is evaluated in the outer layers only (bot- 
tom and top).  This can be used to distinguish betw een a membrane instability 
typically used for FLD evaluations (P2 = 0) and a b ending instability (P2 = 1).  
For shells, as soon as |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st reaches 1 in any of the integration points of inte rest, 
all  integration points in the shell goes over in damag e mode, meaning subse- 
quent damage is applied to the entire element.  For  solids/tshells, only P2 = 0 
is currently supported, and when |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st reaches 1 in the center of the section then 
all elements in the section goes into damage mode.  Again, more details for 
solids or thick shells are provided in the section titled MSFLD and FLD with 
solid and thick shell elements . 
4.  FLD (DITYP = 3).  The FLD initiation criterion is identical to MSFLD  with one 
subtle diﬀerence: the plastic strain used to evalua te the criteria does not ac- 
count for the sign of the hydrostatic stress but is  instead identical to the eﬀec- 
tive plastic strain directly from the underlying ma terial model.  In other words, 
it is not the modiﬁed plastic strain used in the MS FLD criterion, but apart from 
that it is an identical criterion. 
5.  Ductile based on normalized principal stress (DITYP  = 4).  For the ductile 
initiation option the plastic strain at the onset o f damage (P1) is taken as a func- 
tion of |u1D6FD and |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, that is |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D6FD, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst). Here |u1D6FD is the normalized principal stress 
|u1D6FD =/u1D45E+/u1D458/u1D451.st|u1D4JD
|u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst /∗.st/o.st/r.st   , 
where |u1D4JD is the pressure, /u1D45E is the von Mises equivalent stress, |u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst /∗.st/o.st/r.st is the major 
principal stress, and /u1D458/u1D451.st is the pressure inﬂuence parameter speciﬁed in the  P2 
ﬁeld.  Optionally, this can be deﬁned as a table wi th the second dependency 
being on the eﬀective plastic strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, where a negative sign of the ﬁrst 
strain rate in the table means that it is in logari thmic scale. The damage initia- 
tion history variable evolves according to 
|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st=/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠Cst|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst  . 
 
MSFLD and FLD with solid and thick shell elements 
 
When using MSFLD or FLD with solid or thick shell e lements, the following restrictions 
apply: *MAT  *. GE_DIEM  *MAT  
LS-DYNA R13 2-57 (MAT) |u1D462̇|u1D4JDCst= |<raceleftCvJ0 |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st< 1
/u1D45∫|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st≥ 1 
Here /u1D45∫ is a characteristic length of the element.  Fractu re energy is related to plastic 
displacement as follows 
|u1D43A/u1D45:.st=/integral.v:|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D4J1|u1D462|u1D4JDCst|u1D462Cst/u1D45:.sts|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst  , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst is the yield stress.  The following list enumerate s the algorithms available for 
modelling damage. 
1.  Linear (DETYP = 0).  With this option, if |u1D6F+ = 0  (Q3) and Q1 is positive, the 
damage variable evolves linearly with the plastic d isplacement after onset of 
damage: 
|u1D437̇=|u1D462̇|u1D4JDCst
|u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst  .  
Here |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst is the plastic displacement at failure (Q1).  
If Q1 is negative, then –Q1 refers to a table that deﬁnes |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst as a function of triax- 
iality and damage, that is, |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst= |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D7≠2, |u1D437) . In this case with |u1D6F+ = 0 , the damage 
evolution law generalizes to:  
|u1D437̇=|u1D462̇|u1D4JDCst
∂|u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst
∂|u1D437 . 
For a ﬁxed triaxiality, |u1D7≠2, |u1D462̅/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst:= |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D7≠2, 1)  deﬁnes the plastic displacement at fail- 
ure, and the shape of |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D7≠2, |u1D437)  as a function of |u1D437 determines the post-instability 
characteristics.  
A linear curve, as illustrated by the solid line in  Figure 2-2 , corresponds exactly 
to a constant plastic displacement to failure equal  to |u1D462̅/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst and can be seen as a 
reference curve for this discussion.  For simplicit y assume uniaxial tension ( |u1D7≠2 =
1/3). A curve with positive curvature, represented by the dash-dots in Fig- 
ure 2-2 , means that damage evolves quickly right after ons et of instability and 
more slowly when approaching failure.  In contrast,  damage evolves slowly 
early and more quickly later on for a curve with ne gative curvature, represent- 
ed by the dashes.  The qualitative eﬀect these curv es have in a uniaxial tension 
test is also illustrated.  The correlation between a damage curve and the actual 
behavior in tests is not straightforward, thus thes e curves need to be estab- 
lished on a trial-and-error basis. 
For |u1D6F+ > 0  and |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst> 0, the damage evolution follows an exponential law g iven 
by *MAT  *. GE_DIEM  *MAT

where |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst= 2|u1D43A/u1D45:.st/|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCsts and |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCsts is the yield stress when failure criterion is reac hed. *MAT  *. GE_GISSMO _{OPTION}

damage, just with the given reference element size.  
LT.0: The reference element size is |REFS Z |. In addition to the 
reference size related damage values, a correspondi ng 
plastic strain is computed and written to history v ariable 
ND + 17. See remarks for details.   
NUMFIP Number or percentage of failed integration points prior to 
element deletion (default value is 1).  When the ma terial is a 
composite with diﬀerent through-the- thickness material types 
deﬁned using *PART_COMPOS ITE, then values other than 1 will 
not work correctly; use *DEFINE_ELEMENT_EROSION ins tead. 
GT.0.0: Number of integration points which must fail before  
element is deleted.  
LT.0.0: Applies only to shells. |N U MFIP|  is the percentage of 
layers which must fail before an element is deleted .  
For shell formulations with 4 integration points p er 
layer, the layer is considered failed if any of the  inte- 
gration points in the layer fails. 
LCSDG Failure strain curve/table or function: 
GT.0.0: Load curve ID or table ID. As a load curve, it deﬁn es 
equivalent plastic strain to failure as a function of triax- 
iality.  As a table, it deﬁnes for each Lode parame ter 
value (between - 1 and 1) a load curve ID giving the 
equivalent plastic strain to failure as a function of triax- 
iality for that Lode parameter value.  With HISVN ≠  0, 
a 3D table can be used, where failure strain is a f unc- 
tion of the history variable (TABLE_3D), Lode param e- 
ter (TA BLE), and triaxiality (CURVE).  With 
HISVN = 0, a 3D table i ntroduces thermal eﬀects, that 
is, failure strain is a function of temperature (TA BLE_-
3D), Lode parameter (TA BLE), and triaxiality 
(CURVE).  
LT.0.0: |LCSDG|  is the ID of a function (*DEFINE_FUNC TION) 
with the arguments triaxiality and Lode parameter: 
|u1D4J3(|u1D7≠2,/u1D4:F). 
ECRIT Critical plastic strain (material instability ); see below. 
LT.0.0: |ECRIT|  is either a load curve ID deﬁning critical 
equivalent plastic strain versus triaxiality or a t able ID 
deﬁning critical equivalent plastic strain as a fun ction *. GE_GISSMO

GT.0: Scale ECRIT. 
LT.0: Do not scale ECRIT. 
SHRF Reduction factor for regularization for shear stres s states.  This 
parameter can be deﬁned between - 1.0 and +1.0. See remarks 
below. 
BIAXF Reduction factor for regularization for biaxial str ess states.  This 
parameter can be deﬁned between -1.0 and +1.0 . See remarks 
below. 
LCDLIM Load curve ID deﬁning damage limit values as a func tion of 
triaxiality.  Damage can be restricted to values le ss than 1.0 to 
prevent further stress reduction and failure for ce rtain 
triaxialities. 
MIDFAIL Mid-plane failure op tion for shell elements.  If active, then critical 
strain is only checked at the mid- plane integration point (IP), 
meaning an odd number for NIP should be used.  The other 
integration points compute their damage, but no cou pling to the 
stresses is done ﬁrst.  As soon as the mid- plane IP reaches 
ECRIT/DCRIT, then all the other IPs are also checke d.  
EQ.0.0: Inactive. 
EQ.1.0: Active.  Those of the non-mid- plane IPs that are 
already above their critical value immediately star t to 
reduce the stresses.  Those still below the critica l value 
still do not couple, only if they reach their crite rion.  
EQ.2.0: Active.  All of the non-mid- plane IPs immediately start 
to reduce the stresses.  NUMFIP is active. 
EQ.3.0: Active.  Same as 2 but when D = 1 is reached in the 
middle integration point, the element is eroded ins tan- 
taneously.  NUMFIP is disregarded.  
EQ.4.0: Active.  Damage and fai lure are applied only to the 
midpoint.  When D = 1 at the midpoint, the element is 
eroded.  NUM FIP is disregarded.  Integration points 
away from the midplane see no stress reduction and no 
failure. 
HISVN History variable used to evaluate the 3D tabl e LCS DG (and 
optionally 3D table ECRIT < 0): *. GE_GISSMO  
2-66 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 The model is based on an incremental formulation of  damage accumulation: 
∆|u1D437 =DMGEXP×|u1D437|parenleftCv4|oneCst−|oneCst
DMGEXP |parenriµhtCv4
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst 
where, 
|u1D437 Damage value  (0 ≤ |u1D437 ≤ 1).  For numerical reasons, |u1D437 is initialized to a 
value of 10 -20  for all damage types in the ﬁrst time step. 
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st Equivalent plastic strain to failure, determined f rom LCSDG as a function 
of the current triaxiality value |u1D7≠2 (and Lode parameter /u1D4:F as an option). 
A typical failure curve LCSDG for metal sheet, mode lled with shell ele- 
ments is shown in Figure 2-3 . Triaxiality should be monotonically increas- 
ing in this curve.  A reasonable range for triaxial ity is -2/3 to 2/3 if shell 
elements are used (plane stress). 
For 3-dimensional stress states (solid elements), t he possible range of tri- 
axiality goes from −∞ to +∞, but to get a good resolution in the internal 
load curve discretization (depending on parameter L CINT of *CON-
TROL_SOLUTION) you should deﬁne lower limits, such as -1 to 1 if 
LCINT = 100 (default). 
 ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst Equivalent plastic strain increment 
 
For constant values of failure strain, this damage rate can be integrated to get a relation 
of damage and actual equivalent plastic strain:

2-68 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 using the following relation, which is similar to t he accumulation of damage |u1D437 
except for the instability curve is used as an inpu t:

 |u1D439 Instability measure ( 0 ≤ |u1D439 ≤ 1 ).  
 |u1D7≠≠p,loc  Equivalent plastic strain to instability, determin ed from ECRIT 
 ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst Equivalent plastic strain increment 
As soon as the instability measure |u1D439 reaches unity, the current value of damage 
|u1D437 in the respective element is stored.  Damage will from this point on be cou- 
pled to the ﬂow stress using the relation described  above. 
3.  If no input for ECRIT is made, parameter DCRIT wil l be considered.  Coupling 
of damage to the stress tensor starts if this value  (damage threshold) is exceeded 
(0 ≤ DCRIT ≤ 1).  Coupling of damage to stress is d one using the relation de- 
scribed above. 
This input allows for the use of extreme values als o – for example, DCRIT = 1.0 
would lead to no coupling at all, and element delet ion under full load (brittle 
fracture). 
 
The values of SHRF and BIAXF generally lie between 0.0 and 1.0 where 0.0 means full 
regularization and 1.0 means no regularization unde r shear (triaxiality = 0.0 for 
SHRF = 1.0) or biaxial tension (triaxiality = 2/3 f or BIAXF = 1.0).  Any other 
intermediate triaxiality follows a linear interpola tion between triaxiality 0.0 and 1/3 and 
also between triaxiality 1/3 and 2/3. Notice that a  full regularization is always 
undertaken for a one-dimensional tensile stress sta te (triaxiality = 1/3) according to the 
factors deﬁned under LCREGD. For the sake of genera lization, both SHRF and BIAXF 
can also assume negative values (e.g., SHRF = -1.0 and BIAXF = -1.0).  In this case, 
regularization is aﬀected not at triaxialities 0.0 and 2/3 but rather at the triaxialities 
where the failure curve (LCSDG) crosses the instabi lity curve (-ECRIT).  The use of a 
triaxiality-dependent regularization approach may b e necessary because simple 
regularization only depending on the element size c an be unrealistic for certain stress 
states. 
If the results of a ﬁrst simulation should be trans ferred to a second computation with 
potentially modiﬁed mesh size, such as mapping from  forming to crash, it might be 
necessary to alter damage values (and maybe plastic  strain) as well.  For that purpose, 
reference element size REFSZ can be deﬁned.  With R EFSZ  >  0, corresponding damage 
is computed in the same fashion as the actual damag e, just with the given reference 
element size instead, and written to history variab le ND + 9. An alternative approach is *. GE_GISSMO

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCFLD Load curve ID or table ID. Load curve deﬁnes the Fo rming Limit 
Diagram, where minor engineering strains in percent  are deﬁned 
as abscissa values and major engineering strains in  percent are 
deﬁned as ordinate values.  Table deﬁnes for each s train rate *MAT  *.  GE_GISSMO.  If 
NHIS = 1 and HIS1 = 0 is used, this keyword behaves  the same as GISSMO. 
The main diﬀerence between this keyword and GISSMO is that up to 3 inde- 
pendent but simultaneous damage evolutions are poss ible.  Therefore, parame- 
ters LCSDG, ECRIT, DMGEXP, DCRIT, FADEXP, LCREGD, L CSRS, SHRF, BI-
AXF, and LCDLIM can be deﬁned separately for each h istory variable. *. GE can be included  for damage and 
failure.  But as in the original model, a viscoelas tic extension can be activated.  
This model is based on a complete re-coding of the plasticity algorithm.  The eﬃciency 
was improved to the extent that the computing times  should be shorter.  As compared 
to *. GE_ DIEM for a description of 
ductile damage initialization (DITYP = 0) based on stress 
triaxiality and a linear damage evolution (DETYP = 0) type.  Also 
see ﬁelds LCDI and UPF on Card 9.
