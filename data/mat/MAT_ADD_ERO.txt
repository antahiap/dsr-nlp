eliminates from consideration any failure criterion  who se failure 
value is left blank or set to 0.0.

LS-DYNA R13 2-73 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
EFFEPS Maximum eﬀective strain at failure: 
|u1D7≠≠eff = |summationCv1/radical.v52
3|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst de v |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst de v 
|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
If the value is exactly zero, it is automatically e xcluded to 
maintain compatibility with old input ﬁles.  If the  value is 
negative, then |EFFEPS|  is the eﬀective plastic strain at failure.  In 
combination with cohesive elements, EF FEPS is the maximum 
eﬀective in-plane strain. 
VOLEPS Volumetric strain at failure, 
|u1D7≠≠v ol = |u1D7≠≠|oneCst|oneCst + |u1D7≠≠|twoCst|twoCst + |u1D7≠≠|threeCst|threeCst   , 
or 
ln(relati v e v olume)  . 
VOLEPS can be a positive or negative number dependi ng on 
whether the failure is in tension or compression, r espectively.  If 
the value is exactly zero, it is automatically excluded to maintain 
compatibility with old input ﬁles. 
NUMFIP Number or percentage of failed integration points p rior to 
element deletion (default is 1).  See Remark 2 .  NUM FIP does not 
apply to higher order solid element types 24, 25, 2 6, 27, 28, and 29, 
rather see the variable VOL FRAC. Also, when the material is a 
composite deﬁned with *PART_COMPOS ITE with diﬀerent 
materials through-the-thickness, this ﬁeld sh ould not be used; use 
*DEFINE_ELEMENT_EROSION instead. 
GT.0.0: Number of integration points which must fail before  
element is deleted  
LT.0.0: Applies only to shells. |N U MFIP|  is the percentage of 
integration points which must exceed the failure cr ite- 
rion before the element fails.  If NUMFIP < - 100, then 
|N U MFIP|-100  is the number of failed integration 
points prior to element deletion. 
NCS Number of failure conditions to satisfy before fail ure occurs.  For 
example, if SIGP1 and SIGVM are deﬁned and if NCS =  2, both 
failure criteria must be met before element deletio n can occur.  
The default is set to unity.

i)  A nonlocal failure criterion which is mainly inten ded for windshield im- 
pact can be deﬁned using ENGCRT, RADCRT, and one ad ditional “main” 
failure criterion (only SIGP1 is available at the m oment).  All three param- 
eters should be deﬁned for one part, namely the win dshield glass and the 
glass should be discretized with shell elements.  T he course of events of 
this nonlocal failure model is as follows: If the m ain failure criterion SIGP1 
is fulﬁlled, the corresponding element is ﬂagged as  center of impact, but 
no element erosion takes place yet.  Then, the inte rnal energy of shells in- 
side a circle, deﬁned by RADCRT, around the center of impact is tested 
against the product of the given critical energy EN GCRT and the “area 
factor”.  The area factor is deﬁned as, 
Area Factor =total area of shell elements found inside the circl e 
2/u1D̅0B× RADCRT |twoCst 
The reason for having two times the circle area in the denominator is that 
we expect two layers of shell elements, as would ty pically be the case for 
laminated windshield glass.  If this energy criteri on is exceeded, all ele- 
ments of the part are now allowed to be eroded by t he main failure crite- 
rion. 
j)  An element size dependent mixed-mode fracture crit erion (MMFC) can be 
deﬁned for shell elements using load curves LCEPS12 , LCEPS23, and 
LCEPSMX.  Failure happens if NCS (see Card 1) of th ese three criteria are 
met

LCEPS13 :    |u1D6F∆|oneCst|threeCst =|oneCst
|twoCst(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst− |u1D7≠≠|threeCst) ≥ |u1D6F∆|oneCst|threeCst |u1D4J≠Cst(/u1D45∫|u1D4J2Cst)   if    − 0.5 ≤ |u1D7≠≠|twoCst|u1D7≠≠|oneCst⁄ ≤ 1.0
LCEPSMX :    |u1D7≠≠|oneCst≥ |u1D7≠≠|oneCst|u1D4J≠Cst(/u1D45∫|u1D4J2Cst)            if    − 0.5 ≤ |u1D7≠≠|twoCst|u1D7≠≠|oneCst⁄ ≤ 1.0 
where |u1D6F∆|oneCst|twoCst  and |u1D6F∆|oneCst|threeCst  are in-plane and through-thickness shear strains, |u1D7≠≠|oneCst and 
|u1D7≠≠|twoCst are in-plane major and minor strains, and |u1D7≠≠|threeCst is the through-thickness 
strain.  The characteristic element size is /u1D45∫|u1D4J2Cst and it is computed as the 
square root of the shell element area.  More detail s can be found in Zhu & 
Zhu (2011). 
2.  NUMFIP.   Element erosion depends on the type of element an d the value of 
NUMFIP. 
a)  When NUMFIP > 0, elements erode when NUMFIP points  fail.  
b)  For shells only, when -100 ≤ NUMFIP < 0, elements erode when |N U MFIP|  
percent of the integration points fail.   *. SION or *. -
