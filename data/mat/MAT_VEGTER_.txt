This is Material Type 136_STD, a plane stress ortho tropic material model for metal 
forming.  Yield surface construction is based on th e interpolation by second-order 
Bezier curves, and model parameters are determined directly from a set of mechanical 
tests conducted for a number of directions.  For ea ch direction, four mechanical tests are 
carried out: a uniaxial, an equi-biaxial, a plane s train tensile test and a shear test.  The 
material formulation is equivalent to . STANDARD

LCID Load curve ID or table ID.  If deﬁned, SYS, SIP, SH S, SHL, ESH, 
E0, DYS, RATEN, SRN0, and EXSR are ignored. 
Load Curve.   When LCID is a load curve ID, it is taken as 
deﬁning eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀective p lastic strain.  
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the stress as a function eﬀect ive plastic strain 
for that strain rate.    Linear interpolation betwe en the discrete 
strain rates is used by default. 
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   A way to invoke logarithmic 
interpolation between discrete strain rates is desc ribed as follows.  
If the ﬁrst  value in the table is negative, LS-DY NA assumes that 
all the table values represent the natural logarithm of a strain rate.  
There is some additional computational cost associa ted with 
invoking logarithmic interpolation.

 between the hinge points on both sides.  This dista nce is deﬁned by fac- 
tor  |u1D6F+ps = |u1D6F+|oneCst|u1D6F+|twoCst⁄, as shown in Figure M136-1 .  This approach is favored in most 
publications and has for example been discussed in the PhD-thesis of Pijlman, 
H. H. (2001). 
To determine the yield stress or reference points o f the Vegter yield locus, four 
mechanical tests must be performed for diﬀerent dir ections.  A good descrip- 
tion about the material characterization procedure can be found in Vegter et al.  
(2003).

PHA = 1) is given as:

with the equivalent stress |u1D7≠∆e q  obtained from the appropriate Bézier function 
related to the current stress state.  The uniaxial yield stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst can be deﬁned as 
a yield stress curve, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1, or a yield stress surface, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|parenriµhtCv1, with LCID. In

This is Material Type 136_2017, a plane stress orth otropic material model for metal 
forming.  It features the advanced Vegter yield loc us based on the interpolation by 
second-order Bezier curves.  Model parameters are d etermined from uniaxial test data 
at 0°, 45° and 90° to the rolling direction.  There fore, the same mechanical tests must be 
carried out as for Hill’s 1948 planar anisotropic m aterial model.  For a more detailed 
description of the yield locus, please see Vegter a nd Boogaard [2006].  The relationships 
between the results of uniaxial testing and the adv anced yield locus are introduced and 
discussed in Abspoel et al [2017].
