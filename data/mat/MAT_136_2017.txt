Type A F F F  F F F 
 
 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Material density 
E Elastic Young’s modulus 
PR Poisson’s ratio 
FBI Normalized yield stress |u1D7≠∆/˙.st |iCst  for equi- biaxial test.  If this value is 
not deﬁned in the input, it wi ll be approximated based on the 
uniaxial test result. 
RBI0 Strain ratio |u1D7≠∆/˙.st |iCst (0 °)=|u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst(0 °)/|u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst(0 °) for equi- biaxial test in the 
rolling direction.  If this value is not deﬁned in the input, it will be 
approximated based on the uniaxial test result. 
LCID Load curve ID or Table ID.  If deﬁned, SYS, SIP, SH S, SHL, ESH, 
E0, DYS, RATEN, SRN0, and EXSR are ignored. 
Load Curve.   When LCID is a load curve ID, it is taken as 
deﬁning eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀective p lastic strain.  
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the stress as a function eﬀect ive plastic strain 
for that strain rate.    Linear interpolation betwe en the discrete 
strain rates is used by default. 
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   A way to invoke logarithmic 
interpolation between discrete strain rates is desc ribed as follows.  
If the ﬁrst  value in the table is negative, LS-DY NA assumes that 
all the table values represent the natural logarith m of a strain rate.  
There is some addit ional computational cost associated with 
invoking logarithmic interpolation.

vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
