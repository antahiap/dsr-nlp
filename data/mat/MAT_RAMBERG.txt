Remarks: 
The Ramberg-Osgood equation is an empirical constit utive relation to represent the 
one-dimensional elastic-plastic behavior of many ma terials, including soils.  This model 
allows a simple rate independent representation of the hysteretic energy dissipation 
observed in soils subjected to cyclic shear deforma tion.  For monotonic loading, the 
stress-strain relationship is given by:  
|u1D6F∆
|u1D6F∆|u1D466Cst=/u1D̅0F
/u1D̅0F|u1D466Cst+ |u1D6F+/ℂiβiℂes.β6/u1D̅0F
/u1D̅0F|u1D466Cst/ℂiβiℂes.β6|u1D4JFCst
         for |u1D6F∆ ≥ 0
|u1D6F∆
|u1D6F∆|u1D466Cst=/u1D̅0F
/u1D̅0F|u1D466Cst− |u1D6F+/ℂiβiℂes.β6/u1D̅0F
/u1D̅0F|u1D466Cst/ℂiβiℂes.β6|u1D4JFCst
     for |u1D6F∆ < 0 
where |u1D6F∆ is the shear and /u1D̅0F is the stress.  The model approaches perfect plast icity as the 
stress exponent |u1D4JF→∞ .  These equations must be augmented to correctly m odel *. -OSGOOD  
 unloading and reloading material behavior.  The ﬁrs t load reversal is detected by |u1D6F∆|u1D6F∆̇<
0.  After the ﬁrst reversal, the stress-strain relat ionship is modiﬁed to

    for |u1D6F∆ < 0 
where |u1D6F∆|zeroCst and /u1D̅0F|zeroCst represent the values of strain and stress at the p oint of load reversal.  
Subsequent load reversals are detected by (|u1D6F∆ − |u1D6F∆|zeroCst)|u1D6F∆̇< 0. 
The Ramberg-Osgood equations are inherently one-dim ensional and are assumed to 
apply to shear components.  To generalize this theo ry to the multidimensional case, it is 
assumed that each component of the deviatoric stres s and deviatoric tensorial strain is 
independently related by the one-dimensional stress -strain equations.  A projection is 
used to map the result back into deviatoric stress space if required.  The volumetric 
behavior is elastic, and, therefore, the pressure p  is found by 
|u1D4JD = −|u1D43∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst 
where |u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst is the volumetric strain. *
