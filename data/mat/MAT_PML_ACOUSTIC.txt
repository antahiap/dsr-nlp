This is  Material Type 231.  This is a perfectly-matched lay er (PML) material — an 
absorbing layer material used to simulate wave prop agation in an unbounded acoustic 
medium — and can be used only with the acoustic pre ssure element formulation 
(element type 14).  This material implements the th ree-dimensional version of the Basu-
Chopra PML for anti-plane motion [Basu and Chopra ( 2003,2004), Basu (2009)].

Remarks: 
1.  Unboundedness.  A layer of this material may be placed at a boundar y of a 
bounded domain to simulate unboundedness of the dom ain at that boundary: 
the layer absorbs and attenuates waves propagating outward from the domain, 
without any signiﬁcant reﬂection of the waves back into the bounded domain.  
The layer cannot support any hydrostatic pressure. 
2.  Material in Bounded Domain.   It is assumed the material in the bounded 
domain near the layer is an acoustic material.  The  material properties of the 
layer should be set to the corresponding properties  of this material.  
3.  Layer Geometry.   The layer should form a cuboid box around the bou nded 
domain, with the axes of the box aligned with the c oordinate axes.  Various 
faces of this box may be open, as required by the g eometry of the problem, e.g., 
for a half-space problem, the “top” of the box shou ld be open. *.   
 Internally, LS-DYNA will partition the entire PML i nto regions which form the 
“faces,” “edges” and “corners” of the above cuboid box, and generate a new 
material for each region.  This partitioning will b e visible in the d3plot ﬁle.  The 
user may safely ignore this partitioning. 
4.  Number of Elements in Layer.   The layer should have 5 - 10 elements through 
its depth.  Typically, 5 - 6 elements are suﬃcient if the excitation source is rea- 
sonably distant from the layer, and 8 - 10 elements  if it is close.  The size of the 
elements should be similar to that of elements in t he bounded domain near the 
layer, and should be small enough to suﬃciently dis cretize all signiﬁcant 
wavelengths in the problem. 
5.  Nodal Constraints.   The nodes on the outer boundary of the layer shou ld be 
fully constrained.  
6.  Pressure Values.  The pressure values reported by this material do no t have 
any physical signiﬁcance. *
