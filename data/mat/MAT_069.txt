LCIDF Load curve number ID deﬁning force as a function of  piston 
displacement, |u1D46≠, that is, term |u1D4J3 (|u1D46≠ + |u1D46≠|zeroCst). Compressive behavior is 
deﬁned in the positive quadrant of the force displa cement curve.  
Displacements falling outside of the deﬁned force d isplacement 
curve are extrapolated.  Care must be taken to ensu re that 
extrapolated values are reasonable. 
LCIDD Load curve number ID deﬁning damping coeﬃcient as a  function 
of piston displacement, |u1D46≠, that is, |u1D4J4(|u1D46≠ + |u1D46≠|zeroCst).  Displacements falling 
outside the deﬁned curve are extrapolated.  Care mu st be taken to 
ensure that extrapolated values are reasonable. 
S0 Initial displacement, |u1D46≠|zeroCst; typically set to zero.  A positive 
displacement corresponds to compressive behavior.

 Remarks: 
As the damper moves, the ﬂuid ﬂows through the open  oriﬁces to provide the 
necessary damping resistance.  While moving as show n in Figure M69-1 , the piston 
gradually blocks oﬀ and eﬀectively closes the oriﬁc es.  The number of oriﬁces and the 
size of their opening control the damper resistance  and performance.  The damping 
force is computed from,

In the implementation, the oriﬁces are assumed to b e circular with partial covering by 
the oriﬁce controller.  As the piston closes, the c losure of the oriﬁce is gradual.  This 
gradual closure is properly taken into account to i nsure a smooth response.  If the 
piston stroke is exceeded, the stiﬀness value, /u1D458, limits further movement, meaning if the 
damper bottoms out in tension or compression the da mper forces are calculated by 
replacing the damper by a bottoming out spring and damper, /u1D458 and /u1D450, respectively.  The 
piston stroke must exceed the initial length of the  beam element.  The time step 
calculation is based in part on the stiﬀness value of the bottoming out spring.  A typical DISPLACEMENTF
