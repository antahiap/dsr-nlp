In general, with 
|u1D43A =|u1D438
2(1 +/u1D̅08),      |u1D43∆ =|u1D438
3(1 − 2/u1D̅08) 
in *. COELASTIC, we have 
|u1D43A = |summationCv1 |u1D43A/u1D4:C.st,         |u1D43∆ = |summationCv1 |u1D43∆/u1D4:C.st 
while the weights are given as 
|u1D464/u1D4:C.st=|u1D43A/u1D4:C.st
|u1D43A=|u1D43∆/u1D4:C.st
|u1D43∆ 
which implies that the add inelasticity approach is  somewhat more restrictive than the 
general approach.  However, an almost pure shear/bu lk link can be created by setting 
the bulk/shear decay coeﬃcient to a very large numb er compared to the simulation 
time.  To be speciﬁc, to get a shear link set |u1D6FD/u1D4:E.st≫1/|u1D447 and to get a bulk link set |u1D6FD/u1D4:A.st≫1/
|u1D447, where |u1D447 is the termination time.  See also VFLAG in *. COELASTIC 
for a more general formulation.

MOISTURE 
This is Material Type 76.  This material model prov ides a general viscoelastic Maxwell 
model having up to 18 terms in the Prony series exp ansion and is useful for modeling 
dense continuum rubbers and solid explosives.  Eith er the coeﬃcients of the Prony 
series expansion or a relaxation curve may be speci ﬁed to deﬁne the viscoelastic 
deviatoric and bulk behavior. 
The material model can also be used with laminated shells.  Either an elastic or 
viscoelastic layer can be deﬁned with the laminated  formulation.  To activate laminated 
shells, you must set the laminated formulation ﬂag on *CONTROL_SHELL. With the 
laminated option you must also deﬁne an integration  rule.  The addition of an elastic or 
viscoelastic layer was implemented by Professor Ala  Tabiei, and the laminated shells 
feature was developed and implemented by Professor Ala Tabiei.

 where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst(|u1D461Cst−/u1D̅0F.st) is the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent stres s measures.  This stress is 
added to the stress tensor determined from the stra in energy functional. 
 
If we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, the relaxation function is represented by 
18 terms from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
We characterize this in the input by shear moduli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and decay constants, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.  An 
arbitrary number of terms, up to 18, may be used wh en applying the viscoelastic model. 
 
For volumetric relaxation, the relaxation function is also represented by the Prony series 
in terms of bulk moduli: 
/u1D458(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43∆|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J8Csts/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
The Arrhenius and Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) shift  functions account for the eﬀects 
of the temperature on the stress relaxation.  A sca led time, |u1D461|minuteCst, 
|u1D461′=/integral.v:Φ(|u1D447)|u1D4J1|u1D461 |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst 
is used in the relaxation function instead of the p hysical time.  The Arrhenius shift 
function is 
Φ(|u1D447) = exp |<racketleftCvJ−|u1D434 |parenleftCvJ1
|u1D447−1
|u1D447REF |parenriµhtCvJ|<racketriµhtCvJ 
and the Williams-Landel-Ferry shift function is 
Φ(|u1D447) = exp |parenleftCvJ−|u1D434|u1D447 − |u1D447REF 
|u1D43J + |u1D447 − |u1D447REF |parenriµhtCvJ 
If all three values (TREF, A, and B) are nonzero, t he WLF function is used; the 
Arrhenius function is used if B is zero; and no sca ling is applied if all three values are 
zero. 
 
The moisture model allows the scaling of the materi al properties as a function of the 
moisture content of the material.  The shear and bu lk moduli are scaled by  |u1D6F+, the decay 
constants are scaled by |u1D6FD, and a moisture strain, |u1D6F∆(|u1D44≠)[|u1D44≠ − |u1D44≠/u1D442.st] is introduced 
analogous to the thermal strain. *. COELASTIC. -0.08-0.05-0.030.000.020.050.07

Here |u1D6F+(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) and |u1D6FD(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) are two new material properties that are functions  of the aging 
time |u1D461|u1D44∆Cst.  The material properties functions |u1D6F+(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) and |u1D6FD(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) will be determined using 
experimental results.  For determination of |u1D6F+(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) and |u1D6FD(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst), the above equations can be 
written in the following form 
log|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst − |u1D4JD|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenriµhtCv2|u1D461Cst|u1D44∆Csts/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D461Cst= log |u1D6F+(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) + log|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst − |u1D4JD|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenriµhtCv2|u1D461Cst|u1D44∆Csts=|zeroCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D461Cst→/u1Dℜ09.st
log /u1D̅0∫= log |u1D6FD(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) + log |u1D461 
Therefore, if one plots the stress as a function of  time on log-log scales, with the vertical 
axis being the stress and the horizontal axis being  the time, then the stress-relaxation 
curve for any aged time history can be obtained dir ectly from the stress-relaxation curve 
at |u1D461|u1D44∆Cst= 0 by imposing a vertical shift and a horizontal shif t on the stress-relaxation 
curves.  The vertical shift and the horizontal shif t are log |u1D6F+(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) and log |u1D6FD(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) respectively. *. -
