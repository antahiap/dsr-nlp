The UNIAXIAL keyword option causes the transverse s tresses and transverse strains to 
be zero for solid spot welds.  The older uniaxial m ethod, invoked with E < 0.0 on 
Card 1, assumed only the transverse stresses are ze ro.  Compared to the older method, 
the UNIAXIAL keyword option increases the stability  of the solver.  See Remark 2  for

 2.  Loading Solid Welds Uniaxially.   We have implemented two methods of 
loading solid and solid weld assemblies uniaxially.   The older method is in- 
voked by deﬁning the elastic modulus, |u1D438, as a negative number where the ab- 
solute value of |u1D438 is the desired value for |u1D438.  This uniaxial option causes the two 
transverse stress terms to be assumed to be zero th roughout the calculation.  
This assumption eliminates parasitic transverse str ess that causes slow growth 
of plastic strain-based damage.  
The other method is invoked by setting OPTION2  to UNIAXIAL. This method 
is preferred.  It causes the two transverse stress terms and the two transverse 
strains terms to be set to zero.  It was added beca use we found that the older 
method sometimes induced spurious oscillations in t he axial force, leading to 
premature failure.  
The motivation for the uniaxial options can be expl ained with a weld loaded in 
tension.  Due to Poisson’s eﬀect, an element in ten sion would be expected to 
contract in the transverse directions.  However, be cause the weld nodes are 
constrained to the mid-plane of shell elements, suc h contraction is only possi- 
ble to the degree that the shell element contracts.   In other words, the uniaxial 
stress state cannot be represented by the weld.  Fo r plastic strain-based dam- 
age, this eﬀect can be particularly apparent as it causes tensile stress to contin- 
ue to grow very large as the stress state becomes v ery nearly triaxial tension.  
In this stress state, plastic strain grows very slo wly so it appears that damage 
calculation is failing to knock down the stress.  B y simply assuming that the 
transverse stresses are zero, the plastic strain gr ows as expected and damage is 
much more eﬀective. 
3.  NF.   NF speciﬁes the number of terms used to ﬁlter the  stresses or resultants 
used in the OPT failure criterion.  NF cannot excee d 30.  The default value is set 
to zero which is generally recommended unless oscil latory resultant forces are 
observed in the time history databases.  Although w elds should not oscillate 
signiﬁcantly, this option was added for consistency  with the other spot weld 
options.  NF aﬀects the storage since it is necessa ry to store the resultant forces 
as history variables.  The NF parameter is availabl e only for beam element 
welds. 
4.  Time Scaling.   The inertias of the spot welds are scaled during the ﬁrst time 
step so that their stable time step size is ∆|u1D461.  A strong compressive load on the 
spot weld at a later time may reduce the length of the spot weld so that stable 
time step size drops below ∆|u1D461. If the value of ∆|u1D461 is zero, mass scaling is not per- 
formed, and the spot welds will probably limit the time step size.  Under most 
circumstances, the inertias of the spot welds are s mall enough that scaling 
them will have a negligible eﬀect on the structural  response and the use of this 
option is encouraged. *.   
 where |u1D461failure  is the time at which damage initiates, and |u1D461rupture = RS .  For 
DMGOPT = 2, |u1D461failure  is set equal to the time at which |u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst exceeds EFAIL.  
For DMGOPT = 12,  |u1D461failure  is set equal to either the time when |u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst exceeds 
EFAIL or the time when the failure criterion is met , whichever occurs ﬁrst. 
If DMGOPT = 0, 1, or 2, inputting EFAIL = 0 will ca use damage to initiate as 
soon as the weld stress reaches the yield surface.  Prior to version 9.1, inputting 
EFAIL = 0 for DMGOPT = 10, 11, 12 would similarly c ause damage to initiate 
when the stress state reaches the yield surface, bu t version 9.1 and later will 
ignore EFAIL = 0 and only initiate damage when the failure criterion is met.  If 
the eﬀective plastic strain is zero when damage ini tiates by the failure criterion, 
then the yield stress of the weld is reduced to the  current eﬀective stress so that 
the stress state is on the yield surface and plasti c strain can start to grow. 
For DMGOPT = 1, the damage behavior is the same as for DMGOPT = 0, but 
an additional damage variable is calculated to prev ent stress growth during 
softening.  Similarly, DMGOPT = 11 behaves like DMG OPT = 10 except for the 
additional damage variable.  This additional functi on is also used with DM-
GOPT = 2 and 12.  The eﬀect of this additional dama ge function is noticed only 
in brick and brick assembly welds in tension loadin g where it prevents growth 
of the tensile force in the weld after damage initi ates.  
For DMGOPT = 10, 11, or 12 an optional FMODE parame ter determines 
whether a weld that reaches the failure surface wil l fail immediately or initiate 
damage.  The failure surface calculation has shear terms, which may include 
the torsional moment as well as normal and bending terms.   If FMODE is in- 
put with a value between 0 and 1, then when the fai lure surface is reached, the 
sum of the square of the shear terms is divided by the sum of the square of all 
terms.  If this ratio exceeds FMODE, then the weld will fail immediately.  If the 
ratio is less than or equal to FMODE, then damage w ill initiate.  The FMODE 
option is available only for brick and brick assemb ly welds.  
For resultant based failure (OPT = -1 or 0) and DMG OPT = 10, 11, or 12 an op- 
tional FFCAP parameter determines whether a weld th at reaches the failure 
surface will fail immediately.  After damage initia tion, the failure function can 
reach values above 1.0. This can now be limited by the FFCAP value (should be 
larger than 1.0):

The stresses are calculated for all directions, 0 °≤/u1D̅01≤90 °, in order to ﬁnd the 
maximum.  
OPT = 10 
OPT = 10 invokes the failure criterion developed by  Lee and Balur (2011).  It is available 
for welds modeled by beam elements, solid elements,  or solid assemblies.  A detailed 
discussion of the criterion is given in the user’s manual section for *DEFINE_-
SPOTWELD_FAILURE. 
OPT = 11 
OPT = 11 invokes a resultant force based failure cr iterion for beams.  With correspond- 
ing load curves or tables LCT and LCC, resultant fo rce at failure |u1D439/u1D45:.st|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J9Cst  can be deﬁned as 
function of loading direction |u1D6F∆ (curve) or loading direction |u1D6F∆ and eﬀective strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇ 
(table): 
|u1D439fail = |u1D4J3 (|u1D6F∆)      or     |u1D439fail = |u1D4J3 (|u1D6F∆, |u1D7≠≠̇)

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
E Young’s modulus.   
LT.0.0:  |E| is the Young’s modulus.  E < 0 invokes uniaxial 
stress for solid spot welds with the transverse str esses 
assumed to be zero.  See Remark 1 . This is for when the 
keyword option is unset (<BLANK>) only. 
PR Poisson’s ratio 
DT Time step size for mass scaling, ∆|u1D461 
TFAIL Failure time if nonzero.  If zero, this optio n is ignored. 
EFAIL Eﬀective plastic strain in weld material at f ailure.  See Remark 2 . 
NF Number of failure function evaluations stored for ﬁ ltering by time 
averaging.  The default value is set to zero which is generally 
recommended unless oscillatory resultant forces are  observed in 
the time history databases.  Even though these weld s should not 
oscillate signiﬁcantly, this option was added for c onsistency with 
the other spot weld options.  NF aﬀects the storage  since it is 
necessary to store the failure terms.  When NF is n onzero, the 
resultants in the output databases are ﬁltered.  NF cannot exceed 
30. *. _DA  
 constrained to the mid-plane of shell elements, suc h contraction is only possi- 
ble to the degree that the shell element contracts.   In other words, the uniaxial 
stress state cannot be represented by the weld.  Fo r plastic strain-based dam- 
age, this eﬀect can be particularly apparent as it causes tensile stress to contin- 
ue to grow very large as the stress state becomes v ery nearly triaxial tension.  
In this stress state, plastic strain grows very slo wly so it appears that damage 
calculation is failing to knock down the stress.  B y simply assuming that the 
transverse stresses are zero, the plastic strain gr ows as expected and damage is 
much more eﬀective 
2.  Connection Properties.  This weld material is modeled with isotropic 
hardening plasticity.  The yield stress and constan t hardening modulus are 
assumed to be those of the welded shell elements as  deﬁned in a *DEFINE_-
CONNECTION_PROPERTIES table.  *DEFINE_CONNECTION_PR OPERTIES 
data also deﬁne a failure function and the damage t ype.  The interpretation of 
EFAIL and RS is determined by the choice of damage type.  This is discussed in 
Remark 4 on *DEFINE_CONNECTION_PROPERTIES. 
3.  Solid Weld Element Thickness.  Solid weld elements are tied to the mid-plane 
of shell materials and so typically have a thicknes s that is half the sum of the 
thicknesses of the welded shell sections.  As a res ult, a weld under shear load- 
ing can be subject to an artiﬁcially large moment w hich will be balanced by 
normal forces transferred through the tied contact.   These normal forces will 
cause the normal term in the failure calculation to  be artiﬁcially high.  Input- 
ting a TRUE_T that is smaller than the modeled thic kness, for example, 10%-
30% of true thickness will scale down the normal fo rce that results from the 
balancing moment and provide more realistic failure  calculations.  TRUE_T 
eﬀects only the failure calculation, not the weld e lement behavior.  If TRUE_-
T = 0 or data is omitted, the modeled weld element thickness is used. 
4.  Weld Assembly Failure.  For weld elements in an assembly (see RPBHX on 
*CONTROL_SPOTWELD_BEAM or *DEFINE_HEX_SPOTWELD_ASSE M-
BLY), the failure criterion is evaluated using the assembly cross section.  If 
damage is not active, all elements will be deleted when the failure criterion is 
met.  If damage is active, then damage is calculate d independently in each 
element of the assembly.  By default, elements of t he assembly are deleted as 
damage in each element is complete.  If ASFF = 1, t hen failure and deletion of 
all elements in the assembly will occur simultaneou sly when damage is com- 
plete in any one of the elements.
