This is Thermal Material Type 10.  With this model,  isotropic thermal properties that are 
dependent on temperature (and/or mechanical history  variables) can be speciﬁed with 
load curves.  The properties must be deﬁned for the  temperature (and/or history 
variable) range that the material will see in the a nalysis.
