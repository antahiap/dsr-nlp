This is Material Type 276.  This material model pro vides a general viscoelastic Maxwell 
model having up to 6 terms in the Prony series expa nsion and is useful for modeling 
dense continuum rubbers and solid explosives.  It i s similar to Material Type 76 but 
allows the incorporation of aging eﬀects on the mat erial properties.  Either the 
coeﬃcients of the Prony series expansion or a relax ation curve may be speciﬁed to 
deﬁne the viscoelastic deviatoric and bulk behavior . 
The material model can also be used with laminated shell with either an elastic or 
viscoelastic layer.  To activate the laminated shel l set the formulation ﬂag on *CON-
TROL_SHELL. With the laminated option a user deﬁned  integration rule is needed.

Viscoelastic Constant Cards.   Up to 12 cards may be input.  The next keyword (“*” ) 
card terminates this input.  These cards are not ne eded if relaxation data is deﬁned.  The 
number of terms for the shear behavior may diﬀer fr om that for the bulk behavior: 
simply insert zero if a term is not included.  If a n elastic layer is deﬁned, only G i and K i 
need to be deﬁned (note in an elastic layer only on e card is needed).

MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label n ot exceeding 8 
characters must be speciﬁed. 
RO Mass density 
BULK Elastic bulk modulus 
PCF Tensile pressure elimination ﬂag for solid elements  only.  If set to 
unity, tensile pressures are set to zero. 
EF Elastic ﬂag: 
EQ.0:  layer is viscoelastic. 
EQ.1:  layer is elastic. 
TREF Reference temperature for shift function (must be g reater than 
zero) 
A Chronological coeﬃcient |u1D6F+(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst).  See Remarks below. 
B Chronological coeﬃcient |u1D6FD(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst).  See Remarks below. 
LCID Load curve ID for deviatoric behavior if const ants, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst and |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst, are 
determined using a least squares ﬁt.  See Figure M76-1  for an 
example relaxation curve. 
NT Number of terms in shear ﬁt.  The default is 6.  Fe wer than NT 
terms will be used if the ﬁt produces one or more n egative shear 
moduli.  Currently, the maximum number is 6. 
BSTART In the ﬁt, |u1D6FD|oneCst is set to zero, |u1D6FD|twoCst is set to BSTART, |u1D6FD|threeCst is 10 times |u1D6FD|twoCst, 
|u1D6FD|fourCst is 10 times |u1D6FD|threeCst , and so on.  If zero, BSTART is determined by an 
iterative trial and error scheme. 
TRAMP Optional ramp time for loading 
LCIDK Load curve ID for bulk behavior if constants,  |u1D43∆|u1D4J6Cst, and |u1D6FD/u1D4:E.st|u1D4J6Cst are 
determined via a least squares ﬁt.  See Figure M76-1  for an 
example relaxation curve. 
NTK Number of terms desired in bulk ﬁt.  The default is  6.  Currently, 
the maximum number is 6. 
BSTARTK In the ﬁt, |u1D6FD/u1D4:E.st|oneCsts is set to zero, |u1D6FD/u1D4:E.st|twoCsts is set to BSTARTK, |u1D6FD/u1D4:E.st|threeCsts is 10 times 
|u1D6FD/u1D4:E.st|twoCst, |u1D6FD/u1D4:E.st/four.sts is 10 times |u1D6FD/u1D4:E.st|threeCsts, and so on.  If zero, BSTARTK is *
