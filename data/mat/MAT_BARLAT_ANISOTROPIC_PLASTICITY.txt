NATE_ NODES, and then, for shells only, rotated about 
the shell element normal by an angle BETA 
EQ.1.0: locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y a 
point in space and the global location of the eleme nt 
center, this is the |u1D44∆-direction. This option is for solid el- 
ements only. 
EQ.2.0: globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR 
EQ.3.0: locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
oﬀsetting the material axes by an angle, BE TA, from a 
line determined by taking the cross product of the vec- 
tor /u1D42F with the normal to the plane of the element 
EQ.4.0: locally orthotropic in cylindrical coor dinate system 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D4JD, which deﬁne the centerline axis.  
This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: the absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR). 
BETA Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 1 (shells only) and 
AOPT = 3, may be overridden on the element card, se e *ELE-
MENT_SHELL_BETA or *ELEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO. 
MACF Material axes change ﬂag for brick elements: 
EQ.1: no change (default) 
EQ.2: switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F, 
EQ.3: switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450, 
EQ.4: switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450.
