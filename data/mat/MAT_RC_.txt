This is Material Type 174, for Hughes-Liu beam elem ents only.  The material model can 
represent plain concrete only, reinforcing steel on ly, or a smeared combination of 
concrete and reinforcement.  The main emphasis of t his material model is the cyclic 
behavior – it is intended primarily for seismic ana lysis.

Concrete: 
In monotonic compression, the approach of Park and Kent, as described in Park & 
Paulay [1975] is used.  The material follows a para bolic stress-strain curve up to a 
maximum stress equal to the cylinder strength FC; t herafter the strength decays linearly 
with strain until the residual strength is reached.   Default values for some material 
parameters will be calculated automatically as foll ows: 
EC50 =(3 + 0.2 9|u1D439|u1D436)

where FC is in MPa as per Park and Kent test data. 
ESOFT = E U NL 
User-deﬁned values higher than EUNL are not permitt ed. 
 
UNITC is used only to calculate default values for the above parameters from FC. 
 
Strain-softening behavior tends to lead to deformat ions being concentrated in one 
element, and hence the overall force-deﬂection beha vior of the structure can be mesh-
size-dependent if the softening is characterized by  strain.  To avoid this, a characteristic 
length (LCHAR) may be deﬁned.  This is the length o f specimen (or element) that 
would exhibit the deﬁned monotonic stress-strain re lationship.  LS-DYNA adjusts the 
stress-strain relationship after ultimate load for each element, such that all elements 
irrespective of their length will show the same deﬂ ection during strain softening (i.e. *. BEAM  
 between ultimate load and residual load).  Therefor e, although deformation will still be 
concentrated in one element, the load-deﬂection beh avior should be the same 
irrespective of element size.  For tensile behavior , ESOFT is similarly scaled. 
 
 
 
Cyclic behavior is broadly suggested by Blakeley an d Park [1973] as described in Park & 
Paulay [1975]; the stress-strain response lies with in the Park-Kent envelope, and is 
characterized by stiﬀ initial unloading response at  slope EUNL followed by a less stiﬀ 
response if it unloads to less than half the curren t strength.  Reloading stiﬀness 
degrades with increasing strain. 
 
In tension, the stress rises linearly with strain u ntil a tensile limit FT is reached.  
Thereafter the stiﬀness and strength decays with in creasing strain at a rate ESOFT. The 
stiﬀness also decays such that unloading always ret urns to strain at which the stress 
most recently changed to tensile.

 where |u1D7≠≠ and |u1D7≠∆ are strain and stress, |u1D7≠≠|u1D46≠Cst is the strain at zero stress, E is Young’s Modulus, 
and r and |u1D7≠∆/u1D4:6.st |u1D43BCst  are as deﬁned below  
 
Two options are given for calculation r and |u1D7≠∆/u1D4:6.st |u1D43BCst , which is performed at each stress 
reversal: 
1.  If RREINF is input as -1, r and σCH  are calculated internally from formulae 
given in Kent and Park.  Parameter r depends on the  number of stress rever- 
sals.  Parameter |u1D7≠∆/u1D4:6.st |u1D43BCst  depends on the plastic strain that occurred betwee n the 
previous two stress reversals.  The formulae were s tatistically derived from 
experiments, but may not ﬁt all circumstances.  In particular, large diﬀerences 
in behavior may be caused by the presence or absenc e of small stress reversals 
such as could be caused by high frequency oscillati ons.  Therefore, results 
might sometimes be unduly sensitive to small change s in the input data. 
2.  If RREINF is entered by the user or left blank, r is held constant while |u1D7≠∆/u1D4:6.st |u1D43BCst  is 
calculated on each reversal such that the Ramberg-O sgood curve meets the 
monotonic stress-strain curve at the point from whi ch it last unloaded, e.g. 
points 6 and 8 are coincident in the graph below.  The default setting RRE-
INF = 4.0 gives similar hysteresis behavior to that  described by Kent & Park 
but is unlikely to be so sensitive to small changes  of input data.

It is recommended to use BEAMIP on *DATABASE_EXTENT _BINARY to request stress

Purpose:  This is Material Type 194. It is for shel l elements only.  It uses empirically-
derived algorithms to model the eﬀect of cyclic she ar loading on reinforced concrete 
walls.  It is primarily intended for modeling squat  shear walls, but can also be used for 
slabs.  Because the combined eﬀect of concrete and reinforcement is included in the 
empirical data, crude meshes can be used.  The mode l has been designed such that the 
minimum amount of input is needed: generally, only the variables on the ﬁrst card need 
to be deﬁned. 
NOTE:  This material does not support speciﬁcation of a m a- 
terial angle, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst, for each through-thickness integra- 
tion point of a shell.

UCONV Unit conversion factor.  UCONV is expected to  be set such that, 
U CON V =/radical.v11.0 PSI  in the model 's stress units . 
This used to convert the ultimate tensile stress of  concrete which 
is expressed as /radical.v1FC  where FC is given in PSI. Therefore a unit 
conversion factor of /radical.v1PSI Stress U nit ⁄ is required.  Examples: 
UCONV = 83.3 = /radical.v16 894  if stress unit is N/m|twoCst 
UCONV = 0.083 if stress unit is MN /m|twoCst or N/mm |twoCst  
ALPHA Shear span factor - see below. 
FT Cracking stress in direct tension - see notes below.  Default is 8% 
of the cylinder strength. 
ERIENF Young’s Modulus of reinforcement.  Used in c alculation of post-
cracked stiﬀness - see notes below.

F Strength degradation factor.  After the ultimate sh ear stress has 
been achieved, F multiplies the maximum shear stres s from t he 
curve for subsequent reloading.  F = 1.0 implies no strength 
degradation (default).  F = 0.5 implies that the strength is halved 
for subsequent reloading.

 plane shear stress component.  It is not recommende d that this model be used where 
nonlinear response to direct compressive or loads i s important. 
 
Note that the in-plane shear stress |u1D461|u1D46JCst|u1D466Cst  is deﬁned as the shear stress in the element’s loc al 
|u1D46J-|u1D466 plane.  This is not necessarily equal to the maxim um shear stress in the plane: for 
example, if the principal stresses are at 45 degree s to the local axes, |u1D461|u1D46JCst|u1D466Cst  is zero.  
Therefore it is important to ensure that the local axes are appropriate - for a shear wall 
the local axes should be vertical or horizontal.  B y default, local |u1D46J points from node 1 to 
node 2 of the element.  It is possible to change th e local axes by using AOPT > 0. 
 
If TMAX is set to zero, the ultimate shear stress i s calculated using a formula in the 
Uniform Building Code 1997, section 1921.6.5: 
TMAX U BC =U CON V × ALP H A ×/radical.v1FC + RO × F Y  
where, 
U CON V = unit con v ersion factor, see v arria b le list 
ALP H A = aspect ratio 
= 2.0 for ℎ/u1D45∫⁄∈(2.0,∞) increases linearly to 3.0 for ℎ/u1D45∫⁄∈(2.0,1.5) 
FC = unconfined compressi v e strength of concrete 
RO = fraction of reinforcement 
= |parenleftCv1percent reinforcement|parenriµhtCv1 100 ⁄
F Y = yield stress of reinforcement   
To this we add shear stress due to the overburden t o obtain the ultimate shear stress: 
TMAX U BC = TMAX U BC + SIG0 
where 
SIG0 = in plane compressi v e stress under static e q uili b rium conditions 
 
The UBC formula for ultimate shear stress is genera lly conservative (predicts that the 
wall is weaker than shown in test), sometimes by 50 % or more.  A less conservative 
formula is that of Fukuzawa: 
TMAX = max |<racketleftCvJ|parenleftCvJ0.4 +|u1D434|u1D4J≠Cst

 1.  Pre-cracking, linear elastic response is assumed u sing the overall Young’s 
Modulus on Card 1. 
2.  Cracking occurs in the local x or y directions when  the tensile stress in that 
direction exceeds the concrete tensile strength FT (if not input on Card 2, this 
defaults to 8% of the compressive strength FC).  Po st-cracking, a linear stress-
strain response is assumed up to reinforcement yiel d at a strain deﬁned by 
reinforcement yield stress divided by reinforcement  Young’s Modulus. 
3.  Post-yield, a constant stress is assumed (no work hardening). 
Unloading returns to the origin of the stress-strai n curve.  
For compressive strains the response is always line ar elastic using the overall 
Young’s Modulus on Card 1. 
If insuﬃcient data is entered, no cracking occurs i n the model.  As a minimum, 
FC and FY are needed. 
Extra variables are available for post-processing a s follows: 
Extra variable 1: Current engineering shear strain 
Extra variable 2: Shear status:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5– see below 
Extra variable 3: Maximum direct strain so far in l ocal |u1D46J direction (for ten- 
sile cracking) 
Extra variable 4: Maximum direct strain so far in l ocal |u1D466 direction (for ten- 
sile cracking)  
Extra variable 5: Tensile status: 0, 1 or 2 = elast ic, cracked, or yielded re- 
spectively. 
The shear status shows how far along the shear stre ss-strain curve each element 
has progressed, e.g. status 2 means that the elemen t has passed the second 
point on the curve.  These status levels correspond  to performance criteria in 
building design codes such as FEMA. *
