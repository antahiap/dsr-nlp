Figure M2-2  indicates when LS-DY NA applies MACF during the 
process to obtain the ﬁnal material axes.  If BETA on *ELE-
MENT_SOLID_ {OPTION} is deﬁned, then that BE TA is used for 
the rotation for all AOPT options.  Otherwise, if A OPT = 3, the 
BETA input on Card 3 rotates the axes.  For all other values of 
AOPT, the material axes will be switched as speciﬁe d by MACF, 
but no BETA rotation will be performed.

Inﬁnitesimal description 
 
The inelasticity feature assumes that the strain or  strain rate is somehow decomposed 
into an elastic and inelastic part.  This decomposi tion is in general not trivial and 
depends upon the underlying material model, but to make things simple we can begin 
by restricting ourselves to a small deformation con text.  In this case the decomposition 
is additive , so 
/u1D̅:A=/u1D̅:A|u1D4J2Cst+/u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst  , 
where /u1D̅:A is the total  (given) strain, /u1D̅:A|u1D4J2Cst is the elastic  strain, and /u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst is the inelastic  strain.  A 
material model then amounts to determining the stre ss for the elastic strain, which can 
be written as 
/u1D̅48=/u1D̅48(/u1D̅:A|u1D4J2Cst) =/u1D̅48(/u1D̅:A−/u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst). 
The material model used as a basis for this feature , that is, the model indicated by 
parameter MID above, here acts as the function /u1D̅48(∗). If no inelasticity is added to the 
model, /u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst=/u1D̅CE and the stress will be given by /u1D̅48(/u1D̅:A). It is simply a plain evaluation of the 
material model in the absence of this keyword.  For  linear elasticity, for instance, the 
function would be given by Hooke’s law 
/u1D̅48(/u1D̅:A) =/u1D46A/u1D̅:A  , 
where /u1D46A is the Hooke elasticity tensor.  Needless to say, the material model itself can 
deal with inelasticities of various kinds, such as plasticity, creep, thermal expansion and 
viscoelasticity, so the variable /u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst is restricted to the inelasticities speciﬁcally de ﬁned here ...

The current yield stress is deﬁned as

where the inelastic strain is represented by the pl astic strain, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, and /u1D450 is the curve or 
table used to evaluate the yield stress.  The evolu tion of plastic strain is given by the 
KKT condition

The Kirchhoﬀ stress for link /u1D4:C is obtained as /u1D̅4∫/u1D4:C.st=/u1D4∫5/u1D4:C.st−/u1D45E/u1D4:C.st/u1D4̅0. Here we use /u1D46D̅|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst=/u1D4:D|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst−|oneCst/|threeCst/u1D46D|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst, 
where /u1D4:D|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst= det /u1D46D|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst, and /u1D46D|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst is the deformation gradient between the conﬁgurati on at 
time |u1D46≠ and time |u1D461. For law #1, /u1D46D̅|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst is used to push the stress forward from time |u1D46≠ to time 
|u1D461, while for law #2, /u1D46D|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst is used to transform the stress from time |u1D46≠ to time |u1D461, both 
essential to preserve frame invariance. 
 
The decay coeﬃcients can be constants but can also dependent on the state of the 
system (stress, internal variables, temperature, et c.). Note that if the decay coeﬃcients 
are equal to zero ( |u1D6FD|u1D46≠Cst= |u1D6FD|u1D4JDCst= 0), this is equivalent to not having viscoelasticity .  
Currently, we can specify temperature dependent dec ay coeﬃcients to aﬀect both the 
deviatoric and volumetric stress, formalized in the  following. 
 
Viscoelasticity (LAW = 6) 
 
For viscoelasticity, the decay of stress is governe d by the decay coeﬃcients |u1D6FD|u1D46≠Cst and |u1D6FD|u1D4JDCst, 
optionally incorporating shift functions depending on the temperature |u1D447. In this 
implementation, the shear and bulk decay are given as 
|u1D6FD|u1D46≠Cst= |u1D6FD/u1D4:A.st/u1D̅1∫/u1D4:A.st(|u1D447)
|u1D6FD|u1D4JDCst= |u1D6FD/u1D4:E.st/u1D̅1∫/u1D4:E.st(|u1D447) 
where /u1D̅1∫∗ (∗ being |u1D43A or |u1D43∆) are shift functions given by
