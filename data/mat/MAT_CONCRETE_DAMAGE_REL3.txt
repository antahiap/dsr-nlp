This is Material Type 72R3. The Karagozian & Case ( K&C) Concrete Model - Release III 
is a three-invariant model, uses three shear failur e surfaces, includes damage and 
strain-rate eﬀects, and has origins based on the Ps eudo-TENSOR Model (Material Type 
16).  The most signiﬁcant user improvement provided  by Release III is a model 
parameter generation capability, based solely on th e unconﬁned compression strength 
of the concrete.  The implementation of Release III  signiﬁcantly changed the user input, 
thus previous input ﬁles using Material Type 72 pri or to LS-DYNA Version 971, are not 
compatible with the present input format. 
An open source reference, that precedes the paramet er generation capability, is 
provided in Malvar et al.  [1997].  A workshop proc eedings reference, Malvar et al.  
[1996], is useful, but may be diﬃcult to obtain.  M ore recent, but limited distribution  
reference materials, such as Malvar et al.  [2000],  may be obtained by contacting 
Karagozian & Case. 
Seven card images are required to deﬁne the complete  set of model parameters for the 
K&C Concrete Model.  An Equation-of-State is also r equired for the pressure-volume 
strain response.  Brief descriptions of all the inp ut parameters are provided below, 
however it is expected that this model will be used  primarily with the option to 
automatically generate the model parameters based o n the unconﬁned compression 
strength of the concrete.  These generated material  parameters, along with the 
generated parameters for *EOS_TABULATED_COMPACTION,  are written to the 
d3hsp  ﬁle.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
NOUT Output selector for eﬀective plastic strain (s ee table) 
EDROP Post peak dilatancy decay, /u1D441/u1D6FC.st 
RSIZE Unit conversion factor for length (inches/use r-unit).  For 
example, set to 39.37 if user length unit in meters . 
UCF Unit conversion factor for stress (psi/user- unit).  For instance set 
to 145 if |u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst in MPa. 
LCRATE Deﬁne (load) curve number for strain- rate eﬀects; eﬀective strain 
rate on abscissa (negative = tension) and strength enhancement 
on ordinate.  If LCRATE is set to - 1, strain rate eﬀects are 
automatically included , based on equations provided in Wu, 
Crawford, Lan, and Magallanes [2014].  LCRATE = - 1 is 
applicable to models which use time units of second s, for other 
time units, the strain- rate eﬀects should be input by means of a 
curve. 
LOCWID Three times the maximum aggregate diameter ( input in user 
length units). 
NPTS Number of points in |u1D7≠6 versus |u1D7≠2 damage relation; must be 13 
points. 
λ01 1st  value of damage function, (a.k.a., 1 st  value of “modiﬁed” 
eﬀective plastic strain; see references for details ). 
λ02 2nd  value of damage function, 
λ03 3rd  value of damage function, 
λ04 4th  value of damage function, 
λ05 5th  value of damage function, 
λ06 6th  value of damage function, 
λ07 7th  value of damage function,

λ10 10 th  value of damage function, 
λ11 11 th  value of damage function, *.   
 failure surface, depending on whether λ is to the left or right of the ﬁrst peak in the η as 
a function of λ curve.  The “scaled damage measure” ranges from 0 to 1 as the material 
transitions from the yield failure surface to the m aximum failure surface, and thereafter 
ranges from 1 to 2 as the material ranges from the maximum failure surface to the 
residual failure surface.  See the references for d etails. 
Output of Selected Variables: 
The quantity labeled as “plastic strain” by LS-PreP ost is actually the quantity described 
in Table M72-1 , in accordance with the input value of NOUT (see C ard 3 above).
