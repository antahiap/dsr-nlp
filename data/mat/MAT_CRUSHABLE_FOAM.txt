  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
SRCRT Critical stretch ratio for high compression r egime (MODEL = 1).  
A value of 0.1 for SR CRT, for instance, means at 10% residual 
length an elastic stiﬀness is added to avoid excess ive 
compression.  
ESCAL Scale factor for high compression stiﬀness as a multiple of the 
Young’s modulus (MODEL = 1). 
Remarks: 
1.  Volumetric Strain.   The volumetric strain is deﬁned in terms of the r elative 
volume, |u1D449, as: 
|u1D6F∆ = 1 − |u1D449 
The relative volume is deﬁned as the ratio of the c urrent to the initial volume.  
In place of the eﬀective plastic strain in the d3plot  database, the integrated 
volumetric strain (natural logarithm of the relativ e volume) is output. Stressincreasesat

 For lateral straining, individual Poisson’s ratios can be deﬁned for the elastic 
(PR) and the plastic (PRP) regime.  The associated ﬂow potential is given by

with plastic Possion’s ratio /u1D̅08pl  (PRP).  Hardening is deﬁned with yield curve or 
table LCID.  If LCID is a yield curve, it relates u niaxial yield stress as a function 
of equivalent plastic strain.  If LCID refers to a table, then rate dependence is 
taken into account.  The deﬁnition of parameter RFI LTF determines if plastic 
strain rates (RFILT = 0) or ﬁltered total strain ra tes (RFILTF > 0) are used.  In 
the latter case, exponential smoothing is used

Thus, as RFILTF increases, more ﬁltering is done. *
