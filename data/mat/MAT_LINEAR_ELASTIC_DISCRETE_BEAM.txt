This is Material Type 66.  This material model is d eﬁned for simulating the eﬀects of a 
linear elastic beam by using six springs each actin g about one of the six local degrees-of-
freedom.  The two nodes deﬁning a beam may be coinc ident to give a zero length beam 
or oﬀset to give a ﬁnite length beam.  For ﬁnite le ngth discrete beams the absolute value 
of the variable SCOOR in the *SECTION_BEAM input sh ould be set to a value of 2.0, 
which causes the local |u1D4JF-axis to be aligned along the two nodes of the beam , to give 
physically correct behavior.  The distance between the nodes of a beam should not aﬀect 
the behavior of this model.  A triad is used to ori ent the beam for the directional 
springs.  Translational/rotational stiﬀness and vis cous damping eﬀects are considered 
for a local cartesian system; see Remark 1 .  Applications for this element include the 
modeling of joint stiﬀnesses.

Remarks: 
1.  Coordinate System and Orientation.   The formulation of the discrete beam 
(type 6) assumes that the beam is of zero length an d requires no orientation 
node.  A small distance between the nodes joined by  the beam is permitted.  
The local coordinate system which determines (|u1D4JF, |u1D46≠, |u1D461)  is given by the coordi- 
nate ID (see *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ OPTION ) in the cross-sectional input 
(see *SECTION_BEAM), where the global system is the  default.  The local co- *
