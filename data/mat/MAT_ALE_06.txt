  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
3.  If MULO > 0.0, and MUHI > 0.0, then MU LO and MUHI 
are lower and upper viscosity limit values for a po wer-
law-like variable viscosity model. 
4.  If MULO is negative (for example, MULO = - 1), then a 
user-input data load curve (with LCID = 1) deﬁning dy- 
namic viscosity as a function of equivalent strain rate is 
used. 
MUHI Upper dynamic viscosity limit (default = 0.0).  This is deﬁned 
only if RK and RN are deﬁned for the variable visco sity case. 
RK /u1D458, consistency factor (see Remark 6 ) 
RN |u1D4JB, power law index (see Remark 6 ) 
GDOTC |u1D6F∆̇|u1D4J≠Cst, critical shear strain rate (see Remark 6 ) 
TAO0 /u1D̅0F|zeroCst, yield stress (see Remark 6 ) 
Remarks: 
1.  Viscous Stress.   The null material must be used with an equation-o f-state.  
Pressure cutoﬀ is negative in tension.  A (deviator ic) viscous stress of the form 
|u1D7≠∆′|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = 2|u1D7≠7|u1D7≠≠′̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|<racketriµhtCvJ~|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ |<racketleftCvJ1
|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ 
is computed for nonzero |u1D7≠7 where |u1D7≠≠′̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  is the deviatoric strain rate.  |u1D7≠7 is the dy- 
namic viscosity.  For example, in SI unit system, |u1D7≠7 has a unit of [Pa-s]. 
2.  Hourglass Control.   The null material has no shear stiﬀness and hourg lass 
control must be used with care.  In some applicatio ns, the default hourglass 
coeﬃcient might lead to signiﬁcant energy losses.  In general for ﬂuid(s), the 
hourglass coeﬃcient QM should be small (in the rang e of 10 -4 to 10 -6 for the 
standard default IHQ choice). 
3.  Yield Strength.   Null material has no yield strength and behaves i n a ﬂuid-like 
manner. 
4.  Pressure Cut-Off.   The pressure cut-oﬀ, PC, must be deﬁned to allow for a 
material to “numerically” cavitate.  In other words , when a material undergoes 
dilatation above certain magnitude, it should no lo nger be able to resist this *
