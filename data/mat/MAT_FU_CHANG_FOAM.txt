which states that the nonlinear strain rate is the function of stress and a state variable 
which represents the history of loading.  Therefore , the proposed kinetic equation for 
foam materials is:

|u1D437|zeroCst= 0 or /u1D450|zeroCst→∞  then the nonlinear strain rate vanishes.

In the implementation by Fu Chang the model was sim pliﬁed such that the input 
constants |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  and the state variables |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  are scalars. 
Additional Remarks: 
1.  Bulk Viscosity.   The bulk viscosity, which generates a rate depend ent 
pressure, may cause an unexpected volumetric respon se.  Consequently, it is 
optional with this model. 
2.  Constant Velocity Loading.   Dynamic compression tests at the strain rates of 
interest in vehicle crash are usually performed wit h a drop tower.  In this test 
the loading velocity is nearly constant but the tru e strain rate, which depends 
on the instantaneous specimen thickness, is not.  T herefore, the engineering 
strain rate input is optional so that the stress-st rain curves obtained at constant 
velocity loading can be used directly.  See the SFL AG ﬁeld. 
3.  Strain Rates with Multiaxial Loading .  To further improve the response 
under multiaxial loading, the strain rate parameter  can either be based on the 
principal strain rates or the volumetric strain rat e.  See the RFLAG ﬁeld. *.   
 In this case the curve with lowest strain rate valu e (typically zero) in TBID 
must correspond to the unloading path of the materi al as measured in a 
quasistatic test.  The quasistatic loading path the n corresponds to a realis- 
tic (small) value of the strain rate.  At least thr ee curves should be used in 
the table: one for unloading, one for quasistatic, and one or more for dy- 
namic response.  The quasistatic loading and unload ing path (thus the 
ﬁrst two curves of the table) should form a closed loop.  The unloading re- 
sponse is given by a damage formulation for the pri ncipal stresses as fol- 
lows: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst= (1 − |u1D4J1)|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst 
The damage parameter, |u1D4J1, is computed internally in such a way that the 
unloading path under uniaxial tension and compressi on is ﬁtted exactly in 
the simulation.  The unloading response is rate dep endent in this case.  In 
some cases, this rate dependence for loading and  unloading can lead to 
noisy results.  To reduce that noise, it is possibl e to switch to rate inde- 
pendent unloading with RIULD = 1. 
c)  HU > 0 and TBID > 0.   See Figure M83-4 . 
No unloading curve should be provided in the table and the curve with 
the lowest strain rate value in TBID should corresp ond to the loading path 
of the material as measured in a quasistatic test.  At least two curves 
should be used in the table: one for quasistatic an d one or more for dy- 
namic response.  In this case the unloading respons e is given by a damage 
formulation for the principal stresses as follows: Current State
