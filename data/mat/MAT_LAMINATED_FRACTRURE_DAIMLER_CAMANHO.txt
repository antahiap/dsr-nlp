Remarks: 
The failure surface to limit the elastic domain is assembled by four  sub-surfaces, 
representing diﬀerent failure mechanisms.  They are  deﬁned as follows:

Once the stress state reaches the failure criterion , a set of scalar damage variables 
(|u1D4J1|oneCst−, |u1D4J1|oneCst+,  |u1D4J1|twoCst−, |u1D4J1|twoCst+, |u1D4J1|sixCst) is introduced associated with the diﬀerent failur e mechanisms.  
A bi-linear (longitudinal direction) and a linear ( transverse direction) damage evolution 
law is used to deﬁne the development of the damage variables driven by the fracture 
toughness and a characteristic internal element len gth to account for objectivity.  See 
Figure M262-2 . 
To account for the characteristic non-linear in-pla ne shear behavior of laminated ﬁber-
reinforced composites a 1D elasto-plastic formulati on with linear hardening is coupled 
to a linear damage behavior once the maximum allowa ble stress state for shear failure is 
reached.  See Figure M262-3 . 
More detailed information about this material model  can be found in Maimí, Camanho, 
Mayugo and Dávila [2007].  
When failure has occurred in all the composite laye rs (through-thickness integration 
points), the element is deleted.  Elements which sh are nodes with the deleted element Damage evolution:
