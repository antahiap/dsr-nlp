 Remarks: 
The polymer is assumed to have two basic resistance s to deformation: 
1.  An intermolecular barrier to deformation related t o relative movement 
between molecules. 
2.  An evolving anisotropic resistance related to stra ightening of the molecule 
chains. 
 
The model which is implemented and presented in thi s paper is mainly based on the 
framework suggested by Boyce et al.  [2000].  Going  back to the original work by 
Haward and Thackray [1968], they considered the uni axial case only.  The extension to 
a full 3D formulation was proposed by Boyce et al.  [1988].  Moreover, Boyce and co-
workers have during a period of 20 years changed or  further developed the parts of the 
original model.  Haward and Thackray [1968] used an  Eyring model to represent the 
dashpot in Fig. M168-1 , while Boyce et al.  [2000] employed the double-ki nk model of 
Argon [1973] instead.  Part B of the model, describ ing the resistance associated with 
straightening of the molecules, contained originall y a one-dimensional Langevin spring 
[Haward and Thackray, 1968], which was generalized to 3D with the eight-chain model 
by Arruda and Boyce [1993]. 
 
The main structure of the model presented by Boyce et al.  [2000] is kept for this model.

where |u1D6F∆̇|zeroCst|u1D434Cst is a pre-exponential factor, ∆|u1D43A is the energy barrier to ﬂow, |u1D46≠ is the shear 
resistance, /u1D458 is the Boltzmann constant and /u1D̅0: is the absolute temperature.  The shear 
resistance, |u1D46≠, is assumed to depend on the stress triaxiality, |u1D7≠∆∗:

The exact dependence is given by a user-deﬁned load  curve, which is linear between the 
shear resistances in compression and tension.  Thes e resistances are denoted |u1D46≠|u1D4J≠Cst and |u1D46≠|u1D461Cst, 
respectively. 
Part B: Network Resistance: 
The network resistance is assumed to be nonlinear e lastic with deformation gradient 
/u1D405|u1D43JCst=/u1D405|u1D43JCst|u1D441Cst, meaning, any viscoplastic deformation of the netw ork is neglected.  The stress-
