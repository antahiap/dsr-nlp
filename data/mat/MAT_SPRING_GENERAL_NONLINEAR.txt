 *.  *.  option.  Additional unloading 
options have been included.  The two nodes deﬁning the beam may be coincident to 
give a zero length beam or oﬀset to give a ﬁnite le ngth beam.  For ﬁnite length discrete 
beams the absolute value of the variable SCOOR in t he *SECTION_BEAM input should 
be set to a value of 2.0 or 3.0 to give physically correct behavior.   A triad is used to 
orient the beam for the directional springs.
