This is  Material Type 216, a generalization of Material Typ e 1, for which material 
properties change on an element-by-element basis up on crossing a plane in space.  This 
is an isotropic hypoelastic material and is availab le only for shell element types.

characters must be speciﬁed.

X1, Y1, Z1 Coordinates of a point on the phase tran sition plane 
X2, Y2, Z2 Coordinates of a point that deﬁnes the exterior nor mal with the 
ﬁrst point 
THKFAC Scale factor applied to the shell thickness after t he phase 
transformation 
 
Phases: 
The material properties for each element are initia lized using the data for the ﬁrst 
phase.  After the center of the element passes thro ugh the transition plane deﬁned by 
the two points, the material properties are irrever sibly changed to the second phase. 
 
The plane is deﬁned by two points.  The ﬁrst point,  coordinates X1, Y1, and Z1, lies on 
the plane.  The second point, coordinates X2, Y2, a nd Z2, deﬁnes the exterior normal as 
a unit vector in the direction from the ﬁrst point to the second point. 
Remarks: 
This hypoelastic material model may not be stable f or ﬁnite (large) strains.   If large 
strains are expected, a hyperelastic material model , such as *
