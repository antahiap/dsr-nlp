 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
TM Initial  tangent modulus of concrete 
PR Poisson's ratio 
UCS Uniaxial compressive strength 
UTS Uniaxial tensile strength 
FE Depends on value of RATE below. 
RATE.EQ.0: fracture energy (energy per unit area dissipated 
in opening crack) 
RATE.EQ.1,2: crack width at which crack- normal tensile stress 
goes to zero 
ASIZE Aggregate size (radius) 
E Young's modulus of rebar 
YS Yield stress of rebar 
EH Hardening modulus of rebar 
UELONG Ultimate elongation before rebar fails. 
RATE Rate eﬀects: 
EQ.0.0: strain rate eﬀects are included.  WARN ING: energy 
may not be conserved using this option. 
EQ.1.0: strain rate eﬀects are turned oﬀ.  Crack widths are
stored as extra history variables 30, 31, 32. 
EQ.2.0:  like RATE = 1 but includes improved crack algorithm *.

and |u1D43∆ is the bulk unloading modulus computed from 
|u1D43∆ =|u1D438|u1D46≠Cst
3(1 − 2|u1D463)  . 
Here |u1D438|u1D46≠Cst is the input tangent modulus for concrete and |u1D463 is Poisson's ratio.

The Winfrith concrete model can generate an additio nal binary output database 
containing information on crack locations, directio ns, and widths.  In order to generate 
the crack database, the LS-DYNA execution line is m odiﬁed by adding: 
q= crf  
where crf  is the desired name of the crack database, such as  q= d3crack . 
 
LS-PrePost can display the cracks on the deformed m esh plots.  To do so, read the 
d3plot  database into LS-PrePost and then select File  → Open  → Crack  from the top menu 
bar.  Or, open the crack database by adding the fol lowing to the LS-PrePost execution 
line: 
q= crf  
where crf  is the name of the crack database. 
 
By default, all the cracks in visible elements are shown.  You can eliminate narrow 
cracks from the display by setting a minimum crack width for displayed cracks.  Do this 
by choosing Settings  → Post Settings  → Concrete Crack Width .  From the top menu bar of *. _REINF  
 *. _REINF for rebar reinforcement supp lemental to concrete deﬁned 
using Material type 84.  Reinforcement may be deﬁne d in speciﬁc groups of elements, 
but it is usually more convenient to deﬁne a two-di mensional material in a speciﬁed 
layer of a speciﬁed part.  Reinforcement quantity i s deﬁned as the ratio of the cross-
sectional area of steel relative to the cross-secti onal area of concrete in the element (or 
layer).  These cards may follow either one of two f ormats below and may also be 
deﬁned in any order.
