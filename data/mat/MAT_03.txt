the lowest value of the phase transition rate is us ed if the 
phase transition rate falls below the minimum value .  
Likewise, the stress as a fu nction of martensite fraction 
curve for the highest value of phase transition rat e is 
used if the phase transition rate exceeds the maxim um 
value.

Remarks: 
Isotropic hardening for both materials is assumed.  The material to which the glass is 
bonded is assumed to stretch plastically without fa ilure.  A user deﬁned integration rule 
speciﬁes the thickness of the layers making up the glass.  F i deﬁnes whether the 
integration point is glass (0.0) or polymer (1.0).  The material deﬁnition, F i, must be 
given for the same number of integration points (NI PTS) as speciﬁed in the rule.  A 
maximum of 32 layers is allowed. 
If the recommended user deﬁned rule is not deﬁned, the default integration rules are 
used.  The location of the integration points in th e default rules are deﬁned in the *SEC-

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCA Load curve or table ID. Load curve ID deﬁnes the st ress as a 
function of uniaxial strain along the |u1D44∆-axis ﬁber.  Table ID deﬁnes 
for each strain rate a load curve representing stre ss as a function of 
uniaxial strain along the |u1D44∆-axis ﬁber.  The load c urve is available 
for FORM = 4, 14, – 14, and 24 while the table is allowed only for 
FORM = -14. If zero, EA is used.  For FORM = 14, - 14, and 24, this 
curve can be deﬁned in both tension and compression ; see 
Remark 6  below. 
LCB Load curve or table ID. Load curve ID deﬁnes the st ress as a 
function of uniaxial strain along the |u1D44F-axis ﬁber.  Table ID deﬁnes 
for each strain rate a load curve representing stre ss as a function of 
uniaxial strain along the |u1D44F-axis ﬁber.  The load curve is available 
for FORM = 4, 14, - 14, and 24 while the table is allowed only for 
FORM = -14. If zero, EB is used.  For FORM = 14, - 14, and 24, this 
curve can be deﬁned in both tension and compression ; see 
Remark 6  below. 
LCAB Load curve ID for shear stress as a function of she ar strain in the 
|u1D44∆|u1D44F -plane.  If zero, GAB  is used. 
LCUA Unload/reload curve ID for stress as a function of strain along the 
|u1D44∆-axis ﬁber.  If zero, LCA  is used. 
LCUB Unload/reload curve ID for stress as a function of strain along the 
|u1D44F-axis ﬁber.  If zero, LCB  is used. 
LCUAB Unload/reload curve ID for shea r stress as a function of shear 
strain in the |u1D44∆|u1D44F -plane.  If zero, LCAB  is used. 
RL Optional reloading parameter for FORM = 14 and 24.  Values 
between 0.0 (reloading on unloading curve- default) and 1.0 
(reloading on a minimum linear slope between unload i ng curve 
and loading curve) are possible . *. 4  
LS-DYNA R13 2-315 (MAT) The no compression option can allow elements to col lapse to a line which can 
lead to elements becoming tangled.  The elastic lin er option is one way to add 
some stiﬀness in compression to prevent this, see Remark 4 .  Alternatively, 
when using fabric formulations 14, -14, or 24 (see FORM) tangling can be re- 
duced by deﬁning stress/strain curves that include negative strain and stress 
values.  See Remark 6 . 
2.  Porosity.   The parameters FLC and FAC are optional for the W ang-Nefske and 
Hybrid inﬂation models.  It is possible for the air bag to be constructed of mul- 
tiple fabrics having diﬀerent values for porosity a nd permeability.  Typically, 
FLC and FAC must be determined experimentally and t heir variations in time 
or with pressure are optional to allow for maximum ﬂexibility. 
3.  Effects of Airbag-Structure Interaction on Porosity .   To calculate the 
leakage of gas through the fabric it is necessary t o accurately determine the 
leakage area.  The dynamics of the airbag may cause  the leakage area to change 
during the course of the simulation.  In particular , the deformation may change 
the leakage area, but the leakage area may also dec rease when the contact be- 
tween the airbag and the structure blocks the ﬂow.  LS-DYNA can check the 
interaction of the bag with the structure and split  the areas into regions that are 
blocked and unblocked depending on whether the regi ons are in or not in con- 
tact, respectively.  Blockage eﬀects may be control led with the ELA ﬁeld. 
4.  Elastic Liner.   An optional elastic liner can be deﬁned using EL,  PRL and LRA-
TIO.  The liner is an isotropic layer that acts in both tension and compression.  
However, setting, LNRC to 1.0 eliminates compressiv e stress in the liner until 
both principle stresses are tensile.  The compressi ve stress elimination option, 
CSE = 1 , has no inﬂuence on the liner behavior. 
5.  Fiber Axes.   For formulations 0, 1, and 2, (see FORM) the |u1D44∆-axis and |u1D44F-axis 
ﬁber directions are assumed to be orthogonal  and are completely deﬁned by the 
material axes option, AOPT = 0, 2, or 3.  For FORM = 3, 4, 13, or 14, the ﬁber 
directions are not assumed to be orthogonal  and must be speciﬁed using the 
ICOMP = 1 option on *SECTION_SHELL.  Oﬀset angles s hould be input into 
the B1 and B2 ﬁelds used normally for integration p oints 1 and 2.  The |u1D44∆-axis 
and |u1D44F-axis directions will then be oﬀset from the |u1D44∆-axis direction as determined 
by the material axis option, AOPT = 0, 2, or 3. 
When reference geometry is deﬁned, the material axe s are computed using 
coordinates from the reference geometry.  The mater ial axes are determined by 
computing the angle between the element system and the material direction. 
6.  Stress as a function of Strain Curves.   For formulations (see FORM) 4, 14, -
14, and 24, 2 nd  Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress as a function of Green’s str ain curves may 
be deﬁned for |u1D44∆-axis, |u1D44F-axis, and shear stresses for loading and also for unload- 
ing and reloading.  Alternatively, the |u1D44∆-axis and |u1D44F-axis curves can be input us- *. 4

release 6.0.0 of version 971, LS-DYNA changed the w ay that unload/reload 
curves for shear stress-strain relations are interp reted.  Let f be the shear stress 
unload-reload curve LCUAB.  Then, 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst =/u1D450|twoCst|u1D4J3 (/u1D450|oneCst|u1D7≠≠|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst ) 
where the scale factors /u1D450|oneCst and /u1D450|twoCst depend on the fabric form (see FORM) and 
version of LS-DYNA.

When switching fabric forms or versions, the curve scale factors SFA and SFO 
on *DEFINE_CURVE can be used to oﬀset this behavior . 
9.  Per Material Venting Option.   The FVOPT ﬂag allows an airbag fabric venting 
equation to be assigned to a material.  The anticip ated use for this option is to 
allow a vent to be deﬁned using FVOPT = 1 or 2 for one material and fabric 
leakage to be deﬁned for using FVOPT = 3, 4, 5, or 6 for other materials.  In 
order to use FVOPT, a venting option must ﬁrst be d eﬁned for the airbag using 
the OPT parameter on *AIRBAG_WANG_NEFSKE or *AIRBAG _HYBRID.  If 
OPT = 0, then FVOPT is ignored.  If OPT is deﬁned a nd FVOPT is omitted, 
then FVOPT is set equal to OPT. 
10.  TSRFAC Option to Restore Element Strains.   Airbags that use a reference 
geometry will typically have nonzero strains at the  start of the calculation.  To 
prevent such initial strains from prematurely openi ng an airbag, initial strains 
are stored and subtracted from the measured strain throughout the calculation. 
/u1D̅48= |u1D4J3 (/u1D̅:A−/u1D̅:A|iCst|nCst|iCst|tCst|iCst|aCst /l.st) 
• Fabric formulations 2, 3, and 4 (see FORM) subtra ct oﬀ only the initial ten- 
sile strains so these forms are typically used with  CSE = 1 and LNRC = 1. 
• Fabric formulations 12, 13, 14, -14, and 24 subtr act oﬀ the total initial 
strains, so these forms may be used with CSE = 0 or  1 and LNRC = 0 or 1.  
A side eﬀect of this strain modiﬁcation is that air bags may not achieve the 
correct volume when they open.  Therefore, the TSRF AC option is imple- *. 4  
LS-DYNA R13 2-319 (MAT) tions can be used without setting CSE = 1 and LNRC = 1 since compressive 
stress cutoﬀ is not needed to prevent initial airba g movement.  Formulations 2, 
3, and 4 need compressive stress cutoﬀ when used wi th a reference geometry 
or they can generate compressive stress at the star t of a calculation.  Available 
for formulation 12 only, the ISREFG parameter activ ates an option to calculate 
the initial stress by using a reference geometry. 
Material formulation 24 is an enhanced version of f ormulation 14 implement- 
ing a correction for Poisson’s eﬀects when stress a s a function of strain curves 
are input for the |u1D44∆-ﬁber or |u1D44F-ﬁber.  Also, for formulation 24, the outputted 
stress and strain in the elout  or d3plot  database ﬁles is engineering stress and 
strain rather than the 2 nd  Piola Kirchoﬀ and Green’s strain used by formula- 
tions other than 0 and 1. 
12.  Noise Reduction for the Strain Rate Measure.   If tables are used, then the 
strain rate measure is the time derivative of the G reen-Lagrange strain in the 
direction of interest.  To suppress noise, the stra in rate is averaged according to 
the value of DT.  If DT > 0, it is recommended to u se a large enough value to 
suppress the noise, while being small enough to not  lose important infor- 
mation in the signal. 
13.  Hysteresis.   The hysteresis parameter /u1D4:B deﬁnes the fraction of dissipated 
energy during a load cycle in terms of the maximum possible dissipated ener- 
gy.  Referring to the Figure M34-1 , Figure M34-1.  A1 A2

FVOPT = -1 and -2, FLC is active and can be either a scalar or a curve deﬁning 
the porous leakage ﬂow coeﬃcient as a function of t ime.  The FAC coeﬃcient, 
however, is inactive  as the porous leakage velocity is computed using t he for- 
mula speciﬁed in Remark 16  from the coeﬃcient deﬁned in Card 4.  Note that 
for uniform pressure airbags (*AIRBAG_HYBRID_...) both  the FLC and FAC 
coeﬃcients are active. *. 4M

Remarks: 
1.  Material Model.   This material model invokes a special membrane el ement 
formulation regardless of the element choice.  It i s an anisotropic hyperelastic 
model where the 2 nd  Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress  /u1D412 is a function of the Green-
Lagrange strain /u1D404 and possibly its history.  Due to anisotropy, this  strain is 
transformed to obtain the strains in each of the ﬁb er directions, |u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st  and |u1D438/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st , 
together with the shear strain, |u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st . The associated stress components in the 
local system are given as functions of the strain c omponents 
|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st =γ|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st (|u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D438/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st )ϑ
|u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st =γ|u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D438/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st , |u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st )ϑ
|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st =γ|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st )ϑ 
The factor |u1D6F∆ is used for dissipative eﬀects and is described in  more detail in 
Remark 4 .  For TH = 0, |u1D6F∆ = 1 .  The function ϑ represents a strain rate scale fac- 
tor (see Remark 6 ); for FXX = FYY = 0 this factor is 1. While the sh ear relation is 
given directly in the input through the curve SXY, the tabular input of the ﬁber 
stress components PXX and PYY is for the sake of co nvenience.  PXX and PYY 
give the engineering stress as function of engineer ing strain, that is, 
|u1D443/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st = |u1D443/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st (|u1D4J2/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st )
|u1D443/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st = |u1D443/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st ) 
Because of this, the following conversion formulae are used between stresses 
and strains 
|u1D4J2 =/radical.v11 + 2|u1D438 − 1
|u1D446 =|u1D443
1 + |u1D4J2 
which are applied in each of the two ﬁber direction s. 
2.  Compressive Stress Elimination.   Compressive stress elimination is optional 
through the CSE parameter, and when activated the p rincipal components of 
the 2 nd  Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress is restricted to positive va lues.  
3.  Reference Geometry and Smooth Stress Initialization .  If a reference 
geometry is used, then SRFAC is the curve ID for a function |u1D6F+(|u1D461) that should 
increase from zero to unity during a short time spa n.  During this time span, *. 4M

Here |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cst (BULKC) is a physical bulk modulus, /u1D4:D= det(/u1D405) is the jacobian of the 
deformation and /u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst (JACC) is the critical jacobian for when the eﬀect  commenc- 
es. /u1D405 is the deformation gradient.  This contributes to the pressure with a term 
|u1D4JD = |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cstln |parenleftCvJ/u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst
/u1D4:D|parenriµhtCvJ ,  for /u1D4:D≤/u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst 
and thus prevents membrane elements from collapsing  or inverting when sub- 
jected to compressive loads.  The bulk modulus |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cst should be selected with the 
slopes in the stress map tables in mind, presumably  some order of magni- 
tude(s) smaller.   
6.  Strain Rate Scale Factor.   As an option, the local membrane stress can be 
scaled based on the engineering strain rates via th e function /u1D̅1̅=/u1D̅1̅(|u1D4J2̇,/u1D412). We set 
|u1D4J2̇= max |parenleftCvJ/u1D̅16̇
‖/u1D405/u1D412‖, 0|parenriµhtCvJ 
to be the equivalent engineering strain rate in the  direction of loading and de- 
ﬁne 
/u1D̅1̅(|u1D4J2̇,/u1D4̅A) =|u1D439/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st (|u1D4J2̇)||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st | + |u1D439/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D4J2̇)||u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st | + 2||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st |
||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st | + ||u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st | + 2||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st |, 
meaning that the strain rate scale factor defaults to the user input data FXX and 
FYY for uniaxial loading in the two material direct ions, respectively.  Note that 
we only consider strain rate scaling in loading and  not in unloading, and fur- 
thermore that the strain rates used in evaluating t he curves are pre-ﬁltered 
using the time window DT to avoid excessive numeric al noise.  It is, therefore, 
recommended to set DT to a time corresponding to at  least hundred time steps 
or so. *. 6

LS-DYNA R13 2-347 (MAT) rolling direction, VLCID curve should give the rela tive volume change as function of 
strain for uniaxial tension in the rolling directio n and load curve given by −E should 
give the Young’s modulus as function of strain for uniaxial tension in the rolling 
direction.  Optionally, the curve can be substitute d for a table deﬁning hardening as 
function of plastic strain rate (HR = 3), temperatu re (HR = 8), or pre-strain (HR = 10).  
 
Exceptions from the rule above are curves deﬁned as  functions of plastic strain in the 
45 ° and 90 ° directions, i.e.,  |u1D4431 and |u1D4432 for HR = 7 and negative R45  or R 90 , see Fleischer 
et.al.  [2007].  The hardening curves are here deﬁn ed as measured stress as function of 
measured plastic strain for uniaxial tension in the  direction of interest, i.e., as 
determined from experimental testing using a standa rd procedure.  The optional biaxial 
and shear hardening curves require some further ela boration, as we assume that a 
biaxial or shear test reveals that the true stress tensor in the material system expressed 
as 
 
/u1D̅48= |parenleftCv4|u1D7≠∆ 0
0±|u1D7≠∆|parenriµhtCv4 , |u1D7≠∆ ≥ 0, 
is a function of the (plastic) strain tensor

0±|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|parenriµhtCvJ , |u1D7≠≠|oneCst≥ 0, |u1D7≠≠|twoCst≥ 0, 
The input hardening curves are |u1D7≠∆ as function of |u1D7≠≠|oneCst+|u1D7≠≠|twoCst. The ± sign above distinguishes 
between the biaxial ( +) and the shear ( −) cases.  Moreover, the curves deﬁning the |u1D44J-
values are as function of the measured plastic stra in for uniaxial tension in the direction 
of interest.  These curves are transformed internal ly to be used with the eﬀective stress 
and strain properties in the actual model.  The eﬀe ctive plastic strain does not coincide 
with the plastic strain components in other directi ons than the rolling direction and may 
be somewhat confusing to the user.  Therefore the v on Mises work equivalent plastic 
strain is output as history variable #2 if HR = 7 o r if any of the R-values is deﬁned as 
function of the plastic strain. 
 
The |u1D44J-values in curves are deﬁned as the ratio of instan taneous width change to 
instantaneous thickness change.  That is, assume th at the width /u1D44A and thickness |u1D447 are 
measured as function of strain.  Then the correspon ding |u1D44J-values is given by: 
|u1D44J =|u1D4J1 /u1D44A 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ //u1D44A
|u1D4J1|u1D447 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ /|u1D447 
The anisotropic yield criterion Φ for plane stress is deﬁned as: 
Φ= |u1D44∆||u1D43∆|oneCst+ |u1D43∆|twoCst||u1D4JACst+ |u1D44∆||u1D43∆|oneCst− |u1D43∆|twoCst||u1D4JACst+/u1D450|2|u1D43∆|twoCst||u1D4JACst= 2|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st|u1D4JACst 
where |u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st is the yield stress and |u1D43∆|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst/co⋯⋯a.st|twoCst are given by: 
|u1D43∆|oneCst=|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst+ℎ|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst

LS-DYNA R13 2-349 (MAT) where |u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst  is the elastic strain to yield and  |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCstis the eﬀective plastic strain (logarithmic).  If 
SIGY is set to zero, the strain to yield if found b y solving for the intersection of the 
linearly elastic loading equation with the strain h ardening equation: 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D438|u1D7≠≠ 
|u1D7≠∆ =/u1D458|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JBCst 
which gives the elastic strain at yield as: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst = |parenleftCvJ|u1D438
/u1D458|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst 
If SIGY yield is nonzero and greater than 0.02 then : 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst = |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst

|u1D4JBCst
 
The other available hardening models include the Vo ce equation given by: 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst |u1D4JDCsts, 
the Gosh equation given by: 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst) =/u1D458(|u1D7≠≠|zeroCst+ |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst)|u1D4JBCst− |u1D4JD, 
and ﬁnally the Hocket-Sherby equation given by: 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst |u1D4JDCsts/u1D45B.sts
. 
For the Gosh hardening law, the interpretation of t he variable SPI is the same, i.e., if set 
to zero the strain at yield is determined implicitl y from the intersection of the strain 
hardening equation with the linear elastic equation . 
 
To include strain rate eﬀects in the model we multi ply the yield stress by a factor 
depending on the eﬀective plastic strain rate.  We use the Cowper-Symonds’ model; 
hence the yield stress can be written as: 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D7≠∆/Y.st|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst)

|u1D436|parenriµhtCv6|oneCst/|u1D4JDCst
⎭|<raceriµhtCex⎬|<raceriµhtCex⎫
 
where |u1D7≠∆/Y.st|u1D46≠Cst denotes the static yield stress, |u1D436 and |u1D4JD are material parameters, and |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst is the 
eﬀective plastic strain rate.  With HR.EQ.3 strain rate eﬀects can be deﬁned using a 
table, in which each load curve in the table deﬁnes  the yield stress as function of plastic 
strain for a given strain rate.  In contrast to mat erial 24, when the strain rate is larger 
than that of any curve in the table, the table is e xtrapolated in the strain rate direction to 
ﬁnd the appropriate yield stress.  
 
A kinematic hardening model is implemented followin g the works of Chaboche and 
Roussilier.  A back stress /u1D̅:6 is introduced such that the eﬀective stress is com puted as: 
|u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st= |u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst − 2|u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst , |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst − 2|u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst , |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|twoCst ) *. 6  
LS-DYNA R13 2-351 (MAT) To enable the output of these history variables to the d3plot  ﬁles, NEIPS on the *DATA-
BASE_EXTENT_BINARY card must be set to at least 3.  The history variables can also 
be plotted on the formed sheet blank as a color con tour map, accessible from 
Post/FriComp/Misc  menu.  The index value starts from 0.0, with the o nset of necking 
failure when it reaches 1.0.  The F.I. is calculate d based on critical eﬀect strain method, 
as explained in manual pages in *.  7. 
 
When d3plot  ﬁles are used to plot the history variable #1 (the  F.I.) in color contour, the 
value in the Max  pull-down menu in Post/FriComp  needs to be set to Min , meaning that 
the necking failure occurs only when all integratio n points through the thickness have 
reached the critical value of 1.0 (refer to Tharrett and Stoughton’s paper in 2003 SAE 2003-
01-1157 ).  It is also suggested to set the variable “MAXIN T” in *DATA-
BASE_EXTENT_BINARY to the same value as the variabl e “NIP” in *SEC-
TION_SHELL.  In addition, the value in the Avg  pull-down menu in Post/FriRang  needs 
to be set to None .  The strain path history (major vs.  minor strain ) of each element can 
be plotted with the radial dial button Strain Path  in Post/FLD . 
 
An example of a partial input for the material is p rovided below, where the FLD for the 
linear strain path is deﬁned by the variable NLP wi th load curve ID 211, where 
abscissas represent minor strains and ordinates rep resent major strains.

Smoothing of the strain ratio /u1D̅:̅: 
*CONTROL_FORMING_STRAIN_RATIO_SMOOTH applies a smoo thing algorithm to 
reduce output noise level of the strain ratio |u1D6FD (in-plane minor strain increment/major 
strain increment) which is used to calculate the Fo rmability Index.

Starting in Dev139482, non-integer value of the exp onent |u1D4JA is supported for the option

Heat treatment with variable HTFLAG: 
Heat treatment for increasing the formability of pr estrained aluminum sheets can be 
simulated through the use of HTFLAG, where the inte ntion is to run a forming 
simulation in steps involving preforming, springbac k, heat treatment and postforming.  
In each step the history is transferred to the next  via the use of dynain (see *INTER-
FACE_SPRINGBACK).  The ﬁrst two steps are performed  with HTFLAG = 0 according 
to standard procedures, resulting in a plastic stra in ﬁeld |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCstcorresponding to the 
prestrain.  The heat treatment step is performed us ing HTFLAG = 1 in a coupled *. 6  
LS-DYNA R13 2-353 (MAT) thermomechanical simulation, where the blank is hea ted.  The coupling between 
thermal and mechanical is only that the maximum tem perature |u1D447|zeroCst is stored as a history 
variable in the material model, this corresponding to the heat treatment temperature.  
Here it is important to export all history variable s to the dynein ﬁle for the postforming 
step.  In the ﬁnal postforming step, HTFLAG = 2, th e yield stress is then augmented by 
the Hocket-Sherby like term: 
∆|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D44F − (|u1D44F − |u1D44∆)exp |<racketleftCv4− /u1D450|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst− |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv2/u1D451.st|<racketriµhtCv4 
where |u1D44∆, |u1D44F,/u1D450 |u1D44∆|u1D4JB|u1D4J1 |u1D4J1  are given as tables as functions of the heat treatm ent temperature |u1D447|zeroCst 
and prestrain |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst. That is, in the table deﬁnitions each load curve c orresponds to a given 
prestrain and the load curve value is with respect to the heat treatment temperature, 
|u1D44∆ = |u1D44∆(|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst)    |u1D44F = |u1D44F(|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst)    /u1D450=/u1D450(|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst)    |u1D4J1 = |u1D4J1(|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst)     
The eﬀect of heat treatment is that the material st rength decreases but hardening 
increases, thus typically: 
|u1D44∆ ≤ 0    |u1D44F ≥ |u1D44∆    /u1D450> 0    |u1D4J1 > 0

LS-DYNA R13 2-361 (MAT) Formulation: 
The standard 3-parameter Barlat model incorporates plastic anisotropy in a fairly 
moderate sense, allowing for the speciﬁcation of R- values in three diﬀerent directions, 
together with a stress level in the reference direc tion (termed rolling  or 0 degree  
direction), but not more than that.  To allow for a  more accurate representation of a 
more severe anisotropic material, like in rolled al uminium sheet components, one could 
migrate to the Barlat YLD2000 model (material 133 i n LS-DYNA) which also allows for 
specifying stress levels in the two remaining direc tions as well as stress and strain data 
at an arbitrary point on the yield surface.  The pr operties of extruded aluminium 
however, are such that neither of these two materia l models are suﬃcient to describe its 
extreme anisotropy.  One particular observation fro m experiments is that anisotropy 
evolves with deformation, a feature that is not cap tured in any of the material models 
discussed so far.  The present extended version of material 36 was therefore developed 
in an attempt to ﬁll this void in the LS-DYNA mater ial library.  In short, this material 
allows for R-values and stress levels in the three directions, together with similar data in 
biaxial and shear directions. And , these properties are functions of the eﬀective pl astic 
strain so as to allow for deformation induced aniso tropy.  The following is an 
explanation of its parameters. 
 
The hardening curves or tables LCH00, LCH45 and LCH 90 are here deﬁned as 
measured stress as function of measured plastic str ain (and potentially rate) for uniaxial 
tension in the direction of interest, i.e., as dete rmined from experimental testing using a 
standard procedure.  The optional biaxial and shear  hardening curves LCHBI and 
LCHSH require some further elaboration, as we assum e that a biaxial or shear test 
reveals that the true stress tensor in the material  system expressed as 
/u1D̅48= |parenleftCv4|u1D7≠∆ 0
0±|u1D7≠∆|parenriµhtCv4 , |u1D7≠∆ ≥ 0, 
is a function of the (plastic) strain tensor 
/u1D̅:A= |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠|oneCst 0
0±|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|parenriµhtCvJ , |u1D7≠≠|oneCst≥ 0, |u1D7≠≠|twoCst≥ 0, 
The input hardening curves are |u1D7≠∆ as function of |u1D7≠≠|oneCst+|u1D7≠≠|twoCst. The ± sign above distinguishes 
between the biaxial ( +) and the shear ( −) cases. 
 
Moreover, the curves LCR00, LCR45 and LCR90 deﬁning  the R values are as function of 
the measured plastic strain for uniaxial tension in  the direction of interest.  The R-values 
in themselves are deﬁned as the ratio of instantane ous width change to instantaneous 
thickness change.  That is, assume that the width W  and thickness T are measured as 
function of strain.  Then the corresponding R-value  is given by:

|u1D439(|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst )|twoCst+ |u1D43A(|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst − |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst )|twoCst+/u1D4:B(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst )|twoCst+ 2/u1D4:F|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|threeCst |twoCst+ 2|u1D44≠|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|oneCst |twoCst+ 2/u1D441|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst |twoCst− 1
= 0 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst, and |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst are the tensile yield stresses and |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|oneCst|twoCst , |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst|threeCst , and |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst|oneCst  are 
the shear yield stresses.  The constants |u1D439, |u1D43A, /u1D4:B, /u1D4:F, |u1D44≠, and /u1D441 are related to the 
yield stress by: 
2|u1D439 =1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst|twoCst+1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst |twoCst−1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|oneCst |twoCst
2|u1D43A =1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst |twoCst+1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|oneCst |twoCst−1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst |twoCst
2/u1D4:B=1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|oneCst |twoCst+1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst |twoCst−1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst |twoCst *. 7  
LS-DYNA R13 2-367 (MAT) |u1D44J =|u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst|twoCst |u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4JDCst  . 
It then follows that 
|u1D44J =2
|u1D43∆|twoCst− 1  . 
Using the plane stress assumption and the deﬁnition  of |u1D44J, the yield function 
may now be written as: 
|u1D439(|u1D7≠∆) = |<racketleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst |twoCst+ |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst |twoCst−2|u1D44J
|u1D44J + 1|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst + 22|u1D44J + 1
|u1D44J + 1|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst |twoCst|<racketriµhtCvJ|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2
. 
2.  Anisotropic Parameter R.   When the |u1D44J value is set to a negative value, it 
stabilizes the sheet thickness or thinning in sheet metal forming for some high 
strength types of steel or in cases where the simul ation time is long.  In Figure 
M37-1 , a comparison of thinning contours is shown on a U -channel forming 
(one-half model) using negative and positive |u1D44J values.  Maximum thinning on 
the draw wall is slight higher in the negative |u1D44J case than that in the positive |u1D44J 
case. 
3.  Comparison to other Material Models.  There are several diﬀerences 
between this model and other plasticity models for shell elements such as the 
model, . 7  *. 7  
LS-DYNA R13 2-369 (MAT) Formability index (F.I) is calculated, as illustrat ed in Figure M37-2 , for every 
element in the sheet blank throughout the simulatio n duration.  The value of 
F.I. is 0.0 for virgin material and reaches maximum  of 1.0 when the material 
fails.  The theoretical background can be found in two papers: 1) T.B. Stough- 
ton, X. Zhu, “Review of Theoretical Models of the S train-Based FLD and their Rele- 
vance to the Stress-Based FLD, International Journa l of Plasticity”, V. 20, Issues 8-9, 
P. 1463-1486, 2003; and 2) Danielle Zeng, Xinhai Zh u, Laurent B. Chappuis, Z. 
Cedric Xia,  “A Path Independent Forming Limited Cr iterion for Sheet Metal Forming 
Simulations”, 2008 SAE Proceedings, Detroit MI, Apr il, 2008 .  
6.  ICFLD.   The load curve input for ICFLD follows keyword fo rmat in *DEFINE_-
CURVE, with abscissas as minor strains and ordinate s as major strains. 
ICFLD can also be speciﬁed using the *DEFINE_CURVE_ FLC keyword where 
the sheet metal thickness and strain hardening valu e are used.  Detailed usage 
information can be found in the manual entry for *D EFINE_CURVE_FLC. 
7.  Formability Index Output.   The formability index is output as a history 
variable #1 in d 3plot  ﬁles.  In addition to the F.I. values, starting in  Revision 
95599, the strain ratio |u1D6FD and eﬀective plastic strain |u1D7≠≠̅ are written to the d 3plot  
database as history variables #2 and #3, respective ly provided NEIPS on the 
second ﬁeld of the ﬁrst card of *DATABASE_EXTENT_BI NARY is set to at 
least 3.  The contour map of history variables can be plotted in LS-PrePost, 
accessible in Post /FriComp , under Misc , and by Element , under Post/History .  It 
is suggested that variable MAXINT in *DATABASE_EXTE NT_BINARY be set 
to the same value of as the NIP ﬁeld for the *SECTI ON_SHELL keyword. 
8.  STRAINLT.   By setting the STRAINLT ﬁeld strains (and strain ratios) can be 
averaged to reduce noise, which, in turn, aﬀect the  calculation of the formabil- 
ity index.  The strain STRAINLT causes the formabil ity index calculation to use 
only time averaged strains.  Reasonable STRAINLT va lues range from 5 × 10 −|threeCst 
to 10 −|twoCst.*. 8
