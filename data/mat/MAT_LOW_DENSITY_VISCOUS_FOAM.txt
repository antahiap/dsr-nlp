  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
EQ.0.0: tensile stress remains at cut-oﬀ value. 
EQ.1.0: tensile stress is reset to zero. 
BVFLAG Bulk viscosity activation ﬂag (see remarks b elow): 
EQ.0.0: no bulk viscosity (recommended) 
EQ.1.0: bulk viscosity active 
KCON Stiﬀness coeﬃcient for contact interface stiﬀness.  If undeﬁned, 
the maximum slope in the stress as a function of st rain curve is 
used.  When the maximum slope is taken for the cont act, the time 
step size for this material is re duced for stability.  In some cases, 
∆|u1D461 may be signiﬁcantly smaller, so deﬁning a reasonabl e stiﬀness 
is recommended. 
LCID2 Load curve ID of relaxation curve.  If LCID2 > 0, constants |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst and 
|u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst are determined using a least squares ﬁt.  An examp le is shown 
in Figure M76-1 .  This model ignores the constant stress. 
BSTART Fit parameter.  In the ﬁt, |u1D6FD|oneCst is set to zero, |u1D6FD|twoCst  is set to BSTART, |u1D6FD|threeCst
is 10 times |u1D6FD|twoCst, |u1D6FD|fourCst is 10 times greater than |u1D6FD|threeCst , and so on.  If zero, 
BSTART = .01. 
TRAMP Optional ramp time for loading 
NV Number of terms in ﬁt.  Currently, the maximum numb er is 6.  
Since each term used adds signiﬁcantly to the cost,  2 or 3 terms is 
recommended.  Ca ution should be exercised when taking the 
results from the ﬁt.  Preferably, all generated coe ﬃcients should 
be positive because negative values may lead to uns table results.  
Once a satisfactory ﬁt has been achieved, we recomm end using 
the output coeﬃcients in future runs. 
 
Relaxation Constant Cards.  If LCID2 = 0, then include this card.  Up to 6 cards may 
be input.  The next keyword (“*”) card terminates t his input.

 Remarks: 
1.  Material Formulation.   This viscoelastic foam material formulation model s 
highly compressible viscous foams.  The hyperelasti c formulation of this model 
follows that of Material 57.  
2.  Rate Effects.   Rate eﬀects are accounted for through linear visc oelasticity by a 
convolution integral of the form 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JFCst=/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst 
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst  , 
where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) is the relaxation function.  The stress tensor, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JFCst, augments the 
stresses determined from the foam, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D45:.st; consequently, the ﬁnal stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , is 
taken as the summation of the two contributions: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D45:.st+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JFCst  . 
Since we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, t he relaxation function is 
represented by up to six terms of the Prony series:  
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst  . 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a dampers and 
springs in series.  The formulation is performed in  the local system of principal 
stretches where only the principal values of stress  are computed and triaxial 
coupling is avoided.  Consequently, the one-dimensi onal nature of this foam 
material is unaﬀected by this addition of rate eﬀec ts.  The addition of rate 
eﬀects necessitates 42 additional history variables  per integration point.  The 
cost and memory overhead of this model comes primar ily from the need to 
“remember” the local system of principal stretches and the evaluation of the 
viscous stress components. 
Frequency data can be ﬁt to the Prony series.  Usin g Fourier transforms the 
relationship between the relaxation function and th e frequency dependent data 
is
