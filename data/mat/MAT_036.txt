LS-DYNA R13 2-347 (MAT) rolling direction, VLCID curve should give the rela tive volume change as function of 
strain for uniaxial tension in the rolling directio n and load curve given by −E should 
give the Young’s modulus as function of strain for uniaxial tension in the rolling 
direction.  Optionally, the curve can be substitute d for a table deﬁning hardening as 
function of plastic strain rate (HR = 3), temperatu re (HR = 8), or pre-strain (HR = 10).  
 
Exceptions from the rule above are curves deﬁned as  functions of plastic strain in the 
45 ° and 90 ° directions, i.e.,  |u1D4431 and |u1D4432 for HR = 7 and negative R45  or R 90 , see Fleischer 
et.al.  [2007].  The hardening curves are here deﬁn ed as measured stress as function of 
measured plastic strain for uniaxial tension in the  direction of interest, i.e., as 
determined from experimental testing using a standa rd procedure.  The optional biaxial 
and shear hardening curves require some further ela boration, as we assume that a 
biaxial or shear test reveals that the true stress tensor in the material system expressed 
as 
 
/u1D̅48= |parenleftCv4|u1D7≠∆ 0
0±|u1D7≠∆|parenriµhtCv4 , |u1D7≠∆ ≥ 0, 
is a function of the (plastic) strain tensor 
/u1D̅:A= |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠|oneCst 0
0±|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|parenriµhtCvJ , |u1D7≠≠|oneCst≥ 0, |u1D7≠≠|twoCst≥ 0, 
The input hardening curves are |u1D7≠∆ as function of |u1D7≠≠|oneCst+|u1D7≠≠|twoCst. The ± sign above distinguishes 
between the biaxial ( +) and the shear ( −) cases.  Moreover, the curves deﬁning the |u1D44J-
values are as function of the measured plastic stra in for uniaxial tension in the direction 
of interest.  These curves are transformed internal ly to be used with the eﬀective stress 
and strain properties in the actual model.  The eﬀe ctive plastic strain does not coincide 
with the plastic strain components in other directi ons than the rolling direction and may 
be somewhat confusing to the user.  Therefore the v on Mises work equivalent plastic 
strain is output as history variable #2 if HR = 7 o r if any of the R-values is deﬁned as 
function of the plastic strain. 
 
The |u1D44J-values in curves are deﬁned as the ratio of instan taneous width change to 
instantaneous thickness change.  That is, assume th at the width /u1D44A and thickness |u1D447 are 
measured as function of strain.  Then the correspon ding |u1D44J-values is given by: 
|u1D44J =|u1D4J1 /u1D44A 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ //u1D44A
|u1D4J1|u1D447 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ /|u1D447 
The anisotropic yield criterion Φ for plane stress is deﬁned as: 
Φ= |u1D44∆||u1D43∆|oneCst+ |u1D43∆|twoCst||u1D4JACst+ |u1D44∆||u1D43∆|oneCst− |u1D43∆|twoCst||u1D4JACst+/u1D450|2|u1D43∆|twoCst||u1D4JACst= 2|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st|u1D4JACst 
where |u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st is the yield stress and |u1D43∆|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst/co⋯⋯a.st|twoCst are given by: 
|u1D43∆|oneCst=|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst+ℎ|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst
2 *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-349 (MAT) where |u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst  is the elastic strain to yield and  |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCstis the eﬀective plastic strain (logarithmic).  If 
SIGY is set to zero, the strain to yield if found b y solving for the intersection of the 
linearly elastic loading equation with the strain h ardening equation: 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D438|u1D7≠≠ 
|u1D7≠∆ =/u1D458|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JBCst 
which gives the elastic strain at yield as: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst = |parenleftCvJ|u1D438
/u1D458|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst 
If SIGY yield is nonzero and greater than 0.02 then : 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst = |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst
/u1D458|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D4JBCst
 
The other available hardening models include the Vo ce equation given by: 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst |u1D4JDCsts, 
the Gosh equation given by: 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst) =/u1D458(|u1D7≠≠|zeroCst+ |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst)|u1D4JBCst− |u1D4JD, 
and ﬁnally the Hocket-Sherby equation given by: 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst |u1D4JDCsts/u1D45B.sts
. 
For the Gosh hardening law, the interpretation of t he variable SPI is the same, i.e., if set 
to zero the strain at yield is determined implicitl y from the intersection of the strain 
hardening equation with the linear elastic equation . 
 
To include strain rate eﬀects in the model we multi ply the yield stress by a factor 
depending on the eﬀective plastic strain rate.  We use the Cowper-Symonds’ model; 
hence the yield stress can be written as: 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D7≠∆/Y.st|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst)
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧

|u1D436|parenriµhtCv6|oneCst/|u1D4JDCst
⎭|<raceriµhtCex⎬|<raceriµhtCex⎫
 
where |u1D7≠∆/Y.st|u1D46≠Cst denotes the static yield stress, |u1D436 and |u1D4JD are material parameters, and |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst is the 
eﬀective plastic strain rate.  With HR.EQ.3 strain rate eﬀects can be deﬁned using a 
table, in which each load curve in the table deﬁnes  the yield stress as function of plastic 
strain for a given strain rate.  In contrast to mat erial 24, when the strain rate is larger 
than that of any curve in the table, the table is e xtrapolated in the strain rate direction to 
ﬁnd the appropriate yield stress.  
 
A kinematic hardening model is implemented followin g the works of Chaboche and 
Roussilier.  A back stress /u1D̅:6 is introduced such that the eﬀective stress is com puted as: 
|u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st= |u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst − 2|u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst , |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst − 2|u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst , |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|twoCst ) *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-351 (MAT) To enable the output of these history variables to the d3plot  ﬁles, NEIPS on the *DATA-
BASE_EXTENT_BINARY card must be set to at least 3.  The history variables can also 
be plotted on the formed sheet blank as a color con tour map, accessible from 
Post/FriComp/Misc  menu.  The index value starts from 0.0, with the o nset of necking 
failure when it reaches 1.0.  The F.I. is calculate d based on critical eﬀect strain method, 
as explained in manual pages in *.   *.   
LS-DYNA R13 2-353 (MAT) thermomechanical simulation, where the blank is hea ted.  The coupling between 
thermal and mechanical is only that the maximum tem perature |u1D447|zeroCst is stored as a history 
variable in the material model, this corresponding to the heat treatment temperature.  
Here it is important to export all history variable s to the dynein ﬁle for the postforming 
step.  In the ﬁnal postforming step, HTFLAG = 2, th e yield stress is then augmented by 
the Hocket-Sherby like term: 
∆|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D44F − (|u1D44F − |u1D44∆)exp |<racketleftCv4− /u1D450|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst− |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv2/u1D451.st|<racketriµhtCv4 
where |u1D44∆, |u1D44F,/u1D450 |u1D44∆|u1D4JB|u1D4J1 |u1D4J1  are given as tables as functions of the heat treatm ent temperature |u1D447|zeroCst 
and prestrain |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst. That is, in the table deﬁnitions each load curve c orresponds to a given 
prestrain and the load curve value is with respect to the heat treatment temperature, 
|u1D44∆ = |u1D44∆(|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst)    |u1D44F = |u1D44F(|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst)    /u1D450=/u1D450(|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst)    |u1D4J1 = |u1D4J1(|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst)     
The eﬀect of heat treatment is that the material st rength decreases but hardening 
increases, thus typically: 
|u1D44∆ ≤ 0    |u1D44F ≥ |u1D44∆    /u1D450> 0    |u1D4J1 > 0

LS-DYNA R13 2-361 (MAT) Formulation: 
The standard 3-parameter Barlat model incorporates plastic anisotropy in a fairly 
moderate sense, allowing for the speciﬁcation of R- values in three diﬀerent directions, 
together with a stress level in the reference direc tion (termed rolling  or 0 degree  
direction), but not more than that.  To allow for a  more accurate representation of a 
more severe anisotropic material, like in rolled al uminium sheet components, one could 
migrate to the Barlat YLD2000 model (material 133 i n LS-DYNA) which also allows for 
specifying stress levels in the two remaining direc tions as well as stress and strain data 
at an arbitrary point on the yield surface.  The pr operties of extruded aluminium 
however, are such that neither of these two materia l models are suﬃcient to describe its 
extreme anisotropy.  One particular observation fro m experiments is that anisotropy 
evolves with deformation, a feature that is not cap tured in any of the material models 
discussed so far.  The present extended version of material 36 was therefore developed 
in an attempt to ﬁll this void in the LS-DYNA mater ial library.  In short, this material 
allows for R-values and stress levels in the three directions, together with similar data in 
biaxial and shear directions. And , these properties are functions of the eﬀective pl astic 
strain so as to allow for deformation induced aniso tropy.  The following is an 
explanation of its parameters. 
 
The hardening curves or tables LCH00, LCH45 and LCH 90 are here deﬁned as 
measured stress as function of measured plastic str ain (and potentially rate) for uniaxial 
tension in the direction of interest, i.e., as dete rmined from experimental testing using a 
standard procedure.  The optional biaxial and shear  hardening curves LCHBI and 
LCHSH require some further elaboration, as we assum e that a biaxial or shear test 
reveals that the true stress tensor in the material  system expressed as 
/u1D̅48= |parenleftCv4|u1D7≠∆ 0
0±|u1D7≠∆|parenriµhtCv4 , |u1D7≠∆ ≥ 0, 
is a function of the (plastic) strain tensor 
/u1D̅:A= |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠|oneCst 0
0±|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|parenriµhtCvJ , |u1D7≠≠|oneCst≥ 0, |u1D7≠≠|twoCst≥ 0, 
The input hardening curves are |u1D7≠∆ as function of |u1D7≠≠|oneCst+|u1D7≠≠|twoCst. The ± sign above distinguishes 
between the biaxial ( +) and the shear ( −) cases. 
 
Moreover, the curves LCR00, LCR45 and LCR90 deﬁning  the R values are as function of 
the measured plastic strain for uniaxial tension in  the direction of interest.  The R-values 
in themselves are deﬁned as the ratio of instantane ous width change to instantaneous 
thickness change.  That is, assume that the width W  and thickness T are measured as 
function of strain.  Then the corresponding R-value  is given by:
