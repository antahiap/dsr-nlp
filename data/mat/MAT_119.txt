 Remarks: 
1.  Failure Criterion.   When the catastrophic failure criterion is satisﬁ ed, the 
discrete element is deleted.  Failure for this mate rial depends directly on the 
displacement resultants.  The failure criterion dep ends on the value of FCRIT.  
If FCRIT = 0.0, failure occurs if either of the fol lowing inequalities are satisﬁed: 
|u1D434|u1D461Cst− 1 ≥ 0
|u1D434|u1D4J≠Cst− 1 ≥ 0 
where

/u1D̅0:|u1D461Cstcfail |<racketriµhtCv6|twoCst 
Positive (tension) values of displacement and rotat ion are considered in the 
ﬁrst criterion and negative (compression) values in  the second.  Either the ten- 
sion failure or the compression failure or both may  be used.  If any of the input 
failure displacements and rotations (UTFAILR etc) a re left as zero, the corre- 
sponding terms will be omitted from the equations f or A t and A c above.   
If FCRIT = 1.0, then a single criterion is used: 
|u1D434|u1D461Cst+ |u1D434|u1D4J≠Cst− 1 ≥ 0 
Thus, the combined eﬀect of all the displacements a nd rotations is considered, 
be they positive or negative. 
2.  Force.   There are two formulations for calculating the fo rce.  The ﬁrst is the 
standard displacement formulation, where, for examp le, the force in a linear 
spring is 
|u1D439 = −|u1D43∆∆ ℓ 
for a change in length of the beam of ∆ ℓ. The second formulation is based on 
the linear strain, giving a force of 
|u1D439 = −|u1D43∆∆ ℓ
ℓ|zeroCst 
for a beam with an initial length of ℓ|zeroCst. This option is useful when there are 
springs of diﬀerent lengths but otherwise similar c onstruction since it automat- *
