 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Belt material number.  A unique number or label mus t be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
MPUL Mass per unit length 
LLCID Curve or table ID for loading.  LL CID can be either a single curve 
(force as a function of engineering strain) or a ta ble deﬁning a set 
of strain-rate dependent load curves. 
ULCID Load curve identiﬁcation for unloading (force as a function of 
engineering strain) 
LMIN Minimum length (for elements connected to slip ring s and 
retractors); see Remark 4 . 
CSE Compressive stress elimination option which applies  to shell 
elements only, available since r137465/dev for non- zero FORM.  
The old recommended option of CSE = 2, available since R8, still 
works if and only if FORM = 0.  For non-zero FORM: 
EQ.0.0: don’t eliminate compressive stresses in shell fabri c. 
EQ.1.0: eliminate compressive stresses in shell fabric.   
DAMP Optional Rayleigh damping coeﬃcient, which applies to shell 
elements only.  A coeﬃcient value of 0.10 is the de fault 
corresponding to 10% of critical damping.  Sometime s smaller or 
larger values work better. 
E Young’s modulus for bending/compression s tiﬀness, when 
positive, the optional card is invoked.  See Remark 5 . 
A Cross sectional area for bending/compression stiﬀne ss; see 
remarks. *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
10% of the Young’s determined by LS-DY NA based on 
the loading curve, LLCID. 
LT.0.0: |EB| is the ratio of Young’s modulus along the 
transverse direction to the Young’s modulus deter- 
mined by LS-DYNA based on the loading curve, LL-
CID. 
GT.0.0: EB is the Young’s modulus along the transverse 
direction. 
PRBA 
(PRAB) Minor (Major) Poisson’s ratio |u1D44F|u1D44∆ (|u1D44∆|u1D44F ) direction 
GAB Shear modulus in the |u1D44∆|u1D44F  direction.  Set to a very small value for an 
isotropic elastic material; see *.   *.   
 R × (MASS/2) × I/A , where MASS indicates the total translational mass  of the 
belt element and R is a scaling factor input by the  user.  The translational mass 
is not modiﬁed.  The bending and compression proper ties do not aﬀect the 
stable time step.  If the belts are used without  sliprings, then incorporating this 
feature is virtually equivalent to adding Belytschk o-Schwer beams on top of 
conventional belt elements as part of the modelling  strategy.  If sliprings are  
used, this feature is necessary to properly support  the ﬂow of material through 
the sliprings and swapping of belt elements across sliprings.  Retractors cannot 
be used with this feature.  *
