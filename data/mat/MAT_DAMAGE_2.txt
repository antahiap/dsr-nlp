This is  Material Type 105.  This is an elastic viscoplastic  material model combined with 
continuum damage mechanics (CDM).  This material mo del applies to shell, thick shell, 
and brick elements.  The elastoplastic behavior is described in the description of 
material model 24. A more detailed description of t he CDM model is given in the 
description of material model 104 above.

LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID.  Load curve ID deﬁning e ﬀective 
stress as a function of eﬀective plastic strain.  I f deﬁned EPS1 - EP-
S8 and ES1 - ES8 are ignored.  The table ID deﬁnes for each stra in 
rate value a load curve ID giving the stress as a f unc tion of 
eﬀective plastic strain for that rate, See Figure M24-1 .  The stress 
as a function of eﬀective plastic strain curve for the lowest value 
of strain rate is used if the strain rate falls b elow the minimum *.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
ES1 - ES8 Corresponding yield stress values to EPS1  - EPS8. 
Remarks: 
By deﬁning the tangent modulus (ETAN), the stress-s train behavior becomes a bilinear 
curve.  Alternately, a curve similar to that shown in Figure M10-1  is expected to be 
deﬁned by (EPS1, ES1)  - (EPS 8, ES 8); however, an eﬀective stress as a function of 
eﬀective plastic strain curve ID (LCSS) may be inpu t instead if eight points are 
insuﬃcient.  The cost is roughly the same for eithe r approach.  The most general 
approach is to use the table deﬁnition with table I D, LCSS, discussed below. 
Three options to account for strain rate eﬀects are  possible. 
1.  Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  , 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate, |u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
2.  For complete generality a load curve (LCSR) to sca le the yield stress may be 
input instead.  In this curve the scale factor as a  function of strain rate is de- 
ﬁned. 
3.  If diﬀerent stress as a function of strain curves can be provided for various 
strain rates, the option using the reference to a t able (LCSS) can be used.  Then 
the table input in *DEFINE_TABLE must be used; see Figure M24-1  
A fully viscoplastic formulation is used in this mo del. *
