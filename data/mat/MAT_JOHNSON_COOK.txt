This is  Material Type 15.  The Johnson/Cook strain and temp erature sensitive plasticity 
is sometimes used for problems where the strain rat es vary over a large range and 
adiabatic temperature increases due to plastic heat ing cause material softening.  When 
used with solid elements, this model requires an eq uation-of-state.  If thermal eﬀects 
and damage are unimportant, we recommend the much l ess expensive *.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
G Shear modulus.  G and an equation-of- state are required for 
element types that use a 3D stress update, such as solids, 2D shell 
forms 13- 15, and tshell forms 3, 5, and 7.   For other eleme nt 
types, G is ignored, and E and PR must be provided.  
E Young’s Modulus (see note above pertaining to G) 
PR Poisson’s ratio (see note above pertaining to G)  
DTF Minimum time step size for automatic element deleti on (shell 
elements).  The element will be deleted when the so lution time 
step size drops below DTF × TSSFAC  where TSS FAC is the time 
step scale factor deﬁned by *CONTROL_ TIMESTEP.  See 
Remark 4 . 
VP Formulation for rate eﬀects: 
EQ.0.0: Scale yield stress (default) 
EQ.1.0: Viscoplastic formulation 
RATEOP Form of strain rate term.  RATEOP is ignored  if VP = 0. See

PC Tensile failure stress or tensile pressure cutoﬀ  (PC   <  0.0) 
SPALL Spall type (see Remark 3 ): 
EQ.0.0: Set to “2.0” (default). 
EQ.1.0: Tensile pressure is limited by PC, that is, |u1D4JD is always ≥
PC. 
Shell Element  Speciﬁc Behavior: 
EQ.2.0: Shell elements are deleted when |u1D7≠∆max ≥ −PC . 
EQ.3.0: Shell elements are deleted when  |u1D4JD < PC . 
Solid Element  Speciﬁc Behavior 
EQ.2.0:  For solid elements |u1D7≠∆max ≥ −PC  resets tensile stresses to 
zero.  Compressive stress are still allowed. 
EQ.3.0:  For solid elements |u1D4JD < PC  resets the pressure to zero 
thereby disallowing tensile pressure. 
IT Plastic strain iteration option.  This input applie s to solid 
elements only since it is always necessary to itera te for the shell 
element plane stress condition. 
EQ.0.0: No iterations (default) 
EQ.1.0: Accurate iterative solution for p lastic strain.  Much 
more expensive than default.

EROD Erosion ﬂag: 
EQ.0.0: Element erosion allowed (default). 
NE.0.0: Element does not erode; deviatoric stresses set to zero 
when element fails. 
EFMIN Lower bound for calculated strain at fracture  (see Remark 2 ) 
NUMINT Number of through thickness integration points whic h must fail 
before the shell element is deleted.  If zero, all integ ration points 
must fail (the default).  Since nodal ﬁber rotation s limit strains at 
active integration points, we do not recommend the default 
because elements undergoing large strain are often not deleted 
using this criterion.  Better results may be obtain ed when NU-
MINT is set to 1 or a number less than one half of the number of 
through thickness points.  For example, if four thr ough thickness 
points are used, NU MINT should not exceed 2, even for fully 
integrated shells which have 16 integration points.

|u1D447melt − |u1D447room  
The quantity |u1D447 − |u1D447room  is stored as extra history variable 5.  In the cas e of a 
mechanical-only analysis, this is the adiabatic tem perature increase calculated 
as  
|u1D447 − |u1D447room =internal energy 
|parenleftCv2|u1D436|u1D4JDCst× |u1D7≠+ × |u1D449 /u1D45C|parenriµhtCv2  , 
where 
|u1D436|u1D4JDCst and |u1D7≠+ =  input constants 
|u1D449 /u1D45C=  initial v olume 
In a coupled thermal/mechanical analysis, |u1D447 − |u1D447room  includes heat- 
ing/cooling from all sources, not just adiabatic he ating from the internal ener- 
gy. 
Constants for a variety of materials are provided i n Johnson and Cook [1983].  
A fully viscoplastic formulation is optional (VP) w hich incorporates the rate 
equations within the yield surface.  An additional cost is incurred, but the im- 
provement in the results can be dramatic. 
Due to nonlinearity in the dependence of ﬂow stress  on plastic strain, an accu- 
rate value of the ﬂow stress requires iteration for  the increment in plastic 
strain.  However, by using a Taylor series expansio n with linearization about 
the current time, we can solve for |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst with suﬃcient accuracy to avoid iteration. 
2.  Strain at Fracture.  The strain at fracture is given by 
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st= max|parenleftCv1|<racketleftCv1|u1D437|oneCst+ |u1D437|twoCstexp|u1D437|threeCst|u1D7≠∆∗|<racketriµhtCv1[1 + |u1D437|fourCstln|u1D7≠≠̇∗][1 + |u1D437|fiveCst|u1D447∗], EFMIN|parenriµhtCv1  , 
where |u1D7≠∆∗ is the ratio of pressure divided by eﬀective stres s 
|u1D7≠∆∗=|u1D4JD
|u1D7≠∆eff    . 
Fracture occurs when the damage parameter, 
|u1D437 =∑∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st  , 
reaches the value of 1.  |u1D437 is stored as extra history variable 4 in shell ele ments 
and extra history variable 6 in solid elements. 
3.  Spall Models.   A choice of three spall models is oﬀered to repre sent material 
splitting, cracking, and failure under tensile load s:  
a)  Pressure Limit Model.   The pressure limit model limits the minimum hy- 
drostatic pressure to the speciﬁed value, |u1D4JD ≥ |u1D4JDmin .  If the calculated pres- 
sure is more tensile than this limit, the pressure is reset to |u1D4JDmin .  This *.
