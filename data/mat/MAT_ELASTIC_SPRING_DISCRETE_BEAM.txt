Generally, these referenced parts are used only for  the deﬁnition of this material model 
and are not referenced by any elements.  The two no des deﬁning a beam may be 
coincident to give a zero length beam or oﬀset to g ive a ﬁnite length beam.  For ﬁnite 
length discrete beams the absolute value of the var iable SCOOR in the *SECTION_-
BEAM input should be set to a value of 2.0, which c auses the local |u1D4JF-axis to be aligned 
along the two nodes of the beam to give physically correct behavior.  The distance 
between the nodes of a beam should not aﬀect the be havior of this material model.  A 
triad is used to orient the beam for the directiona l springs.

TPIDR Translational motion in the local |u1D4JF-direction is governed by part 
ID TPIDR .  If zero, no force is computed in this direction. 
TPIDS Translational motion in the local |u1D46≠-direction is governed by part 
ID TPIDS .  If zero, no force is computed in this direction. 
TPIDT Translational motion in the local |u1D461-direction is governed by part 
ID TPIDT .  If zero, no force is computed in this direction. 
RPIDR Rotational motion about the local |u1D4JF-axis is governed by part ID 
RPIDR .  If zero, no moment is computed about this axis. 
RPIDS Rotational motion about the local |u1D46≠-axis is governed by part ID 
RPIDS .  If zero, no moment is computed about this axis. *
