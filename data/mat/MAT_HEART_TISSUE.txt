  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
AOPT Material axes option (see MAT _OPTION  TROPIC_ELASTIC for a 
more complete description): 
EQ.0.0: locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes 1, 2, and 4, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_NODES. 
EQ.1.0: locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y a 
point in space and the global location of the eleme nt 
center; this is the |u1D44∆-direction. 
EQ.2.0: globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR. 
EQ.3.0: locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector, /u1D42F, with the 
element normal. 
EQ.4.0: locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector, /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D4JD, which deﬁne the centerline ax- 
is. 
LT.0.0: the absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VEC TOR).  Available in R3 version of 971 
and later. 
MACF Material axes change ﬂag for brick elements: 
EQ.1: No change, default, 
EQ.2: switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F, 
EQ.3: switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450, 
EQ.4: switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450.

D1, D2, D3 Components of vector /u1D41D for AOPT = 2 
V1, V2, V3 Components of vector /u1D42F for AOPT = 3 and 4 *.   
 A cross-ﬁber, in-plane stress equivalent to 40% of that along the myocardial 
ﬁber direction is added.

energy functional in terms of the Green strain comp onents, |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst ,

The Green components are modiﬁed to eliminate any e ﬀects of volumetric 
work following the procedures of Ogden.  See the pa per by Guccione et al  
[1991] for more detail. *
