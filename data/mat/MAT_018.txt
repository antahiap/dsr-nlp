LS-DYNA R13 2-209 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
SIGY Optional input parameter for deﬁning the initi al yield stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst.  
Generally, this parameter is not necessary and the strain to yield 
is calculated as described below. 
LT.0.02: |u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst = SIG Y  
GT.0.02: see remarks below. 
EPSF Plastic failure strain for element deletion 
VP Formulation for rate eﬀects: 
EQ.0.0: scale yield stress (default) 
EQ.1.0: viscoplastic formulation 
Remarks: 
Elastoplastic behavior with isotropic hardening is provided by this model.  The yield 
stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst, is a function of plastic strain and obeys the equ ation: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst=/u1D458|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JBCst=/u1D458|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst + |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2|u1D4JBCst  , 
where |u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst  is the elastic strain to yield and  |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCstis the eﬀective plastic strain (logarithmic).  If 
SIGY is set to zero, the strain to yield is found b y solving for the intersection of the 
linearly elastic loading equation with the strain h ardening equation: 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D438|u1D7≠≠ 
|u1D7≠∆ =/u1D458|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JBCst 
which gives the elastic strain at yield as: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst = |parenleftCvJ|u1D438
/u1D458|parenriµhtCvJ|<racketleftCv4|oneCst
|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst|<racketriµhtCv4
  . 
If SIGY is nonzero and greater than 0.02 then: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst = |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst
/u1D458|parenriµhtCvJ|<racketleftCv4|oneCst
|u1D4JBCst|<racketriµhtCv4
  . 
Strain rate is accounted for using the Cowper and S ymonds model which scales the 
yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  . 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate.  A fully viscoplastic formulat ion is optional which 
incorporates the Cowper and Symonds formulation wit hin the yield surface.  An 
additional cost is incurred but the improvement is results can be dramatic. *
