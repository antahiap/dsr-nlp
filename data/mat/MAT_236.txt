Additional constitutive model requirements include a simple (meaning non-damage 
model based) option that can model the tension crac k requirement: a “stress-cutoﬀ” in 
tension.  This option satisﬁes the tension crack re quirements by limiting the stress in 
tension but not compression and having the tensile “yielding” (that is, the stress-cutoﬀ) 
be fully recoverable – not plasticity or damage bas ed. 
 
The tension stress-cutoﬀ separately resets the stre ss to a limit value when it is exceeded 
in each of the two principal directions.  There is also a strain-based memory criterion 
that ensures unloading follows the same path as loa ding: the “memory criterion” is the 
tension stress assuming that no stress cutoﬀs were in eﬀect.  In this way, when the 
memory criterion exceeds the user-speciﬁed cutoﬀ st ress, the actual stress will be set to 
that value.  When the element unloads and the memor y criterion falls back below the 
stress cutoﬀ, normal behavior resumes.  Using this criterion is a simple way to ensure 
that unloading does not result in any hysteresis.  The cutoﬀ criterion cannot be based on 
an eﬀective stress value because eﬀective stress do es not discriminate between tension 
and compression while also including shear.  This m eans that the in plane, 1- and 2- 
directions must be modeled as independent to use th e stress cutoﬀ.  Because the 
Poisson’s ratio is not zero, this assumption is not  true for cracks that may arbitrarily lie 
along any direction.  However, careful examination of damaged RCC shows that the 
surface cracks do, generally, tend to lie in the fa bric directions, meaning that cracks tend 
to open in the 1- or the 2- direction independently .  So the assumption of directional 
independence for tension cracks may be appropriate for the coating because of this 
observed orthotropy.

 to be the tangent of the polynomial curve.  As a re sult, the stress/strain response has a 
continuous derivative, which aids in avoiding numer ical instabilities.  The test data 
does not clearly deﬁne the failure strain of the co ating, but in the impact test it appears 
that the coating has a higher compressive failure s train in bending than the laminate 
failure strain. 
 
The two dominant modes of loading which cause coati ng loss on the impact side of the 
RCC (the front-side) are in-plane compression and t ransverse shear.  The in-plane 
compression is measured by the peak out of plane te nsile strain,  |u1D7≠≠|threeCst.  As there is no 
direct loading of a shell element in this direction , |u1D7≠≠|threeCst is computed through Poisson’s 
relation:  
|u1D7≠≠|threeCst=−|u1D463
1 − |u1D463(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst+ |u1D7≠≠|twoCst)  . 
When |u1D7≠≠|threeCst is tensile, it implies that the average of |u1D7≠≠|oneCst and |u1D7≠≠|twoCst is compressive.  This failure 
mode will likely dominate when the RCC undergoes la rge bending, putting the front-
side coating in high compressive strains.  A transv erse shear failure mode is expected to 
dominate when the debris source is very hard or ver y fast.  By deﬁnition, the shell 
element cannot give a precise account of the transv erse shear throughout the RCC’s 
thickness.  However, the Belytschko-Tsay shell elem ent formulation in LS-DYNA has a 
ﬁrst-order approximation of transverse shear that i s based on the out-of-plane nodal 
displacements and rotations that should suﬃce to gi ve a qualitative evaluation of the 
transverse shear.  By this formulation, the transve rse shear is constant through the 
entire shell thickness and thus violates surface-tr action conditions.  The constitutive 
model implementation records the peak value of the tensile out-of-plane strain ( |u1D7≠≠|threeCst) and 
peak root-mean-sum transverse-shear: /radical.v2|u1D7≠≠|oneCst|threeCst |twoCst+ |u1D7≠≠|twoCst|threeCst |twoCst.*
