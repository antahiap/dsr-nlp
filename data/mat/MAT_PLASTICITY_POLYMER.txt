This is Material Type 89.  An elasto-plastic materi al with an arbitrary stress as a 
function of strain curve and arbitrary strain rate dependency can be deﬁned.  It is 
intended for applications where the elastic and pla stic sections of the response are not 
as clearly distinguishable as they are for metals.  Rate dependency of failure strain is 
included.  Many polymers show a more brittle respon se at high rates of strain.

LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID 
Load Curve.   When LC SS is a load curve ID, it is taken as 
deﬁning eﬀective stress as a function of total eﬀec tive strain.  
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the stress as a function eﬀect ive strain for 
that rate.   
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   If the ﬁrst  value in the table is 
negative, LS-DYNA assumes that all the table val ues represent 
the natural logarithm of a strain rate.  Since the tables are 
internally discretized to equally space the table v alues, it makes 
good sense from an accuracy standpoint that the tab le values 
represent the natural log of strain rate when the l o west strain rate 
and highest strain rate diﬀer by several orders of magnitude. 
LCSR Load curve ID deﬁning strain rate scaling eﬀect on yield stress.  If 
LC SR is negative, the load curve is evaluated using a  binary 
search for the correct interval for t he strain rate.  The binary 
search is slower than the default incremental searc h, but in cases 
where large changes in the strain rate may occur ov er a single 
time step, it is more robust. 
EFTX Failure ﬂag: 
EQ.0.0: Failure determined by maximum tensile strain 
(default). 
EQ.1.0: Failure determined only by tensile strain in local |u1D46J
direction. 
EQ.2.0: Failure determined only by tensile strain in local |u1D466
direction. 
DAMP Stiﬀness-proportional damping ratio.  Typical value s are 10 −|threeCst or 
10 −|fourCst.  If set too high, instabilities can result. 
RFAC Filtering factor for strain rate eﬀects.  Must be b etween 0 (no 
ﬁltering) and 1 (inﬁnite ﬁltering).  The ﬁlter is a  simple low pass *.   
 /u1D6C6|minuteCst= de v iatoric strain tensor, where each |u1D7≠≠|u1D46JCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst, and |u1D7≠≠|u1D467Cst is cumulati v e 
3.  Yield Stress Load Curves.   When looking up yield stress from the load curve 
LCSS, the |u1D46J-axis value is |u1D7≠≠v m . 
4.  Failure Strain Load Curves.  
|u1D7≠≠sr =d|u1D7≠≠pm 
d|u1D461= strain rate for failure and damage calculation 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D439Cst= LCFAIL(|u1D7≠≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D4JFCst ) 
= Instantanous true strain to failure from loo k -up on the cur v e LCFAIL 
5.  Damage.   A damage approach is used to avoid sudden shocks when the 
failure strain is reached.  Damage begins when the "strain ratio," |u1D44J, reaches 1.0, 
where 
|u1D44J =/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠pm 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D439Cst. 
Damage is complete, and the element fails and is de leted, when |u1D44J = 1.1 .  The 
damage, 
|u1D437 =
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧1.0  |u1D44J < 1.0
10(1.1 − |u1D44J) 1.0 < |u1D44J < 1.1  , 
is a reduction factor applied to all stresses.  For  example, when |u1D44J = 1.05 , then 
|u1D437 = 0.5 . 
6.  Strain Deﬁnitions.   Unlike other LS-DYNA material models, both the in put 
stress-strain curve and the strain to failure are d eﬁned as total true strain, not 
plastic strain.  The input can be deﬁned from uniax ial tensile tests; nominal 
stress and nominal strain from the tests must be co nverted to true stress and 
true strain.  The elastic component of strain must not be subtracted out. 
7.  Elastic Stiffness Scaling.   The stress-strain curve is permitted to have sect ions 
steeper (i.e. stiﬀer) than the elastic modulus.  Wh en these are encountered the 
elastic modulus is increased to prevent spurious en ergy generation.  The elastic 
stiﬀness is scaled by a factor |u1D4J3e, which is calculated as follows: 
|u1D4J3|u1D4J2Cst= max |parenleftCv41.0,|u1D46≠max 
3|u1D43A|parenriµhtCv4 
where 
|u1D43A = initial shear modulus 
|u1D446max = maximum slope of stress-strain cur v e encountered during the analysis 
8.  Precision.   Double precision is recommended when using this m aterial model, 
especially if the strains become high. *
