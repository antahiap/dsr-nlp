 Remarks: 
1.  Deviatoric Viscous Stress.   The null material must be used with an equation 
of-state.  Pressure cutoﬀ is negative in tension.  A (deviatoric) viscous stress of 
the form 
|u1D7≠∆′|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠7|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst
|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|<racketriµhtCvJ≈|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ |<racketleftCvJ1
|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ 
is computed for nonzero |u1D7≠7 where |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst is the deviatoric strain rate.  |u1D7≠7 is the dy- 
namic viscosity with unit of [Pa × s] . 
2.  Hourglass Control Issues.   The null material has no shear stiﬀness and 
hourglass control must be used with care.  In some applications, the default 
hourglass coeﬃcient might lead to signiﬁcant energy  losses.  In general for 
ﬂuid(s), the hourglass coeﬃcient QM should be small  (in the range 10 -4 to 10 -6 
for the standard default IHQ choice). 
3.  Null Material Properties.   The null material has no yield strength and behav es 
in a ﬂuid-like manner. 
4.  Numerical Cavitation.   The pressure cut-oﬀ, PC, must be deﬁned to allow for 
a material to “numerically” cavitate.  In other wor ds, when a material under- 
goes dilatation above certain magnitude, it should no longer be able to resist 
this dilatation.  Since dilatation stress or pressu re is negative, setting PC limit 
to a very small negative number would allow for the  material to cavitate once 
the pressure in the material goes below this negati ve value. 
5.  Issues with Small Value of Viscosity Exponent.   If the viscosity exponent is 
less than 1.0 ( RN < 1.0 ) then RN − 1.0 < 0.0 .  In this case, at very low equiva- 
lent strain rate, the viscosity can be artiﬁcially very high.  MULO is then used 
as the viscosity value. 
6.  Turbulent Viscosity.   Turbulence is treated simply by considering its e ﬀects on 
viscosity.  Total eﬀective viscosity is the sum of the laminar and turbulent vis- 
cosities, |u1D7≠7eff = |u1D7≠7|u1D4J9Cst+ |u1D7≠7|u1D461Cst where |u1D7≠7eff  is the eﬀective viscosity, and |u1D7≠7|u1D461Cst is the turbu- 
lent viscosity.  The turbulent viscosity is compute d based on the Prandtl’s 
Mixing Length Model, 
|u1D7≠7|u1D461Cst=ρ/u1D45∫|u1D4JACst|twoCst|∇/u1D42F|  .*
