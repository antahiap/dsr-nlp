MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART).

GAMMA1 Numerical surface tension coeﬃcient.  For water, a coeﬃcient of 
|u1D6F∆|oneCst=1000  m/s|twoCst is recommended.  
GAMMA2 Numerical surface tension coeﬃcient.  For water, a coeﬃcient of 
|u1D6F∆|twoCst=1 m/s|twoCst is recommended.  
Remarks: 
The surface tension coeﬃcients are purely numerical  and are based on a normalized 
version of the algorithm presented in [ 1].
