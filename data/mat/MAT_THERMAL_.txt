Remarks: 
Curves and tables are sometimes needed for deﬁning material properties.  An example 
would be a curve of eﬀective stress as a function o f eﬀective plastic strain deﬁned using 
the command *DEFINE_CURVE.  In general, the followi ng can be said about curves 
and tables that are referenced by material models:   
1.  Curves are internally rediscretized using equal in crements along the |u1D46J-axis.   
2.  Curve data is interpolated between rediscretized d ata points within the 
deﬁned range of the curve and extrapolated as neede d beyond the deﬁned 
range of the curve. 
3.  Extrapolation is not employed for table value.  Se e the manual entries for the 
*DEFINE_TABLE_… keywords.  
4.  See Remarks under *DEFINE_CURVE and *DEFINE_TABLE.*MAT  MATERIAL MODEL REFERENCE TABLES

speciﬁed chemical reactions.  A maximum of 8 specie s and 8 chemical reactions can be 
deﬁned.  The thermal material properties of a ﬁnite  element undergoing chemical 
reactions are calculated based on a mixture law con sisting of those chemical species 
currently present in the element.  The dependence o f the chemical reaction rate on 
temperature is described by the Arrhenius equation.   Time step splitting is used to 
couple the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations  describing the chemical reaction 
kinetics to the system of partial diﬀerential equat ions describing the diﬀusion of heat.
