  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
AOPT Material axes option (see MAT _{ OPTION }TROPIC_ELASTIC for 
a more complete description): 
EQ.0.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes 1, 2, and 4, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_NODES, and then rotated about the shell ele- 
ment normal by an angle BETA 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BETA, fr om a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector /u1D42F with the 
element normal 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR).   
A1, A2, A3 Components of vector /u1D41A for AOPT = 2 
D1, D2, D3 Components of vector /u1D41D for AOPT = 2 
V1 ,V2, V3 Components of vector /u1D42F for AOPT = 3 
BETA Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 0 and 3. It may be 
overridden on the element card; see *ELEMENT_SHELL_ BETA. 
Remarks: 
The in-plane elastic matrix for in-plane, plane str ess behavior is given by:
