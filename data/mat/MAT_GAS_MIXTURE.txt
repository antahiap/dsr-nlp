This is Material Type 148.  This model is for the s imulation of thermally equilibrated 
ideal gas mixtures.  This model only works with the  multi-material ALE formulation 
(ELFORM = 11 in *SECTION_SOLID).  This keyword must  be used together with *INI-
TIAL_GAS_MIXTURE for the initialization of gas dens ities and temperatures.  When 
applied in the context of ALE airbag modeling, the injection of inﬂator gas is done with 
a *SECTION_POINT_SOURCE_MIXTURE command which contr ols the injection 
process.  *.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MOLWT1 -
MOLWT8 Molecular weight of each ideal gas in the mixture ( mass-
unit/mole).  See Remark 2 . 
CPmole1 - 
CPmole8 Heat capacity at constant pressure for up to eight diﬀerent gases 
in per-mole unit.  These ar e nominal heat capacity values 
typically at STP.  These are denoted by the variabl e |u1D434 in the 
equation in Remark 2 .

at co nstant pressure for up to eight diﬀerent gases.  Th ese are 
denoted by the variable |u1D43J in the equation in Remark 2 . 
C1 - C8 Second order coeﬃcient for a temperature dependent heat 
capacity at constant pressure for up to eight diﬀer ent gases.  
These are denoted by the variable |u1D436 in the equation in Remark 2 . 
Remarks: 
1.  Methods for Deﬁning Gas Properties.   There are 2 methods of deﬁning the 
gas properties for the mixture.  If RUNIV is BLANK or ZERO, Method (A) is 
used to deﬁne constant heat capacities where per-ma ss unit values of |u1D436|u1D463Cst and 
|u1D436|u1D4JDCst are input.  Only Cards 2a.1 and 2a.2 are required for this method.  Method 
(B) is used to deﬁne constant or temperature depend ent heat capacities where 
per-mole unit values of |u1D436|u1D4JDCst are input.  Cards 2b.1 through 2b.4 are required f or 
this method. 
2.  Temperature Dependent Heat Capacity.   The per-mass-unit, temperature-
dependent, constant-pressure heat capacity is 
|u1D436|u1D4JDCst(|u1D447) =[CPmole + |u1D43J × |u1D447 + |u1D436 × |u1D447|twoCst]
MOLWT  
See Table M148-1 . 
3.  Initial Temperature and Density.   The initial temperature and the density of 
the gas species present in a mesh or part at time z ero is speciﬁed by the key-

 Table M148-1.   Standard SI units *.  the dissipated kine tic energy is automat- 
ically converted into heat (internal energy).  Thus , in eﬀect the total energy is 
conserved instead of conserving just the internal e nergy.  This numerical 
scheme has been shown to improve accuracy in some c ases.  However, the user 
should always be vigilant and check the physics of the problem closely. 
5.  IADIAB.   As an example, consider an airbag surrounded by a mbient air.  As 
the inﬂator gas ﬂows into the bag, the ALE elements  cut by the airbag fabric 
shell elements will contain some inﬂator gas inside  and some ambient air out- 
side.  The multi-material element treatment is not perfect.  Consequently the 
temperature of the outside air may be made artiﬁcia lly high after the multi-
material element treatment.  To prevent the outside  ambient air from getting 
artiﬁcially high |u1D447, set IADIAB = 1 for the ambient air outside.  A si mple adia- 
batic compression equation is then assumed for the outside air.  The use of this 
ﬂag may be needed, but only when that air is modele d by the *.   
  
The *INITIAL_GAS_MIXTURE keyword input is also show n below.  It basically 
speciﬁes that “AMMGID 2 may be present in part or m esh H4 at |u1D461 = 0 , and the initial 
density of this gas is deﬁned in the rho1 position which corresponds to the 1 st  material 
in the mixture (or H5, the resident gas).”
