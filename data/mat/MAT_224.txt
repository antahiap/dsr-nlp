 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
E Young’s modulus: 
GT.0.0: Constant value is used.

table ID for strain rate and temperature dependence , a 
3-dimensional table ID for temperature (TABLE_ 3D), 
strain rate (TABLE) and plastic strain (CURVE) de- 
pendence, or a 4- dimensional table ID for triaxiality 
(TABLE_4D), temperature (TABLE_ 3D), strain rate 
(TABLE) and plastic strain (CURVE) dependence. 
NUMINT GT.0.0:  Number of integration points wh ich must fail before 
the element is deleted.  Available for shells and s ol- *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
of element size.  The table ID deﬁnes for each tria xiality a load 
curve ID giving the plastic failure strain versus e lement size for 
that triaxiality.  If referring to a three- dimensional table ID, plastic 
failure strain can be a function of Lode parameter (TABLE_ 3D), 
triaxiality (TABLE), and element size (CURVE).  See  Remark 2  for 
a description of the combination of LCF, LCG, LCH, and LCI. 
FAILOPT Flag for additional failure criterion |u1D439|twoCst (see Remark 3 ). 
EQ.0: Oﬀ (default) 
EQ.1: On 
NUMAVG Number of time steps for running average of plastic  failure strain 
in the additional failure criterion.  Default is 1 (no averaging).  See 
Remark 3 . 
NCYFAIL Number of time steps that the additional fa ilure crit erion must be 
met before element deletion.  Default is 1. See Remark 3 . 
ERODE Erosion ﬂag (only for solid elements):  
EQ.0: Default, element erosion is allowed. 
EQ.1: Element does not erode; deviatoric stresse s set to zero 
when element fails. 
LCPS Table ID with ﬁrst principal stress limit as a func tion of plastic 
strain (curves) and plastic strain rate (table).  T his option is for 
post- processing purposes only and gives an indication of  areas in 
the structure where failure is likely to occur.  Hi st ory variable #17 
shows a value of 1.0 for integration points that ex ceeded the limit, 
else a value of 0.0. 
Remarks: 
1.  Flow Stress. The ﬂow stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst is expressed as a function of plastic strain |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, 
plastic strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst and temperature |u1D447 through the following formula (using 
load curves/tables LCK1 and LCKT): 
|u1D46≠|u1D466Cst=/u1D458|oneCst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst)/u1D458|u1D461Cst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D447)
/u1D458|u1D461Cst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D447|u1D44JCst) 
Note that |u1D447|u1D44JCst is a material parameter and should correspond to t he temperature 
used when performing the room temperature tensile t ests.  If simulations are to 
be performed with an initial temperature TI deviating from |u1D447|u1D44JCst, then this tem- *.   
 3.  Failure Criterion. The default failure criterion of this material mode l depends 
on plastic strain evolution |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst and on plastic failure strain |u1D7≠≠pf  and is obtained by 
accumulation over time: 
|u1D439 =/integral.v:|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst /u1D45:.st|u1D4J1|u1D461 
where element erosion takes place when |u1D439 ≥ 1.  This accumulation provides 
load-path dependent treatment of failure.  The valu e of |u1D439 is stored as history 
variable #8 for shells and #12 for solids.   
An additional, load-path independent, failure crite rion can be invoked by set- 
ting FAILOPT = 1, where the current state of plasti c strain is used: 
|u1D439|twoCst=|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst /u1D45:.st 
Two additional parameters can be used as countermea sures against stress os- 
cillations for this failure criterion.  With NUMAVG  active, plastic failure strain 
is averaged over NUMAVG time steps for the |u1D439|twoCst criterion.  The value of |u1D439|twoCst, 
taking into account any averaging per NUMAVG, is st ored as history variable 
#14 for shells and #16 for solids.  NUMAVG cannot e xceed 30. NCYFAIL de- 
ﬁnes the number of time steps that |u1D439|twoCst≥ 1 must be met before element deletion 
takes place.  The number of time steps that |u1D439|twoCst≥ 1 is stored as history variable 
#15 for shells and #19 for solids. 
4.  Change in Temperature.  Temperature increase is caused by plastic work 
|u1D447 = |u1D447|u1D44JCst+|u1D6FD
|u1D436|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠+/integral.v:|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst|u1D4J1|u1D461 
with room temperature |u1D447|u1D44JCst, dissipation factor |u1D6FD, speciﬁc heat |u1D436|u1D4JDCst, and density |u1D7≠+. 
If a coupled thermal/structural analysis is perform ed, temperatures from the 
thermal solver are used.  In that case, the plastic  work that is to be converted to 
hear is transferred to the thermal solver as additi onal volumetric heat source.  
If no dissipation factor is deﬁned, the value of FW ORK in *CONTROL_THER-
MAL_SOLVER is used. 
5.  Failure when used with *CONSTRAINED_TIED_NODES_WITH _FAILURE.  
For *CONSTRAINED_TIED_NODES_WITH_FAILURE, the failu re is based on 
the damage instead to the plastic strain. 
6.  History Variables.  History variables may be post-processed through 
additional variables.  The number of additional var iables for shells/solids writ- 
ten to the d3plot  and d3thdt  databases is input by the optional *DATABASE_-
EXTENT_BINARY card as variable NEIPS/NEIPH. Speciﬁc ally, when used 
with shell element type 14 or 15, history variable output will be as a solid ele- *. _GYS
