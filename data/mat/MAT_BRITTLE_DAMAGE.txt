This is  Material Type 96.  It is an anisotropic brittle dam age model designed primarily 
for concrete though it can be applied to a wide var iety of brittle materials.

Remarks: 
A full description of the tensile and shear damage parts of this material model is given 
in Govindjee, Kay and Simo [1994,1995].  This model  admits progressive degradation of 
tensile and shear strengths across smeared cracks t hat are initiated under tensile 
loadings.  Compressive failure is governed by a sim plistic J2 ﬂow correction that can be 
disabled if not desired.  Damage is handled by trea ting the rank 4 elastic stiﬀness tensor 
as an evolving internal variable for the material.  Softening induced mesh dependencies 
are handled by a characteristic length method [Oliv er 1989]. 
 
Description of properties: 
1.  |u1D438 is the Young's modulus of the undamaged material a lso known as the virgin 
modulus. 
2.  /u1D̅08 is the Poisson's ratio of the undamaged material a lso known as the virgin 
Poisson's ratio. 
3.  |u1D4J3|u1D4JBCst is the initial principal tensile strength (stress)  of the material.  Once this 
stress has been reached at a point in the body a sm eared crack is initiated there 
with a normal that is co-linear with the 1 st  principal direction.  Once initiated, 
the crack is ﬁxed at that location, though it will convect with the motion of the 
body.  As the loading progresses the allowed tensil e traction normal to the 
crack plane is progressively degraded to a small ma chine dependent constant.  
The degradation is implemented by reducing the mate rial's modulus normal to 
the smeared crack plane according to a maximum diss ipation law that incorpo- 
rates exponential softening.  The restriction on th e normal tractions is given by 
/u1D̅1∫|u1D461Cst= (/u1D42ℜ⊗/u1D42ℜ ):σ− |u1D4J3|u1D4JBCst+ (1 − |u1D7≠≠)|u1D4J3|u1D4JBCst|parenleftCv11 − exp[−/u1D4:B |u1D6F+]|parenriµhtCv1 ≤ 0 
where /u1D42ℜ is the smeared crack normal, |u1D7≠≠ is the small constant, /u1D4:B is the softening 
modulus, and |u1D6F+ is an internal variable.  /u1D4:B is set automatically by the program; 
see |u1D4J4|u1D4J≠Cst below.  |u1D6F+ measures the crack ﬁeld intensity and is output in  the equiva- 
lent plastic strain ﬁeld, |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst, in a normalized fashion. *.   
 Property Value 
|u1D4J3|u1D4JBCst 450 psi 
|u1D4J3|u1D46≠Cst 2100 psi 
/u1D̅08 0.2 
|u1D4J4|u1D4J≠Cst 0.8 lbs/in 
|u1D6FD 0.03 
|u1D7≠2 0.0 psi-sec 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst 4200 psi 
 
For stability, values of |u1D7≠2 between 104 to 106 psi/sec are recommended.  Our l imited 
experience thus far has shown that many problems re quire nonzero values of |u1D7≠2 to run to 
avoid error terminations. 
 
Various other internal variables such as crack orie ntations and degraded stiﬀness 
tensors are internally calculated but currently not  available for output. *
