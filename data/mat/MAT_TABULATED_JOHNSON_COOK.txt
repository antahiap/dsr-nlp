LT.0.0: -NUMINT is percentage of integration points/layers 
which must fail before shell element fails.  For fu lly 
integrated shells, a layer fails if one integration  point 
fails .  Then, the given percentage of layers must fail 
before the element fails.  Only available for shell s.

recommended unless used in conjunction with 
*CONSTRAINED_TIED_NODES_FAILURE. 
LCK1 Load curv e ID or table ID. The load curve gives eﬀective str ess as 
a function of eﬀective plastic strain.  The table g ives for each 
plastic strain rate value a load curve ID specifyin g the 
(isothermal) eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀect ive plastic strain 
for that rate.  As in *.   *.   
 perature should be set using *INITIAL_STRESS_SOLID/ SHELL by setting 
history variable #14 for solid elements or history variable #10 for shell ele- 
ments. 
2.  Plastic Failure Strain.  Optional plastic failure strain is deﬁned as a func tion 
of triaxiality  |u1D4JD/|u1D7≠∆v m , Lode parameter, plastic strain rate  |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, temperature |u1D447 and 
initial element size /u1D45∫/c.st (square root of element area for shells and volume  over 
maximum area for solids) by

using load curves/tables LCF, LCG, LCH and LCI.  If  more than one of these 
four variables LCF, LCG, LCH and LCI are deﬁned, be  aware that the net plas- 
tic failure strain is essentially the product of mu ltiple functions as shown in the 
above equation.  This means that one and only one o f the variables LCF, LCG, 
LCH, and LCI can point to curve(s) that have plasti c strain along the curve 
ordinate.  The remaining nonzero variable(s) LCF, L CG, LCH, and LCI should 
point to curve(s) that have a unitless scaling fact or along the curve ordinate.   
A typical failure curve LCF for metal sheet, modele d with shell elements is 
shown in Figure M224-1 . Triaxiality should be monotonically increasing in  this 
curve.  A reasonable range for triaxiality is -2/3 to 2/3 if shell elements are 
used (plane stress).  For 3-dimensional stress stat es (solid elements), the possi- 
ble range of triaxiality goes from -∞ to +∞, but to  get a good resolution in the 
internal load curve discretization (depending on pa rameter LCINT of *CON-
TROL_SOLUTION) you should deﬁne lower limits, e.g. -1 to 1 if LCINT = 100 
(default).  plastic
