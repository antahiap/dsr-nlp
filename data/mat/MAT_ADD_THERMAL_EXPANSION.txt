meaning they describe thermal expansion in one dire ction.  The volumetric 
expansion coeﬃcient is three times the linear therm al expansion coeﬃcient.  
The regular thermal expansion coeﬃcients apply to t he soil skeleton and to 
drained parts.  Pore pressure can be generated due to the diﬀerence of expan- 
sion coeﬃcients of the soil skeleton and pore ﬂuid,  that is, if THEXP is not 
equal to three times the regular thermal expansion coeﬃcient for the part. *.   *MAT

Remarks: 
When invoking the isotropic thermal expansion prope rty (no local |u1D466 and /u1D46̅ parameters) 
for a material, the stress update is based on the e lastic strain rates given by 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J2Cst= |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst − |u1D6F+(|u1D447)|u1D447̇|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
rather than on the total strain rates |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . For a material with the stress based on the 
deformation gradient, |u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , the elastic part of the deformation gradient is us ed for the 
stress computations: 
|u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J2Cst=/u1D4:D|u1D447Cst−|oneCst/|threeCst|u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   , 
where /u1D4:D|u1D447Cst is the thermal Jacobian.  The thermal Jacobian is updated using the rate given 
by  
/u1D4:Ḋ|u1D447Cst= 3|u1D6F+(|u1D447)|u1D447̇/u1D4:D|u1D447Cst  . 
For orthotropic properties, which apply only to mat erials with anisotropy, these 
equations are generalized to 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J2Cst= |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst − |u1D6F+|u1D4J8Cst(|u1D447)|u1D447̇/u1D45E|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J8Cst /u1D45E|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst  
and 
|u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J2Cst= |u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J8Cst |u1D6FD|u1D4J9Cst−|oneCst|u1D444|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst |u1D444|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J9Cst   , 
where the |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst are updated as 
|u1D6FḊ|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D447)|u1D447̇|u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst  . 
Here /u1D45E|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  represents the matrix with material directions wit h respect to the current 
conﬁguration whereas |u1D444|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  are the corresponding directions with respect to t he initial 
conﬁguration.  For (shell) materials with multiple layers of diﬀerent anisotropy 
directions, the mid surface layer determines the or thotropy for the thermal expansion. *
