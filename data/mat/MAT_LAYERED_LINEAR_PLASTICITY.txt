  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
Table ID.  The table deﬁnes for each strain rate value a load curve 
ID giving the stress as a function of eﬀective plastic strain for that 
rate; see Figure M24-1 .  The stress as a function of eﬀective plastic 
strain curve for the lowest value of strain rate is  used if the strain 
rate falls below the minimum v alue.  Likewise, the stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain curve for the h ighest value of 
strain rate is used if the strain rate exceeds the maximum value.  
C, P, LCSR, EPS1 – EPS8, and ES1 – ES8 are ignored if a table ID is 
deﬁned. 
LCSR Load curve ID deﬁning strain rate scaling eﬀec t on yield stress 
EPS1 - EPS8 Eﬀective plastic strain values (optional if SIGY is  deﬁned).  At 
least 2 points should be deﬁned.  The ﬁrst point mu st be zero 
corresponding to the initial yield stress.  WARN ING: If the ﬁrst 
point is nonzero the yield stress is extrapolated t o determine the 
initial yield.  If this option is used, SIGY and ET AN are ignored 
and may be input as zero. 
ES1 - ES8 Corresponding yield stress values to EPS1  - EPS8. 
Remarks: 
The stress strain behavior may be treated by a bili near stress strain curve by deﬁning 
the tangent modulus, ETAN.  Alternately, a curve si milar to that shown in Figure M10-1  
is expected to be deﬁned by (EPS1, ES1) - (EPS8, ES 8); however, an eﬀective stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain curve (LCSS) ma y be input instead if eight points are 
insuﬃcient.  The cost is roughly the same for eithe r approach.  The most general 
approach is to use the table deﬁnition (LCSS) discu ssed below. 
Three options to account for strain rate eﬀects are  possible. 
1.  Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  , 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate; |u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
2.  For complete generality a load curve (LCSR) to sca le the yield stress may be 
input instead.  This curve deﬁnes the scale factor as a function of strain rate.   *
