AL restricted to linear softening.  It includes a b ilinear traction-separation law with a 
quadratic mixed mode delamination criterion and a d amage formulation.  This material 
model can be used only with cohesive element formul ations; see the variable ELFORM 
in *SECTION_SOLID and *SECTION_SHELL.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see*PART). 
RO Mass density 
ROFLG Flag stating whether density is speciﬁed per unit area or volume:  
EQ.0:  Speciﬁed density is per unit volume (default). 
EQ.1:  Speciﬁed density is per unit area for controlling t he mass 
of cohesive elements with an initial volume of zero . 
INTFAIL The number of integration points required for the c ohesive 
element to be deleted.  If it is zero, the element will not be deleted 
even if it satisﬁes the failure criterion.  The val ue of INT FAIL may 
range from 1 to 4, with 1 as the recommended value.

cohesive element *. AL

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
S Peak traction in tangential direction (mode II) 
STFSF Penetration stiﬀness multiplier for compressi on. Factor =(1.0+
STFSF)  is used to scale the compressive stiﬀness, i.e. no scaling is 
done with STFSF = 0.0 (recommended). 
TSLC2 Normalized traction-separation load curve ID for Mode II. The 
curve must be normalized in both coordinates and mu st contain 
at least three points: (0.0, 0.0) , (|u1D7≠6|zeroCst, 1.0) , and (1.0, 0.0) , which 
represents the origin, the peak and the complete fa ilure, 
respectively (see Figure M186-1 ). If not speciﬁed, TSLC is used for 
Mode II behavior as well. 
Remarks: 
All three formulations have in common that the trac tion-separation behavior of this 
model is mainly given by |u1D43A/u1D4:C.st|u1D4J≠Cst and T for normal mode I, |u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st|u1D4J≠Cst and S for tangential mode II 
and an arbitrary normalized traction-separation loa d curve for both modes (see Figure 
M186-1 ). The maximum (or failure) separations are then gi ven by: 
|u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st|u1D439Cst=|u1D43A/u1D4:C.st|u1D4J≠Cst
|u1D434TSLC × T  ,    |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st|u1D439Cst=|u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st|u1D4J≠Cst
|u1D434TSLC × S 
where |u1D434|u1D447Cst /u1D446.st |u1D43FCst /u1D4:6.st  is the area under the normalized traction-separati on curve given with 
TSLC. 
If TSLC2 is deﬁned

TSLC2. *. AL  
 If TSLC2 is defined this changes to : 
|u1D6FF|u1D439Cst=1 + |u1D6FD|twoCst

where |u1D6FD = |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st/|u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st is the “mode mixity”.  The larger the exponent XMU  is chosen, the 
larger the fracture toughness in mixed-mode situati ons will be.  In this model, damage 
of the interface is considered, i.e. irreversible c onditions are enforced with load- 
ing/unloading paths coming from/pointing to the ori gin.  This formulation is similar to
