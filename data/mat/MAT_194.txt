 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label n ot exceeding 8 
characters must be speciﬁed. 
RO Mass density 
E Young’s Modulus 
PR Poisson’s Ratio 
TMAX Ultimate in-plane shear stress.  If set to zer o, LS-DY NA will 
calculate TMAX based on the formulae in the Uniform  Building 
Code, using the data on card 2. See Remarks. 
FC Unconﬁned Compressive Strength of concrete (used in  the 
calculation of ultimate sh ear stress; crushing behavior is not 
modeled) 
PREF Percent reinforcement, e.g. if 1.2% reinforcem ent, enter 1.2 
FYIELD Yield stress of reinforcement 
SIG0 Overburden stress (in-plane compressive stress ) - used in the 
calculation of ultimate shear stress.  Usually sig0  is left as zero. *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
T1, T2, …, T5 Shear stress points on stress- strain curve.  By default these are 
calculated from the values on card 1. See below for  more 
guidance. 
AOPT Material axes option: 
EQ.0.0: locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes as shown in Figure M2-1 , and then ro- 
tated about the shell element normal by the angle B E-
TA.  Nodes 1, 2, and 4 of an element are identical to the 
nodes used for the deﬁnition of a coordinate system  as 
by *DEFINE_COORDINATE_NODES. 
EQ.2.0: globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR. 
EQ.3.0: applicable t o shell elements only.  This option 
determines locally orthotropic material axes by oﬀs et- 
ting the material axes by an angle to be speciﬁed f rom a 
line in the plane of the shell determined by taking  the 
cross product of the vector v deﬁned below with the
shell normal vector. 
LT.0.0: the absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VEC TOR).  Available in R3 version of 971 
and later. 
XP, YP, ZP Coordinates of point /u1D42∫ for AOPT = 1. 
A1, A2, A3 Components of vector /u1D41A for AOPT = 2. 
V1, V2, V3 Components of vector /u1D42F for AOPT = 3. 
D1, D2, D3 Components of vector /u1D41D for AOPT = 2. 
BETA Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 0 and 3, may be overridden 
on the element card, see *ELEMENT_SHELL_BETA. 
Remarks: 
The element is linear elastic except for in-plane s hear and tensile cracking eﬀects.  
Crushing due to direct compressive stresses are mod eled only insofar as there is an in-*.   
 Other terms are as above.  This formula is not incl uded in the material model: TMAX 
should be calculated by hand and entered on Card 1 if the Fukuzawa formula is 
required. 
 
It should be noted that none of the available formu lae, including Fukuzawa, predict the 
ultimate shear stress accurately for all situations .  Variance from the experimental 
results can be as great as 50%. 
 
The shear stress vs shear strain curve is then cons tructed automatically as follows, using 
the algorithm of Fukuzawa extended by Arup: 
1.  Assume ultimate engineering shear strain, |u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst= 0.004 8 
2.  First point on curve, corresponding to concrete cr acking, is at 
|parenleftCvJ0.3 ×TMAX 
|u1D43A, 0.3 × TMAX|parenriµhtCvJ, 
where |u1D43A is the elastic shear modulus given by 
|u1D43A =|u1D438
2(1 +/u1D̅08). 
3.  Second point, corresponding to the reinforcement y ield, is at 
(0.5 × |u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst, 0.8× TMAX). 
4.  Third point, corresponding to the ultimate strengt h, is at 
(|u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst, TMAX). 
5.  Fourth point, corresponding to the onset of streng th reduction, is at 
(2|u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst,TMAX). 
6.  Fifth point, corresponding to failure is at 
(3|u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst, 0.6 × TMAX). 
 
After failure, the shear stress drops to zero.  The  curve points can be entered by the user 
if desired, in which case they over-ride the automa tically calculated curve.  However, it 
is anticipated that in most cases the default curve  will be preferred due to ease of input.
