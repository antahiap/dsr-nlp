Remarks: 
A deﬂagration (burn rate) reactive ﬂow model requir es an unreacted solid equation of 
state, a reaction product equation of state, a reac tion rate law and a mixture rule for the 
two (or more) species.  The mixture rule for the st andard ignition and growth model 
[Lee and Tarver 1980] assumes that both pressures a nd temperatures are completely 
equilibrated as the reaction proceeds.  However, th e mixture rule can be modiﬁed to 
allow no thermal conduction or partial heating of t he solid by the reaction product 
gases.  For this relatively slow process of airbag propellant burn, the thermal and 
pressure equilibrium assumptions are valid.  The eq uations of state currently used in 
the burn model are the JWL, Gruneisen, the van der Waals co-volume, and the perfect 
gas law, but other equations of state can be easily  implemented.  In this propellant burn, 
the gaseous nitrogen produced by the burning sodium  azide obeys the perfect gas law 
as it ﬁlls the airbag but may have to be modeled as  a van der Waal’s gas at the high 
pressures and temperatures produced in the propella nt chamber.  The chemical reaction 
rate law is pressure, particle geometry and surface  area dependent, as are most high-
pressure burn processes.  When the temperature proﬁ le of the reacting system is well 
known, temperature dependent Arrhenius chemical kin etics can be used. 
 
Since the airbag propellant composition and perform ance data are company private 
information, it is very diﬃcult to obtain the requi red information for burn rate 
modeling.  However, Imperial Chemical Industries (I CI) Corporation supplied pressure 
exponent, particle geometry, packing density, heat of reaction, and atmospheric 
pressure burn rate data which allowed us to develop  the numerical model presented 
here for their NaN 3 + Fe 2O3 driver airbag propellant.  The deﬂagration model, its 
implementation, and the results for the ICI propell ant are presented in [Hallquist, et.al., 
1990].  
 *EOS_PROPELLANT_DEFLAGRATION  *EOS  
LS-DYNA R13 1-35 (EOS) The unreacted propellant and the reaction product e quations of state are both of the 
form: 
|u1D4JD = |u1D434|u1D4J2−|u1D44JCst |oneCsts|u1D449Csts+ |u1D43J|u1D4J2−|u1D44JCst |twoCsts|u1D449Csts+|u1D714|u1D436|u1D463Cst|u1D447Cst 
|u1D449 − |u1D4J1  , 
where |u1D4JD is pressure (in Mbars), |u1D449 is the relative speciﬁc volume (inverse of relativ e 
density), |u1D714 is the Gruneisen coeﬃcient, |u1D436|u1D463Cst is heat capacity (in Mbars -cc/cc°K), |u1D447 is the 
temperature in °K, |u1D4J1 is the co-volume, and |u1D434, |u1D43J, |u1D44J|oneCst and |u1D44J|twoCst  are constants.  Setting |u1D434 =
|u1D43J = 0  yields the van der Waal’s co-volume equation of st ate.  The JWL equation of state 
is generally useful at pressures above several kilo bars, while the van der Waal’s is 
useful at pressures below that range and above the range for which the perfect gas law 
holds.  Additionally, setting |u1D434 = |u1D43J = |u1D4J1 = 0  yields the perfect gas law.  If accurate values 
of |u1D714 and |u1D436|u1D463Cst plus the correct distribution between “cold” compr ession and internal 
energies are used, the calculated temperatures are very reasonable and thus can be used 
to check propellant performance. 
 
The reaction rate used for the propellant deﬂagrati on process is of the form: 
∂|u1D439
∂|u1D461= |u1D44D(1 − |u1D439)|u1D466Cst|u1D439|u1D46JCst|u1D4JD|u1D464Cst|uni23DFClft|uni23DFCex|uni23DFCex|uni23DFCmd|uni23DFCex|uni23DFCex|uni23DFCrt

|u1D439Cstlimit2 <|u1D439Cst<|oneCst 
where |u1D439 is the fraction reacted ( |u1D439 = 0  implies no reaction, |u1D439 = 1  is complete reaction), |u1D461 
is time, and |u1D4JD is pressure (in Mbars), |u1D4JF, |u1D46≠, |u1D462, |u1D464, |u1D46J, |u1D466, |u1D439limit1   and |u1D439limit2  are constants used 
to describe the pressure dependence and surface are a dependence of the reaction rates.  
Two (or more) pressure dependant reaction rates are  included in case the propellant is a 
mixture or exhibited a sharp change in reaction rat e at some pressure or temperature.  
Burning surface area dependencies can be approximat ed using the (1 − |u1D439)|u1D466Cst|u1D439|u1D46JCst terms.  
Other forms of the reaction rate law, such as Arrhe nius temperature dependent |u1D4J2−|u1D438Cst |u1D44JCst|u1D447Cst ⁄  
type rates, can be used, but these require very acc urate temperatures calculations.  
Although the theoretical justiﬁcation of pressure d ependent burn rates at kilobar type 
pressures is not complete, a vast amount of experim ental burn rate as a function of 
pressure data does demonstrate this eﬀect and hydro dynamic calculations using 
pressure dependent burn accurately simulate such ex periments. 
 
The deﬂagration reactive ﬂow model is activated by any pressure or particle velocity 
increase on one or more zone boundaries in the reac tive material.  Such an increase 
creates pressure in those zones and the decompositi on begins.  If the pressure is 
relieved, the reaction rate decreases and can go to  zero.  This feature is important for 
short duration, partial decomposition reactions.  I f the pressure is maintained, the 
fraction reacted eventually reaches one and the mat erial is completely converted to 
product molecules.  The deﬂagration front rates of advance through the propellant 
calculated by this model for several propellants ar e quite close to the experimentally 
observed burn rate versus pressure curves. 
 *EOS  *EOS_PROPELLANT_DEFLAGRATION  
1-36 (EOS) LS-DYNA R13 To obtain good agreement with experimental deﬂagrat ion data, the model requires an 
accurate description of the unreacted propellant eq uation of state, either an analytical ﬁt 
to experimental compression data or an estimated ﬁt  based on previous experience with 
similar materials.  This is also true for the react ion products equation of state.  The more 
experimental burn rate, pressure production and ene rgy delivery data available, the 
better the form and constants in the reaction rate equation can be determined. 
 
Therefore, the equation used in the burn subroutine  for the pressure in the unreacted 
propellant is 
|u1D443|u1D462Cst= R1 × |u1D4J2−R5×|u1D449Cst |u1D462Csts+ R2 × |u1D4J2−R6\|tCst|iCst|mCst|eCst|sCst |u1D449Cst |u1D462Csts+R3 × |u1D447|u1D462Cst
|u1D449|u1D462Cst− FRER   , 
where |u1D449|u1D462Cst and |u1D447|u1D462Cst are the relative volume and temperature respective ly of the unreacted 
propellant.  The relative density is obviously the inverse of the relative volume.  The 
pressure |u1D443|u1D4JDCst in the reaction products is given by: 
|u1D443|u1D4JDCst= A × |u1D4J2−XP1×|u1D449Cst |u1D4JDCsts+ B × |u1D4J2−XP2×|u1D449Cst |u1D4JDCsts+|u1D43A × |u1D447|u1D4JDCst
|u1D449|u1D443Cst− CCRIT   . 
As the reaction proceeds, the unreacted and product  pressures and temperatures are 
assumed to be equilibrated ( |u1D447|u1D462Cst= |u1D447|u1D4JDCst= |u1D447, |u1D443 = |u1D443|u1D462Cst= |u1D443|u1D4JDCst) while the relative volumes are 
additive: 
|u1D449 = (1 − |u1D439)|u1D449|u1D462Cst+ |u1D439|u1D449|u1D4JDCst  
where |u1D449 is the total relative volume.  Other mixture assum ptions can and have been 
used in diﬀerent versions of DYNA2D/3D.  The reacti on rate law has the form: 
|u1D71J|u1D439 
|u1D71J|u1D461 = GROW1 × (|u1D443 + FREQ)EM (|u1D439 + FMXIG)AR1 (1 − |u1D439 + FMIXG)ES1 
+ GROW2 × (|u1D443 + FREQ)EN (|u1D439 + FMIXG)AR2 (1 − |u1D439 + FMIXG)ES2   . 
If |u1D439 exceeds FMXGR, the GROW1 term is set equal to zero , and, if |u1D439 is less than FMN-
GR, the GROW2 term is zero.  Thus, two separate (or  overlapping) burn rates can be 
used to describe the rate at which the propellant d ecomposes. 
 
This equation of state subroutine is used together with a material model to describe the 
propellant.  In the airbag propellant case, a null material model (type #10) can be used.  
Material type 10 is usually used for a solid propel lant or explosive when the shear 
modulus and yield strength are deﬁned.  The propell ant material is deﬁned by the 
material model and the unreacted equation of state until the reaction begins.  The 
calculated mixture states are used until the reacti on is complete and then the reaction 
product equation of state is used.  The heat of rea ction,  ENQ, is assumed to be a 
constant and the same at all values of |u1D439 but more complex energy release laws could be 
implemented.

Remarks: 
The pore collapse model described in the TENSOR man ual [23] is no longer valid and 
has been replaced by a much simpler method.  This i s due in part to the lack of 
experimental data required for the more complex mod el.  It is desired to have a close 
approximation of the TENSOR model in the LS-DYNA co de to enable a quality link 
between them.  The TENSOR model deﬁnes two curves, the virgin loading curve and 
the completely crushed curve, as shown in Figure EOS11-1 , as well as the excess 
compression point required for pore collapse to beg in, |u1D7≠7|oneCst, and the excess compression 
point required to completely crush the material, |u1D7≠7|twoCst.  From this data and the maximum 
excess compression the material has attained, |u1D462max , the pressure for any excess 
compression, |u1D7≠7, can be determined. 
 
Unloading occurs along the virgin loading curve unt il the excess compression surpasses 
|u1D7≠7|oneCst.  After that, the unloading follows a path between the completely crushed curve and 
the virgin loading curve.  Reloading will follow th is curve back up to the virgin loading *EOS_TENSOR_PORE_COLLAPSE  *EOS

completely crushed curve.

The bulk sound speed is determined from the slope o f the completely crushed curve at 
the current pressure to avoid instabilities in the time step. 
 
The virgin loading and completely crushed curves ar e modeled with monotonic cubic-
splines.  An optimized vector interpolation scheme is then used to evaluate the cubic-
splines.  The bulk modulus and sound speed are deri ved from a linear interpolation on 
the derivatives of the cubic-splines. *EOS_IDEAL_GAS  *EOS

Purpose:  This is  Equation of State Form 12 for modeling ideal gas.  It is an alternate 
approach to using *EOS_LINEAR_POLYNOMIAL with C4 = C5 = (|u1D6F∆ − 1)  to model 
ideal gas.  This has a slightly improved energy acc ounting algorithm.

1.  Pressure.   The pressure in the ideal gas law is deﬁned as 
|u1D4JD = |u1D7≠+(|u1D436|u1D4JDCst− |u1D436|u1D463Cst)|u1D447
|u1D436|u1D4JDCst= |u1D436|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst+ |u1D436|u1D43FCst|u1D447 + |u1D436|u1D444Cst|u1D447|twoCst
|u1D436|u1D463Cst= |u1D436|u1D463Cst|zeroCst+ |u1D436|u1D43FCst|u1D447 + |u1D436|u1D444Cst|u1D447|twoCst 
where |u1D436|u1D4JDCst and |u1D436|u1D463Cst are the speciﬁc heat capacities at constant pressu re and at 
constant volume, respectively. |u1D7≠+ is the density.  The relative volume is deﬁned 
as 
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst=|u1D449
|u1D449|zeroCst=(|u1D449 |u1D44≠ ⁄ )
(|u1D449|zeroCst|u1D44≠ ⁄ )=|u1D71≠
|u1D71≠|zeroCst=|u1D7≠+|zeroCst
|u1D7≠+  , 
where |u1D7≠+|zeroCst is a nominal or reference density deﬁned in the *M AT_NULL card.  
The initial pressure can then be manually computed as 
|u1D443||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst  =   |u1D7≠+|dividesCv1|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst(|u1D436|u1D443Cst− |u1D436|u1D449Cst)|u1D447||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst
|u1D7≠+|dividesCv1|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst= |<raceleftCvJ|u1D7≠+|zeroCst
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst|<raceriµhtCvJ
|u1D443||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst  = |<raceleftCvJ|u1D7≠+|zeroCst
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst|<raceriµhtCvJ (|u1D436|u1D443Cst− |u1D436|u1D449Cst)|u1D447||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst 
The initial relative volume, |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst (V0), initial temperature, |u1D447||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst(T0), and heat 
capacity information are deﬁned in the *EOS_IDEAL_G AS input.  Note that 
the “reference” density is typically a density at a  non-stressed or nominal stress 
state.  The initial pressure should always be check ed manually against simula- 
tion result. 
2.  Energy Conservation.  With adiabatic ﬂag on, the adiabatic state is conse rved, 
but exact  internal energy conservation is sacriﬁced. 
3.  Deviation from Ideal Gas Model.   The ideal gas model is good for low density 
gas only.  Deviation from the ideal gas behavior ma y be indicated by the com- 
pressibility factor deﬁned as 
|u1D44D =|u1D443|u1D71≠ 
|u1D44J|u1D447  
When |u1D44D deviates from 1, the gas behavior deviates from id eal. 
4.  Initial Temperature and Initial Relative Volume.  V0 and T0 deﬁned in this 
card must be the same as the time-zero ordinates fo r the 2 load curves deﬁned 
in the *BOUNDARY_AMBIENT_EOS card, if it is used.  This is so that they 
both would consistently deﬁne the same initial stat e for a material. *EOS_PHASE_CHANGE  *EOS

This is  Equation of State Form 14.  The JWLB (Jones-Wilkens -Lee-Baker) equation of 
state, developed by Baker [1991] and further descri bed by Baker and Orosz [1991], 
describes the high pressure regime produced by over driven detonations while retaining 
the low pressure expansion behavior required for st andard acceleration modeling.  The 
derived form of the equation of state is based on t he JWL form due to its computational 
robustness and asymptotic approach to an ideal gas at high expansions.  Additional 
exponential terms and a variable Gruneisen paramete r have been added to adequately 
describe the high-pressure region above the Chapman -Jouguet state.

Remarks: 
1.  Model Overview.   This model is applicable to a wide range of mater ials, 
including those with pressure-dependent yield behav ior.  The use of 16 points 
in the yield stress as a function of eﬀective plast ic strain curve allows complex 
post-yield hardening behavior to be accurately repr esented.  In addition, the 
incorporation of an equation of state permits accur ate modeling of a variety of 0Piecewise linear curve defining
the yield stress versus effective
plastic strain.  As illustrated, the
yield stress at zero plastic strain
should be nonzero.σy

LS-DYNA R13 2-173 (MAT) b)  The maximum principal stress spall model, SPALL = 2, detects spall if the 
maximum principal stress, |u1D7≠∆max , exceeds the limiting value - |u1D4JDcut .  Note 
that the negative sign is required because |u1D4JDcut  is measured positive in 
compression, while |u1D7≠∆max  is positive in tension.  Once spall is detected wi th 
this model, the deviatoric stresses are reset to ze ro, and no hydrostatic 
tension ( |u1D4JD < 0 ) is permitted.  If tensile pressures are calculate d, they are 
reset to 0 in the spalled material.  Thus, the spal led material behaves as a 
rubble or incohesive material. 
c)  The hydrostatic tension spall model, SPALL = 3, de tects spall if the pres- 
sure becomes more tensile than the speciﬁed limit, |u1D4JDcut .  Once spall is de- 
tected the deviatoric stresses are reset to zero, a nd nonzero values of 
pressure are required to be compressive (positive).   If hydrostatic tension 
(|u1D4JD < 0 ) is subsequently calculated, the pressure is reset  to 0 for that ele- 
ment. *
