  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
WLFA Coeﬃcient for the Arrhenius and the Williams-L andel- Ferry shift 
functions.  Set to zero (along with WLFTREF and WLF B) to not 
apply scaling.  See Remark 2 . 
WLFB Coeﬃcient for the Williams-Landel- Ferry shift function.  Set to 
zero for the Arrhenius shift function or to not app ly scaling (to 
not apply scaling also set WLFTREF and WL FA to zero).  See 
Remark 2 . 
LCG0 Load curve ID deﬁning the instantaneous shear modulus, |u1D43A0, as a 
function of state of cure 
LCK0 Load curve ID deﬁning the instantaneous bulk m odulus, |u1D43∆0, as a 
function of state of cure 
IDOC Initial degree of cure, |u1D6F+/u1D4:C 
INCR Switch between incremental and total stress fo rmulation: 
EQ.0: Total form (default) 
EQ.1:  Incremental form (recommended) 
QCURE Heat generation factor, relating the heat generated  in one time 
step with the increment of the degree of cure in th at step  
Gi Shear relaxation modulus for the ith  term for fully cured material 
BETAG i Shear decay constant for the ith  term for fully cured material 
Ki Bulk relaxation modulus for the ith  term for fully cured material. 
BETAK i Bulk decay constant for the ith  term for fully cured material 
Remarks:  
1.  Material Formulation.  Within this material formulation an internal varia ble |u1D6F+ 
has been included to represent the degree of cure f or the adhesive.  The evolu- 
tion equation for this variable is given by the Kam al model and reads 
d|u1D6F+
dt = |parenleftCv4/u1D458|oneCst exp |parenleftCv4−/u1D450|oneCst
|u1D44J|u1D447 |parenriµhtCv4 +/u1D458|twoCst exp |parenleftCv4−/u1D450|twoCst
|u1D44J|u1D447 |parenriµhtCv4 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|parenriµhtCv4 (1 − |u1D6F+)|u1D4JBCst  . 
The chemical reaction of the curing process results  in a shrinkage of the mate- 
rial.  The coeﬃcient of the chemical shrinkage |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+)  can either be given by a 
load curve or by using the quadratic expression  *
