Purpose:  This is Material Type 194. It is for shel l elements only.  It uses empirically-
derived algorithms to model the eﬀect of cyclic she ar loading on reinforced concrete 
walls.  It is primarily intended for modeling squat  shear walls, but can also be used for 
slabs.  Because the combined eﬀect of concrete and reinforcement is included in the 
empirical data, crude meshes can be used.  The mode l has been designed such that the 
minimum amount of input is needed: generally, only the variables on the ﬁrst card need 
to be deﬁned. 
NOTE:  This material does not support speciﬁcation of a m a- 
terial angle, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst, for each through-thickness integra- 
tion point of a shell.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
UCONV Unit conversion factor.  UCONV is expected to  be set such that, 
U CON V =/radical.v11.0 PSI  in the model 's stress units . 
This used to convert the ultimate tensile stress of  concrete which 
is expressed as /radical.v1FC  where FC is given in PSI. Therefore a unit 
conversion factor of /radical.v1PSI Stress U nit ⁄ is required.  Examples: 
UCONV = 83.3 = /radical.v16 894  if stress unit is N/m|twoCst 
UCONV = 0.083 if stress unit is MN /m|twoCst or N/mm |twoCst  
ALPHA Shear span factor - see below. 
FT Cracking stress in direct tension - see notes below.  Default is 8% 
of the cylinder strength. 
ERIENF Young’s Modulus of reinforcement.  Used in c alculation of post-
cracked stiﬀness - see notes below. 
A Hysteresis constants determining the shape of the h ysteresis 
loops. 
B Hysteresis constants determining the shape of the h ysteresis 
loops. 
C Hysteresis constants determining the shape of the h ysteresis 
loops. 
D Hysteresis constants determining the shape of the hysteresis 
loops. 
E Hysteresis constants determining the shape of the h ysteresis 
loops. 
F Strength degradation factor.  After the ultimate sh ear stress has 
been achieved, F multiplies the maximum shear stres s from t he 
curve for subsequent reloading.  F = 1.0 implies no strength 
degradation (default).  F = 0.5 implies that the strength is halved 
for subsequent reloading.

these are calcu lated from the values on card 1. See below for more

 plane shear stress component.  It is not recommende d that this model be used where 
nonlinear response to direct compressive or loads i s important. 
 
Note that the in-plane shear stress |u1D461|u1D46JCst|u1D466Cst  is deﬁned as the shear stress in the element’s loc al 
|u1D46J-|u1D466 plane.  This is not necessarily equal to the maxim um shear stress in the plane: for 
example, if the principal stresses are at 45 degree s to the local axes, |u1D461|u1D46JCst|u1D466Cst  is zero.  
Therefore it is important to ensure that the local axes are appropriate - for a shear wall 
the local axes should be vertical or horizontal.  B y default, local |u1D46J points from node 1 to 
node 2 of the element.  It is possible to change th e local axes by using AOPT > 0. 
 
If TMAX is set to zero, the ultimate shear stress i s calculated using a formula in the 
Uniform Building Code 1997, section 1921.6.5: 
TMAX U BC =U CON V × ALP H A ×/radical.v1FC + RO × F Y  
where, 
U CON V = unit con v ersion factor, see v arria b le list 
ALP H A = aspect ratio 
= 2.0 for ℎ/u1D45∫⁄∈(2.0,∞) increases linearly to 3.0 for ℎ/u1D45∫⁄∈(2.0,1.5) 
FC = unconfined compressi v e strength of concrete 
RO = fraction of reinforcement 
= |parenleftCv1percent reinforcement|parenriµhtCv1 100 ⁄
F Y = yield stress of reinforcement   
To this we add shear stress due to the overburden t o obtain the ultimate shear stress: 
TMAX U BC = TMAX U BC + SIG0 
where 
SIG0 = in plane compressi v e stress under static e q uili b rium conditions 
 
The UBC formula for ultimate shear stress is genera lly conservative (predicts that the 
wall is weaker than shown in test), sometimes by 50 % or more.  A less conservative 
formula is that of Fukuzawa: 
TMAX = max |<racketleftCvJ|parenleftCvJ0.4 +|u1D434|u1D4J≠Cst
|u1D434|u1D464Cst|parenriµhtCvJ , 1|<racketriµhtCvJ× 2.7× |parenleftCvJ1.9+|u1D44≠
/u1D4:F|u1D463Cst|parenriµhtCvJ ×U CON V + /radical.v1FC + 0.5
× RO × F Y + SIG0 
where 
|u1D434/u1D4:6.st= Cross-sectional area of stiffening features such a s columns or flanges 
|u1D434|u1D464Cst= Cross-sectional area of wall 
|u1D44≠/u1D4:F|u1D463Cst⁄ = Aspect ratio of wall height length ⁄  *.   
 1.  Pre-cracking, linear elastic response is assumed u sing the overall Young’s 
Modulus on Card 1. 
2.  Cracking occurs in the local x or y directions when  the tensile stress in that 
direction exceeds the concrete tensile strength FT (if not input on Card 2, this 
defaults to 8% of the compressive strength FC).  Po st-cracking, a linear stress-
strain response is assumed up to reinforcement yiel d at a strain deﬁned by 
reinforcement yield stress divided by reinforcement  Young’s Modulus. 
3.  Post-yield, a constant stress is assumed (no work hardening). 
Unloading returns to the origin of the stress-strai n curve.  
For compressive strains the response is always line ar elastic using the overall 
Young’s Modulus on Card 1. 
If insuﬃcient data is entered, no cracking occurs i n the model.  As a minimum, 
FC and FY are needed. 
Extra variables are available for post-processing a s follows: 
Extra variable 1: Current engineering shear strain 
Extra variable 2: Shear status:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5– see below 
Extra variable 3: Maximum direct strain so far in l ocal |u1D46J direction (for ten- 
sile cracking) 
Extra variable 4: Maximum direct strain so far in l ocal |u1D466 direction (for ten- 
sile cracking)  
Extra variable 5: Tensile status: 0, 1 or 2 = elast ic, cracked, or yielded re- 
spectively. 
The shear status shows how far along the shear stre ss-strain curve each element 
has progressed, e.g. status 2 means that the elemen t has passed the second 
point on the curve.  These status levels correspond  to performance criteria in 
building design codes such as FEMA. *
