 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
PID Part ID of reinforced elements.  If PID = 0, the reinforcement is 
applied to all parts which use the Winfrith concret e model. 
AXIS Axis normal to layer: 
EQ.1: A and B are parallel to global |u1D466 and /u1D46̅, respectively. 
EQ.2: A and B are parallel to global |u1D46J and /u1D46̅, respectively. 
EQ.3: A and B are parallel to global |u1D46J and |u1D466, respectively. 
COOR Coordinate location of layer: 
AXIS.EQ.1: |u1D46J-coordinate 
AXIS.EQ.2: |u1D466-coordinate 
AXIS.EQ.3: /u1D46̅-coordinate 
RQA Reinforcement quantity (A). 
RQB Reinforcement quantity (B). 
Remarks: 
1.  Reinforcement Quantity.   Reinforcement quantity is the ratio of area of 
reinforcement in an element to the element's total cross-sectional area in a giv- 
en direction.  This deﬁnition is true for both Opti ons 1 and 2.  Where the op- 
tions diﬀer is in the manner in which it is decided  which elements are 
reinforced.  In Option 1, the reinforced element ID s are spelled out.  In Option *
