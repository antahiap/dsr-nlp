Model Description: 
CODAM2 is developed for modeling the nonlinear, pro gressive damage behavior of 
laminated ﬁber-reinforced plastic materials.  The m odel is based on the work by 
(Forghani, 2011; Forghani et al.  2011a; Forghani e t al.  2011b) and is an extension of the 
original model, CODAM (Williams et al.  2003). 
 
Brieﬂy, the model uses a continuum damage mechanics  approach and the following 
assumptions have been made in its development: 
1.  The material is an orthotropic medium consisting o f a number of repeating 
units through the thickness of the laminate, called  sub-laminates.  For example, 
[0/±45/90] is in a [0/±45/90] 8S  laminate. 
2.  The nonlinear behavior of the composite sub-lamina te is only caused by 
damage evolution.  Nonlinear elastic or plastic def ormations are not consid- 
ered. *.   
 The sign of the transverse normal strain plays a ve ry important role in the initiation and 
growth of damage since it indicates the compressive  or tensile nature of the transverse 
stress.  Therefore, the equivalent strain for the m atrix damage carries the sign of the 
transverse normal strain. 
 
Evolution of the overall damage mechanism (anti-loc king) is written in terms of the 
maximum principal strains: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D43FCste q = max|<racketleftCv1prn(ε)|<racketriµhtCv1  . 
Within the framework of non-local strain-softening formulations adopted here, all 
damage modes, be it intra-laminar (i.e. ﬁber and ma trix damage) or overall sub-
laminate modes are considered to be a function of t he non-local (averaged) equivalent 
strain deﬁned as: 
|u1D7≠≠̅/u1D6FC.ste q =/integral.v:|u1D7≠≠/u1D6FC.ste q (/u1D431)|u1D464/u1D6FC.st(/u1D41ℜ−/u1D431)|u1D4J1Ω
/Ome∧∙.st/u1D41ℜ  , 
where the subscript |u1D6F+ denotes the mode of damage: ﬁber ( |u1D6F+ = |u1D4J3 ) and matrix ( |u1D6F+ = |u1D4JA ) 
damage in each layer, /u1D458, within the sub-laminate or associated with the ov erall sub-
laminate, namely, locking ( |u1D6F+ =/u1D4:F).  Thus, for a given sub-laminate with n layers, |u1D7≠≠/u1D6FC.ste q  and 
|u1D7≠≠̅/u1D6FC.ste q  are vectors of size 2|u1D4JB + 1 .  /u1D41ℜ represents the position vector of the original poi nt of 
interest and /u1D431 denotes the position vector of all other points (G auss points) in the 
averaging zone denoted by Ω.  In classical isotropic non-local averaging appro ach, this 
zone is taken to be spherical (or circular in 2D) w ith a radius of |u1D4JF (named R1 in the 
material input card).  The parameter, |u1D4JF, which aﬀects the size of the averaging zone, 
introduces a length scale into the model that is li nked directly to the predicted size of 
the damage zone.  Averaging is done with a bell-sha ped weight function, |u1D464/u1D6FC.st, evaluated 
by 
|u1D464/u1D6FC.st=
⎣⎢⎡1 − |parenleftCvJ|u1D4J1
|u1D4JF|parenriµhtCvJ|twoCst
⎦⎥⎤|twoCst
  , 
where |u1D4J1 is the distance from the integration point of inte rest to another integration point 
within the averaging zone. 
 
The damage parameters, |u1D714/u1D6FC.st, are calculated as a function of the corresponding  averaged 
equivalent strains.  In CODAM2 the damage parameter s are assumed to grow as a 
hyperbolic function of the damage potential (non-lo cal equivalent strains) such that 
when used in conjunction with stiﬀness reduction fa ctors that vary linearly with the 
damage parameters they result in a linear strain-so ftening response (or a bilinear stress-
strain curve) for each mode of damage

where superscripts |u1D4J6 and |u1D46≠ denote, respectively, the damage initiation and sa turation 
values of the strain quantities to which they are a ssigned.  The initiation and saturation *.   
 when the magnitude of the ﬁrst principal strain is greater than the magnitude of the 
third principal strain and in compression when the third principal strain is larger.  
When R1 > 0, the ERODE = 1 criterion is checked usi ng the non-local (averaged) 
principal strain.  For ERODE = 2, the erosion crite rion is met when the local (non-
averaged) maximum principal strain exceeds ERPAR2.  For ERODE = 3, both of these 
erosion criteria are checked.  For visualization pu rposes, the ratio of the maximum 
principal strain over the limit is stored in the lo cation of plastic strain which is written 
by default to the elout  and d3plot  ﬁles. 
History Variables: 
History variables for CODAM2 are enumerated in the following tables.  To include 
them in the d3plot  database, use NEIPH (bricks) or NEIPS (shells) on *DATABASE_EX-
TENT_BINARY.  For brick elements, add 4 to the vari able numbers in the table because 
the ﬁrst 6 history variables are reserved.
