PR Poisson’s ratio (> .49 is recommended, smaller valu es may not 
work and should not be used).  If this is set to a negative number, 
then the absolute value is used and an extra card is read for the 
Mullins eﬀect.

EQ.0:  set hyperelastic constants directly. 
EQ.1: solve for C10 and C01.

EQ.3: solve for C10, C01, C11, C20, C02, and C30. 
NV Number of Prony series terms used in ﬁtting curve L CID2.  If 
zero, the default is 6.  Currently, the maximum num ber is set to 
12.  Values less than 12, possibly 3 - 5 are recommended, since 
each term used adds signiﬁ cantly to the cost.  Caution should be 
exercised when taking the results from the ﬁt.  Pre ferably, all 
generated coeﬃcients should be positive.  Negative values may 
lead to unstable results.  Once a satisfactory ﬁt h as been achieved 
it is recommended t hat the coeﬃcients which are written into the 
output ﬁle be input in future runs. 
G Shear modulus for frequency independent damping.  F requency 
independent damping is based on a spring and slider  in series.  
The critical stress for the slider mechanism is SIGF deﬁned below.  
For the best results, the value of G should be 250 - 1000 times 
greater than SIGF.

THERML Flag for the thermal option.  If THERML > 0.0, then G, SIGF, C10 
and C01 must all specify curve IDs (zero is not permitted) that 
deﬁne the values as functions of temperature.  If T HERML < 0.0, 
then G, SIGF, C10 and C01, C11, C20, C02, and C30 m ust all 
specify curve IDs (zero is not permitted) that deﬁn e the values as 
functions of temp erature.  A ‘ﬂat’ curve may be used to deﬁne a 
constant value that does not change with temperatur e.  This 
thermal option is available only for solid elements .

 In order to prevent volumetric work from contributi ng to the hydrostatic work the ﬁrst 
and second invariants are modiﬁed as shown.  This p rocedure is described in more 
detail by Sussman and Bathe [1987].  The second Pio la-Kirchhoﬀ and Cauchy stress 
tensors are obtained from the strain energy functio nal as 
/u1D4̅A=|u1D71J /u1D44A 
|u1D71J/u1D46C,        /u1D̅48/u1D44A.st=1
/u1D4:D/u1D46D/u1D4̅A/u1D46D|u1D447Cst, 
where /u1D46C is the Green strain tensor and /u1D46D is the deformation gradient.  We use the 
subscript /u1D44A here to denote the contribution from the strain en ergy potential, and with 
no other contributions the resulting Cauchy stress is simply 
/u1D̅48=/u1D̅48/u1D44A.st. 
 
Rate eﬀects are taken into account through linear v iscoelasticity by adding a sequence 
of stress contributions 
/u1D̅48|u1D449Cst= |summationCv1/u1D̅48|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst 
where each term is known as a Prony  term.  Each such stress component /u1D̅48|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst evolves 
with deformation and time as 
|parenleftCv2/u1D̅48|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst|parenriµhtCv2/u1D6FB.st= 2|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|parenleftCv2/u1D46B− |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts(|u1D461Cst−|u1D461Cst |zeroCsts)|u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst/u1D̅:A|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst|parenriµhtCv2,        |parenleftCv2/u1D̅:A|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst|parenriµhtCv2/na˙la.st= |u1D4J2/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts(|u1D461Cst−|u1D461Cst |zeroCsts)/u1D46B. 
Here ∇ denotes the Jaumann rate. /u1D46B is  the rate-of-deformation tensor, |u1D461 is time and |u1D461|zeroCst is 
an arbitrary time point.  Each term has an internal  strain /u1D̅:A|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst associated with itself, which 
incorporates the memory properties a viscoelastic m aterial typically possesses.  This 
stress is added to the stress tensor determined fro m the strain energy functional, so that 
/u1D̅48=/u1D̅48/u1D44A.st+/u1D̅48|u1D449Cst. 
 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of dampers and springs in 
series. An arbitrary number of such Prony terms can  be input, each characterized by the 
shear modulus, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and relaxation coeﬃcient, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst. To avoid a constant shear modulus 
from this viscoelastic formulation, a term in the s eries is included only when  |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst> 0. 
 
For the sake of understanding the inﬂuence these te rms have on the rate eﬀects of 
viscoelasticity, let’s investigate the model in a s ituation with no spin and constant rate-
of-deformation with /u1D46B≠/u1D̅CE. This means that the Jaumann rate is simply diﬀere ntiation 
with time, and we can look at the implications a sp eciﬁc term has.  To make some 
physical sense of things, we deal with both the no hyperelastic material present and the 
hyperelastic material present cases.  For the latte r we assume an elastic shear modulus, 
|u1D43A, for the hyperelastic material.  
1.  Constant strain rate, /u1D46B. For the special case of constant strain rate, /u1D46B, we 
have the following expression for the stress rate 
/u1D̅48̇|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst= 2|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts|u1D461Cst/u1D46B, *. TIC_RUBBER  
 shape of the relaxation curve.  This can also be us ed as a basis for estimating 
material parameters. 
 
 
3.  Creep.  For creep, we assume the same situation but instea d of prescribing the 
strain rate, /u1D46B, we enforce the stress, /u1D̅48, to be constant after time |u1D461|zeroCst. The expres- 
sion for the creep strain, /u1D̅:A|u1D4J≠Cst, in the non-presence of a hyperelastic material be - 
comes 
/u1D̅:A|u1D4J≠Cst=|u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst
2|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D461 − |u1D461|zeroCst)/u1D̅48|zeroCst|u1D4J6Cst, 
which indicates that the creep strain evolves linea rly with time (see Fig- 
ure M77-3 ). This is a rather non-physical behavior, but in t he presence of a 
hyperelastic material the creep evolves as 
/u1D̅:A|u1D4J≠Cst=1
2|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cstln /˙raceleft.v6|u1D43A + |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst
|u1D43A + |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts(|u1D461Cst−|u1D461Cst |zeroCsts)/˙raceright.v6/u1D̅48|zeroCst|u1D4J6Cst 
and saturates as one would expect to a constant val ue.  With many such terms, 
the creep evolves in a quantitatively diﬀerent mann er, but the qualitative be- 
havior is to be understood as described. 
 
The Mooney-Rivlin rubber model (model 27) is obtain ed by specifying /u1D441= 1.  Despite 
the diﬀerences in formulations, we ﬁnd that the res ults obtained with this model are 
nearly identical with those of material 27 as long as large values of Poisson’s ratio are 
used. 
 
Frequency independent damping is obtained by having  a spring and slider in series as 
shown in the following sketch:
