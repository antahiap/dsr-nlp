2.  FOFFS.  FOFFS oﬀsets the yield surface parallel to the axia l force axis.  It is the 
compressive axial force at which the maximum bendin g moment capacity 
about the local |u1D46≠-axis (determined by LCPMS and SFS) and that about the local 
|u1D461-axis (determined by LCPMT and SFT) occur.  For ste el beams and columns, 
the value of FOFFS is usually zero.  For reinforced  concrete beams, columns 
and shear walls, the maximum bending moment capacit y occurs correspond- 
ing to a certain compressive axial force, FOFFS. Th e value of FOFFS can be 
input as either positive or negative.  Internally, LS-DYNA converts FOFFS to, 
and regards compressive axial force as, negative. 
3.  FTYPE 4.   Interaction surface FTYPE 4 calculates a utilisat ion parameter using 
the yield force and moment data given on Card 2, bu t the elements remain 
elastic even when the forces or moments exceed yiel d values.  This is done for 
consistency with the design code OBE AISC LRFD (200 0).  The utilization cal- 
culation is as follows: 
U tili zation =|u1D43∆|oneCst|u1D439
/u1D̅1∫|u1D439|u1D466Cst+|u1D43∆|twoCst

 5.  DEGRAD.   The option for degrading moment behavior changes the meaning of 
the plastic moment-rotation curve as follows: 
a)  If DEGRAD = 0 (not recommended), the |u1D46J-axis points on the curve repre- 
sent current plastic rotation (meaning total rotati on minus the elastic 
component of rotation).  This quantity can be posit ive or negative depend- 
ing on the direction of rotation; during hysteresis  the behavior will repeat- 
edly follow backwards and forwards along the same c urve.  The curve 
should include negative and positive rotation and m oment values.  This 
option is retained so that results from existing mo dels will be unchanged. 
b)  If DEGRAD = 1, the |u1D46J-axis points represent cumulative absolute plastic 
rotation.  This quantity is always positive and inc reases whenever there is 
plastic rotation in either direction.  Thus, during  hysteresis, the yield mo- 
ments are taken from points in the input curve with  increasingly positive 
rotation.  If the curve shows a degrading behavior (reducing moment with 
rotation), then, once degraded by plastic rotation,  the yield moment can 
never recover to its initial value.  This option ca n be thought of as having 
“fatigue-type” hysteretic damage behavior, where al l plastic cycles con- 
tribute to the total damage. 
c)  If DEGRAD = 2, the |u1D46J-axis points represent the high-tide value (always 
positive) of the plastic rotation.  This quantity i ncreases only when the ab- 
solute value of plastic rotation exceeds the previo usly recorded maximum.  
If smaller cycles follow a larger cycle, the plasti c moment during the small 
cycles will be constant, since the high-tide plasti c rotation is not altered by 
the small cycles.  Degrading moment-rotation behavi or is possible.  This 
option can be thought of as showing rotation-contro lled damage and fol- 
lows the FEMA approach for treating fracturing join ts. 
DEGRAD applies also to the axial behavior.  The sam e options are available as 
for rotation: DEGRAD = 0 gives unchanged behavior f rom previous versions; 
DEGRAD = 1 gives a fatigue-type behavior using cumu lative plastic strain; 
and DEGRAD = 2 gives FEMA-type behavior, where the axial load capacity 
depends on the high-tide tensile and compressive st rains.  The deﬁnition of 
strain for this purpose is according to ASFLAG on C ard 1 – it is expected that 
ASFLAG = 2 will be used with DEGRAD = 2. The “axial  strain” variable plot- 
ted by post-processors is the variable deﬁned by AS FLAG. 
The output variables plotted as “plastic rotation” have special meanings for 
this material model– note that hinges form only at Node 2.  “Plastic rotation at 
End 1” is really a high-tide mark of absolute plast ic rotation at Node 2, deﬁned 
as follows: 
a)  Current plastic rotation is the total rotation min us the elastic component 
of rotation. *
