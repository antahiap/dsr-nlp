more eﬃcient.  Whenever possible, Material 12 is re commended for solid ele- 
ments, but for shell elements, it is less accurate and thus Material 12 is not rec- 
ommended in this case.

This is  Material Type 12.  This is a very low cost isotropi c plasticity model for three-
dimensional solids.  In the plane stress implementa tion for shell elements, a one-step 
radial return approach is used to scale the Cauchy stress tensor if the state of stress 
exceeds the yield surface.  This approach to plasti city leads to inaccurate shell thickness 
updates and stresses after yielding.  This is the o nly model in LS-DYNA for plane stress 
that does not default to an iterative approach.
