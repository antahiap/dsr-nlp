  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
RECOV The modulus is recovered in compression when RE COV is equal 
to 0.0 (default).  The modulus remains at the britt le damage level 
when RE COV is equal to 1.0.  Partial recovery is modeled f or 
values of RECOV between 0.0 and 1.0.  Two options a re available:  
1.  If RE COV is a value between 0.0 and 1.0, then recovery i s 
based upon the sign of the pressure invariant only.  
2.  If RE COV is a value between 10.0 and 11.0, then recovery  
is based upon the sign of both the pressure and vol umet- 
ric strain.  In this case, RECO V =RECO V −10 , and a 
ﬂag is set to request the volumetric strain check. 
IRETRC Cap retraction option: 
EQ.0: Cap does not retract (default). 
EQ.1: Cap retracts.

Remarks: 
1.  Model Overview.   This is a cap model with a smooth intersection be tween the 
shear yield surface and hardening cap, as shown in Figure M159-1 .  The initial 
damage surface coincides with the yield surface.  R ate eﬀects are modeled with 
viscoplasticity.  For a complete theoretical descri ption, with references and 
example problems see [Murray 2007] and [Murray, Abu -Odeh and Bligh 2007]. 
2.  Stress Invariants.   The yield surface is formulated in terms of three  stress 
invariants: /u1D4:D|oneCst which is the ﬁrst invariant of the stress tensor, /u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst which is the 
second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, a nd /u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst which is the third invar- 
iant of the deviatoric stress tensor.  The invarian ts are deﬁned in terms of the 
deviatoric stress tensor,  |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , and pressure, |u1D443, as follows: *.   
 5.  Rubin Scaling Function.   Concrete fails at lower values of /radical.v23/u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst (principal 
stress diﬀerence) for triaxial extension (TXE) and torsion (TOR) tests than it 
does for TXC tests conducted at the same pressure.  The Rubin scaling func- 
tion, ℜ, determines the strength of concrete for any state  of stress relative to the 
strength for TXC, using ℜ|u1D439/f.st.  Strength in torsion is modeled as |u1D444|oneCst|u1D439/f.st.  Strength 
in TXE is modeled as |u1D444|twoCst|u1D439/f.st, where:  
|u1D444|oneCst= |u1D6F+|oneCst− |u1D7≠6|oneCstexp|parenleftCv1−|u1D6FD|oneCst/u1D4:D|oneCst|parenriµhtCv1 +/u1D̅0:|oneCst/u1D4:D|oneCst
|u1D444|twoCst= |u1D6F+|twoCst− |u1D7≠6|twoCstexp|parenleftCv1−|u1D6FD|twoCst/u1D4:D|oneCst|parenriµhtCv1 +/u1D̅0:|twoCst/u1D4:D|oneCst 
6.  Cap Hardening Surface.   The strength of concrete is modeled by a combina-
tion of the cap and shear surfaces in the low to hi gh conﬁning pressure re- 
gimes.  The cap is used to model plastic volume cha nge related to pore collapse 
(although the pores are not explicitly modeled).  T he isotropic hardening cap is 
a two-part function that is either unity or an elli pse: 
|u1D439|u1D4J≠Cst( /u1D4:D|oneCst,/u1D̅05 ) = 1 −[/u1D4:D|oneCst−/u1D4:F (/u1D̅05)][ |/u1D4:D|oneCst−/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05)| +/u1D4:D|oneCst−/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) ]
2  [/u1D44B(/u1D̅05) −/u1D4:F (/u1D̅05)] |twoCst  , 
where /u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) is deﬁned as: 
/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) = |<raceleftCvJ/u1D̅05 if    /u1D̅05>/u1D̅05|zeroCst
/u1D̅05|zeroCstotherwise  
The equation for |u1D439|u1D4J≠Cst is equal to unity for /u1D4:D|oneCst≤/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05).  It describes the ellipse for 
/u1D4:D|oneCst>/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05). The intersection of the shear surface and the cap  is at /u1D4:D|oneCst=/u1D̅05.  /u1D̅05|zeroCst is the 
value of /u1D4:D|oneCst at the initial  intersection of the cap and shear surfaces before hard- 
ening is engaged (before the cap moves).  The equat ion for /u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) restrains the 
cap from retracting past its initial location at /u1D̅05|zeroCst. 
The intersection of the cap with the /u1D4:D|oneCst axis is at /u1D4:D|oneCst=/u1D44B(/u1D̅05).  This intersection 
depends upon the cap ellipticity ratio |u1D44J, where |u1D44J is the ratio of its major to 
minor axes: 
/u1D44B(/u1D̅05) =/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) + |u1D44J|u1D439/u1D45:.st[/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05)] . 
The cap moves to simulate plastic volume change.  T he cap expands ( /u1D44B(/u1D̅05) and 
/u1D̅05 increase) to simulate plastic volume compaction.  The cap contracts ( /u1D44B(/u1D̅05) 
and /u1D̅05 decrease) to simulate plastic volume expansion, ca lled dilation.   The 
motion (expansion and contraction) of the cap is ba sed upon the hardening 
rule: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst|u1D4JDCst=/u1D44A/˙racketleft.v:1 − |u1D4J2−/u1D4:̅.st|oneCsts(/u1D44B.st−/u1D44B.st|zeroCsts)−/u1D4:̅.st|twoCsts(/u1D44B.st−/u1D44B.st|zeroCsts)|twoCsts/˙racketright.v:  . 
Here |u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst|u1D4JDCst is the plastic volume strain, /u1D44A is the maximum plastic volume strain, 
and |u1D437|oneCst and |u1D437|twoCst are model input parameters.  /u1D44B|zeroCst is the initial location of the cap 
when /u1D̅05=/u1D̅05|zeroCst. 
The ﬁve input parameters ( /u1D44B|zeroCst, /u1D44A, |u1D437|oneCst, |u1D437|twoCst, and |u1D44J) are obtained from ﬁts to the 
pressure-volumetric strain curves in isotropic comp ression and uniaxial strain. *.

The damage parameter that is applied to the six str esses is equal to the current 
maximum of the brittle or ductile damage parameter.   The parameters |u1D434 and |u1D43J 
or |u1D436 and |u1D437 set the shape of the softening curve plotted as st ress-displacement 
or stress-strain.   The parameter |u1D4J1max  is the maximum damage level that can be 
attained.  It is internally calculated and is less than one at moderate conﬁning 
pressures.  See [Murray 2007] for a description of how |u1D4J1max  is calculated for 
diﬀerent loading regimes.  The compressive softenin g parameter, |u1D434, may also 
be reduced with conﬁnement, using the input ﬁeld PM OD, as follows: 
|u1D434 = |u1D434(|u1D4J1max + 0.001)PMOD  
9.  Regulating Mesh Size Sensitivity.   The concrete model maintains constant 
fracture energy, regardless of element size.  The f racture energy is deﬁned here 
as the area under the stress-displacement curve fro m peak strength to zero 
strength.  This is done by internally formulating t he softening parameters |u1D434 
and |u1D436 (see Remark 8 ) in terms of the element length,  /u1D45∫ (cube root of the element 
volume), the fracture energy, |u1D43A/f.st, the initial damage threshold, /u1D̅0F|zeroCst|u1D461Cst or /u1D̅0F|zeroCst|u1D4J≠Cst, and 
the softening shape parameters, |u1D437 or |u1D43J. 
The fracture energy is calculated from up to ﬁve us er-speciﬁed input ﬁelds: 
GFC, GFS, GFT, PWRC, and PWRT.  The user speciﬁes t hree distinct fracture 
energy values.  These are the fracture energy in un iaxial tensile stress, GFT; 
pure shear stress, GFS; and uniaxial compressive st ress, GFC.  The model in- 
ternally selects the fracture energy from equations  which interpolate between 
the three fracture energy values as a function of t he stress state (expressed us- 
ing two stress invariants).  The interpolation equa tions depend upon the user-
speciﬁed input powers PWRC and PWRT, as follows:

10.  Element Erosion.   An element loses all strength and stiﬀness as |u1D4J1→1.  To 
prevent computational diﬃculties with very low stiﬀ ness, element erosion is *.
