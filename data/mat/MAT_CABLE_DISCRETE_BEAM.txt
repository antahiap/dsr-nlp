This is Material Type 71.  This model permits elast ic cables to be realistically modeled; 
thus, no force will develop in compression.

speciﬁed (see *PART).

engineering strain.  (Optional). 
F0 Initial tensile force.  If F0 is deﬁned, an oﬀset i s not needed for an 
initial tensile force.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
TRAMP Ramp-up time for pre-tension force 
IREAD Set to 1 to read second line of input 
OUTPUT Flag = 1 to output axial strain (see note be low concerning OUT-
PUT) 
TSTART Time at which the ramp-up of pre-tension beg ins 
FRACL0 Fraction of initial length that should be reached o ver time period 
of TRAMP. Corresponding tensile force builds up as necessary to 
reach cable length = FRACL0 × L0 at time t = TRAMP. 
MXEPS Maximum strain at failure 
MXFRC Maximum force at failure 
Remarks: 
The force, F, generated by the cable is nonzero if and only if the cable is tension.  The 
force is given by: 
|u1D439 = max(|u1D439|zeroCst+ |u1D43∆∆/u1D4:F, 0. ) 
where ∆L is the change in length  
∆/u1D4:F= current length − |parenleftCv1initial length − offset|parenriµhtCv1 
and the stiﬀness (E > 0.0 only ) is deﬁned as: 
|u1D43∆ =|u1D438 × area 
|parenleftCv1initial length − offset|parenriµhtCv1 
Note that a constant force element can be obtained by setting: 
|u1D439|zeroCst> 0 and |u1D43∆ = 0 
although the application of such an element is unkn own. 
 
The area and oﬀset are deﬁned on either the cross s ection or element cards.  For a slack 
cable the oﬀset should be input as a negative lengt h.  For an initial tensile force the 
oﬀset should be positive. 
 
If a load curve is speciﬁed the Young’s modulus wil l be ignored and the load curve will 
be used instead.  The points on the load curve are deﬁned as engineering stress versus 
engineering strain, i.e., the change in length over  the initial length.  The unloading 
behavior follows the loading.
