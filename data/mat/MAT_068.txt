 2.  Plastic Displacement.   The plastic displacement for the load curves is d eﬁned 
as: 
plastic displacement = total displacement − yield force /elastic stiffness  . 
3.  Discrete Beam Formulation.   The formulation of the discrete beam (type 6) 
assumes that the beam is of zero length and require s no orientation node.  A 
small distance between the nodes joined by the beam  is permitted.  The local 
coordinate system which determines (|u1D4JF, |u1D46≠, |u1D461)  is given by the coordinate ID (see 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_ OPTION ) in the cross-sectional input (see *SEC-
TION_BEAM) where the global system is the default.  The local coordinate 
system axes can rotate with either node of the beam  or an average rotation of 
both nodes (see SCOOR variable in *SECTION_BEAM). 
4.  Failure.   Catastrophic failure based on force resultants oc curs if the following 
inequality is satisﬁed.

After failure, the discrete element is deleted.  Li kewise, catastrophic failure 
based on displacement resultants occurs if the foll owing inequality is satisﬁed:

+ |parenleftCv6/u1D̅0:|u1D461Cst
/u1D̅0:|u1D461Cstfail |parenriµhtCv6|twoCst
− 1. ≥ 0. 
After failure the discrete element is deleted.  If failure is included, either or 
both of the criteria may be used.
