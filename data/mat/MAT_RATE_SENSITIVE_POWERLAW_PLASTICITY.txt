This is Material Type 64 which will model strain ra te sensitive elasto-plastic material 
with a power law hardening.  Optionally, the coeﬃci ents can be deﬁned as functions of 
the eﬀective plastic strain.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
E Young’s modulus of elasticity 
PR Poisson’s ratio 
K Material constant, /u1D458.  If K < 0, the absolute value of K is taken as 
the load curve number that deﬁnes /u1D458 as a function of eﬀective 
plastic strain. 
M Strain hardening coeﬃcient, |u1D4JA.  If M < 0, the absolute value of M 
is taken as the load curve number that deﬁnes |u1D4JA as a function of 
eﬀective plastic strain. *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
N Strain rate sensitivity coeﬃcient, |u1D4JB. If N < 0, the absolute value of 
N is taken as the load curve number that deﬁnes |u1D4JB as a function of 
eﬀective plastic strain. 
E0 Initial strain rate (default = 0.0002) 
VP Formulation for rate eﬀects: 
EQ.0.0: Scale yield stress (default) 
EQ.1.0: Viscoplastic formulation 
EPS0 Quasi-static threshold strain rate.  See descr iption under *.   *
