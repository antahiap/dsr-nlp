 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
FLCID Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_CURVE).   
TYPE.EQ.0: this curve deﬁnes force or moment as a function of 
deﬂection for nonlinear elastic behavior.   
TYPE.EQ.1: this curve deﬁnes the yield force as a function of 
plastic deﬂection.  If the abscissa of the ﬁrst poi nt 
of the curve is 0. the force magnitude i s identical in 
tension and compression, that is, only the sign 
changes.  If not, the yield stress in the compressi on 
is used when the spring force is negative.  The 
plastic displacement increases monotonically in 
this implementation.  The load curve is req uired 
input. 
HLCID Optional load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning force as a 
function of relative velocity.  If the origin of th e curve is at (0,0) , 
the force magnitude is identical for a given magnit ude of the 
relative velocity, meaning only the sign changes. 
C1 Damping coeﬃcient 
C2 Damping coeﬃcient 
DLE Factor to scale time units 
GLCID Optional load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning a scale 
factor as a function of deﬂection for load curve ID , HLCID.  If 
zero, a scale factor of unity is assumed. 
Remarks: 
1.  Elastic Behavior.   If TYPE = 0, elastic behavior is obtained.  In th is case, if the 
linear spring stiﬀness is used, the force, |u1D439, is given by: 
|u1D439 = K × ∆/u1D4:F+ D × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ  . 
But if the load curve ID is speciﬁed, the force is then given by: *.   
 |u1D439|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D439 × |<racketleftCv61 + C1 × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ+ C2 × sgn|parenleftCv1∆/u1D4:Ḟ|parenriµhtCv1ln |parenleftCv6max /˙raceleft.v61. ,|dividesCv2∆/u1D4:Ḟ|dividesCv2
DLE /˙raceright.v6|parenriµhtCv6|<racketriµhtCv6 + D × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ
+ |u1D4J4(∆/u1D4:F)ℎ|parenleftCv1∆/u1D4:Ḟ|parenriµhtCv1  . 
Unless the origin of the curve starts at (0,0) , the negative part of the curve is 
used when the spring force is negative where the ne gative of the plastic dis- 
placement is used to interpolate, |u1D439|u1D466Cst.  The positive part of the curve is used 
whenever the force is positive.  
3.  Cross-Sectional Area.  The cross-sectional area is deﬁned on the section c ard 
for the discrete beam elements, See *SECTION_BEAM.  The square root of this 
area is used as the contact thickness oﬀset if thes e elements are included in the 
contact treatment. 
4.  Rotational Displacement.   Rotational displacement is measured in radians. *
