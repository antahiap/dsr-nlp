 of strain for uniaxial tension in the rolling direc tion, VLCID curve should give 
the relative volume change as function of strain fo r uniaxial tension in the roll- 
ing direction and load curve given by -E should giv e the Young’s modulus as 
function of strain for uniaxial tension in the roll ing direction.  Optionally the 
curve can be substituted for a table deﬁning harden ing as function of plastic 
strain rate (HR = 3) or temperature (HR = 8). 
2.  Exceptions from the rule above are curves deﬁned a s functions of plastic strain 
in the 45 and 90 directions, i.e., P1 and P2 for HR  = 7 and negative R45 or R90. 
The hardening curves are here deﬁned as measured st ress as function of meas- 
ured plastic strain for uniaxial tension in the dir ection of interest, i.e., as deter- 
mined from experimental testing using a standard pr ocedure.  Moreover, the 
curves deﬁning the R values are as function of the measured plastic strain for 
uniaxial tension in the direction of interest.  The se curves are transformed in- 
ternally to be used with the eﬀective stress and st rain properties in the actual 
model.  The eﬀective plastic strain does not coinci de with the plastic strain 
components in other directions than the rolling dir ection and may be some- 
what confusing to the user.  Therefore the von Mise s work equivalent plastic 
strain is output as history variable #2 if HR = 7 o r if any of the R-values is de- 
ﬁned as function of the plastic strain. 
3.  The R-values in curves are deﬁned as the ratio of instantaneous width change 
to instantaneous thickness change.  That is, assume  that the width W and 
thickness T are measured as function of strain.  Th en the corresponding R-
value is given by: 
|u1D44J =|u1D4J1 /u1D44A 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ //u1D44A
|u1D4J1|u1D447 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ /|u1D447 
4.  The anisotropic yield criterion Φ for plane stress is deﬁned as: 
Φ= |u1D43∆|oneCst|u1D4JACst+ |u1D43∆|threeCst|u1D43∆|twoCst(|u1D4JACst/|twoCst)−|oneCst+/u1D450|u1D4JACst|u1D43∆|fourCst|u1D4JACst/|twoCst= |parenleftCv11 +/u1D450|u1D4JACst− 2|u1D44∆ + |u1D44F|parenriµhtCv1|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st|u1D4JACst 
where |u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st is the yield stress and K i = 1,4  are given by: 
|u1D43∆|oneCst=|dividesCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|dividesCv2 
|u1D43∆|twoCst=|dividesCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst|twoCst+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst+ 2|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst|u1D466Cst |twoCst|dividesCv2 
|u1D43∆|threeCst= −2|u1D44∆|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst|twoCst− |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D44F|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst− |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenriµhtCv2|twoCst

If FLAG = 0, the anisotropic material constants a, b, and c are obtained through 
R00 , R 45 , and R 90  using these 3 equations: 
1 + 2|u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst =/u1D450|u1D4JACst− |u1D44∆ +{(|u1D4JA + 2)/2|u1D4JA}|u1D44F
1 − |u1D44∆ +{(|u1D4JA − 2)/2|u1D4JA}|u1D44F 
1 + 2|u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst =/u1D450|u1D4JACst *.   
 To include strain rate eﬀects in the model we multi ply the yield stress by a 
factor depending on the eﬀective plastic strain rat e.  We use the Cowper-
Symonds’ model, hence the yield stress can be writt en 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D7≠∆/Y.st|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst)
⎣⎢⎡1 + |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst
|u1D436|parenriµhtCv6|oneCst/|u1D4JDCst
⎦⎥⎤ 
where |u1D7≠∆/Y.st|u1D46≠Cst denotes the static yield stress, |u1D436 and |u1D4JD are material parameters, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst is 
the eﬀective plastic strain rate. 
5.  A kinematic hardening model is implemented followi ng the works of 
Chaboche and Roussilier.  A back stress α is introduced such that the eﬀective 
stress is computed as 
|u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st= |u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst − 2|u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst , |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst − 2|u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst , |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|twoCst ) 
The back stress is the sum of up to four terms acco rding to 
|u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J8Cst|fourCst
|u1D4J8Cst=|oneCst 
and the evolution of each back stress component is as follows 
|u1D6FF|u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J8Cst= |u1D436|u1D4J8Cst|parenleftCvJ|u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst 
|u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st− |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J8Cst|parenriµhtCvJ |u1D6FF|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst 
where |u1D436|u1D4J8Cst and |u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst are material parameters, |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  is the deviatoric stress tensor, |u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st is 
the eﬀective stress and |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain. *
