Remarks: 
This is an orthotropic material with optional delam ination failure for brittle composites.  
The elastic formulation is identical to the DYNA3D model that uses total strain 
formulation.  The constitutive matrix C that relates to global components of stress to the  
global components of strain is deﬁned as: 
C = T|u1D447CstC|u1D43FCstT 
where T is the transformation matrix between the local mat erial coordinate system and 
the global system and C|u1D43FCstis the constitutive matrix deﬁned in terms of the m aterial 
constants of the local orthogonal material axes |u1D44∆, |u1D44F, and /u1D450 (see DYNA3D use manual). 
 
Failure is described using linear softening stress strain curves for the interlaminar 
normal and interlaminar shear directions.  The curr ent implementation for failure is 
essentially two-dimensional.  Damage can occur in t he interlaminar normal direction 
and a single interlaminar shear direction.  The ori entation of these directions with 
respect to the principal material directions must b e speciﬁed by the user. 
 
Based on speciﬁed values for the ultimate stress an d the critical energy release rate 
bounding surfaces are deﬁned as 
|u1D4J3|u1D4JBCst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst− |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D4JBCst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JBCst) 
|u1D4J3|u1D46≠Cst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst− |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D46≠Cst) 
where the subscripts |u1D4JB and |u1D46≠ refer to the normal and shear component.  If stres ses 
exceed the bounding surfaces, inelastic straining o ccurs.  The ultimate strain is obtained 
by relating the crack growth energy and the dissipa ted energy.  For solid elements with 
a single integration point it can be derived to obt ain
