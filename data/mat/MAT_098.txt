  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
PSFAIL Eﬀective plastic strain at failure.  If zero , failure is not considered.  
SIGMAX Maximum stress obtainable from work hardening befor e rate 
eﬀects are added (optional).  This option is ignore d if VP = 1.0 
SIGSAT Saturation stress which limits the maximum value of  eﬀective 
stress which can develop after rate eﬀects are adde d (optional). 
EPS0 Quasi-static threshold strain rate.  See descr iption under *. . 
B See Remark 1  in *. . 
C See Remark 1  in *
