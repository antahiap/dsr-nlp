) to model metal sheets und er cyclic plasticity loading with 
anisotropy in plane stress condition.  Lankford par ameters are used for the deﬁnition of 
the anisotropy.  Yoshida’s theory describes the har dening rule with a “two surfaces” 
method: the yield surface and the bounding surface.   In the forming process, the yield 
surface does not change in size, but its center mov es with deformation; the bounding 
surface changes both in size and location.

NLP 
The NLP option estimates necking failure using the Formability Index (F.I.), which 
accounts for the non-linear strain paths seen in me tal forming applications (see Remark 
4).  When using this option, specify IFLD in Card 3.   Since the NLP option also works 
with a linear strain path, it is recommended to be used as the default failure criterion in 
metal forming.  The NLP option is also available fo r *
