This is Material Type 172.  This model is available  for shell and Hughes-Liu beam 
elements only.  The material model can represent pl ain concrete only, reinforcing steel 
only, or a smeared combination of concrete and rein forcement.  The model includes 
concrete cracking in tension and crushing in compre ssion as well as reinforcement 
yield, hardening, and failure.  Properties are ther mally sensitive; the material model can 
be used for ﬁre analysis.  Material data and equati ons governing the behavior 
(including thermal properties) are taken from Euroc ode 2 (EC2).  See the remarks below 
for more details on how the standard is applied in the material model.  
 
Although the material model oﬀers many options, a r easonable response may be 
obtained by entering only RO, FC, and FT for plain concrete.  If reinforcement is 
present, YMREINF, SUREINF, FRACRX, FRACRY must be d eﬁned, or for an alternative 
way to model the reinforcement, see *.

 Remarks: 
1.  Material Types.   This material model can be used to represent unre inforced 
concrete (FRACR = 0.0 where FRACR = max (FRACX, FRAC Y )), reinforcing 
steel (FRACR = 1.0), or a smeared combination of re inforced concrete with 
evenly distributed reinforcement (0.0 < FRACR < 1.0 ).  Concrete is modelled as 
an initially-isotropic material with a non-rotating  smeared crack approach in 
tension, together with a plasticity model for compr essive loading.  Reinforce- 
ment is treated as separate sets of bars in the loc al material |u1D46J and |u1D466 axes.  The 
reinforcement is assumed not to carry through-thick ness shear or in-plane 
shear.  Therefore, this material model should not b e used to model steel-only 
sections, that is, do not create a section in which  all the integration points are of 
*.  with FRACRX and/or FRA CRY = 1.0. 
The material ID of each integration point is then s et to represent either concrete 
or steel.  The position of each integration point w ithin the cross-section and its 
cross-sectional area are chosen to represent the ac tual distribution of rein- 
forcement.  If desired, *.   *.   
 list of extra history variables in Remark 8 ). Furthermore, we assume that 
the shear reinforcement will prevent any inelastic through-thickness shear 
deformation.  Thus, through-thickness slipping on c rack planes is auto- 
matically disabled. 
b)  TYPESC > 10 represents the situation where no shea r reinforcement is 
provided.  A brittle failure occurs if the shear ca pacity is exceeded.  Note, 
however, that the shear capacity is calculated from  equations in design 
codes and may be quite conservative. 
c)  If TYPESC = 1 or 11, the shear capacity calculatio n is based on BS 8110-
1:1997. You should supply the percentage reinforcem ent (P_OR_F), eﬀec- 
tive depth of section EFFD (this typically excludes  the cover concrete), and 
load factor GAMSC. These are used in Table 3.8 of B S 8110-1:1997 to de- 
termine the design shear stress.  The “shear capaci ty” is this design shear 
stress times the total section thickness (force per  unit width), modiﬁed ac- 
cording to Equation 6b of BS 8110 to allow for axia l load.  
d)  If TYPESC = 2 or 12, the shear capacity calculatio n is based on ACI 318-
05M. The shear capacity, ∅|u1D449|u1D4JBCst, is calculated assuming ∅= 0.75  and taking 
|u1D449|u1D4JBCst from ACI 318-05M equations 11-4 (for compressive a xial load) or 11-8 
(for tensile axial load).  In these equations, |u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst is taken as P_OR_F × FC, the 
term |u1D4J1 is taken as EFFD, and the term |u1D44F|u1D464Cst is taken as 1 to give shear capaci- 
ty as a force per unit width.  Note that in LS-DYNA  versions prior to R13, 
Equation 11-4 was incorrectly implemented, so resul ts from the TYPE-
SC = 2 check prior to R13 should not be used. 
For all of the above options, the “shear demand” (a ctual shear force per unit 
width) is compared to the shear capacity.  This pro cess is performed separately 
for each of the two local directions of the reinfor cement in each element.  When 
deﬁning sections using *PART_COMPOSITE or integrati on rules with multiple 
sets of material properties, it is important that e ach set of material properties 
referenced has the same local material axes (see Remark 4 ). The shear demand 
and axial load (used in calculation of the shear ca pacity) are summed across 
the integration points within the section.  The ext ra history variables for capaci- 
ty, demand, and diﬀerence between capacity and dema nd relate to the whole 
section (not to each integration point separately).   Thus, the same values are 
written to all the integration points within an ele ment. 
6.  Thermal Expansion.   By default, thermal expansion properties from EC2  are 
used.  If no temperatures are deﬁned in the model, properties for 20℃ are 
used.  For TYPEC = 3, 6 or 9, and TYPER = 5, there is no thermal expansion by 
default, and the properties do not vary with temper ature.  The user may over- 
ride the default thermal expansion behaviour by deﬁ ning curves of thermal *.

tively. 
Note that the concrete stress history variables are  stored in element local axes 
irrespective of AOPT, that is, local |u1D46J is always the direction from node 1 to 
node 2. The reinforcement stresses are in the reinf orcement directions; these do 
take account of AOPT. 
Material Behavior of Concrete: 
Thermal sensitivity 
 
For TYPEC = 1,2,4,5,7,8, the material properties ar e thermally-sensitive.  If no 
temperatures are deﬁned in the model, it behaves as  if at 20℃. Pre-programmed 
relationships between temperature and concrete prop erties are taken from the EC2 
document.  The thermal expansion coeﬃcient is as de ﬁned in EC2, is non-zero by 
default, and is a function of temperature.  This co eﬃcient may be overridden by 
inputting the curve LCALPC. TYPEC = 3, 6 and 9 are not thermally sensitive and have 
no thermal expansion coeﬃcient by default. 
 *.   
 LCHAR can optionally be used to maintain constant e nergy per unit area of crack 
irrespective of mesh size, that is, the crack openi ng displacement is ﬁxed rather than the 
crack opening strain.  LCHAR × ECUTEN is then the displacement to fully open a 
crack.  For the actual elements, crack opening disp lacement is estimated by strain ×
/radical.v1area .  Note that if LCHAR is deﬁned, it is also used as  the crack spacing in the NS 3473 
aggregate interlock calculation. 
 
For the thermally-sensitive values of TYPEC, the re lationship of FT with temperature is 
taken from EC2 – there is no input option to change  this.  FT is assumed to remain at its 
input value at temperatures up to 100°C, then to re duce linearly with temperature to 
zero at 600°C. Up to 500°C, the crack opening strai n ECUTEN increases with 
temperature such that the fracture energy to open t he crack remains constant.  Above 
500℃ the crack opening strain does not increase fur ther. 
 
In some concrete design codes and standards, it is stipulated that the tensile strength of 
concrete should be assumed to be zero.  However, fo r .   *.   
 |u1D7≠≠csp = |u1D7≠≠cu + 2FCC 
E 
Note that for unconﬁned concrete, FCC = FC causing |u1D7≠≠c1  to default to 0.002.  To over-
ride the default values |u1D7≠≠c1 , |u1D7≠≠cu , and |u1D7≠≠csp , set EC1_6, ECUT36, and ECSP69, respectively.  
 
Compressive response: TYPEC = 9 
 
For TYPEC = 9, the input parameter FC is the charac teristic cylinder strength in the 
stress units of the model.  FC × UNITC is assumed t o be f ck , the strength class in MPa 
units.  The mean tensile strength f ctm , mean Young’s modulus E cm , and the strains used 
to construct the stress-strain curve such as |u1D7≠≠c1  are by default evaluated automatically 
from tabulated functions of f ck  given in Table 3.1 of EC2. The compressive strengt h of 
the material is given by the input parameter FCC, w hich defaults to the mean 
compressive strength f cm  deﬁned in EC2 as f ck  + 8MPa.  The user may override the 
default compressive strength by inputting FCC expli citly.  The stress-strain curve 
follows this form: 
Stress 
FCC =  /u1D458|u1D7≠2 − |u1D7≠2|twoCst
1 + (/u1D458− 2)|u1D7≠2  , 
where FCC is the input parameter FCC (default: = (f ck  + 8MPa)/UNITC), |u1D7≠2 = strain/|u1D7≠≠c1, 
/u1D458= 1.05|u1D438 × |u1D7≠≠c1 FCC ⁄ , and |u1D438 is the Young’s modulus.

Shear Strength on Cracking Planes: 
Before cracking, the through-thickness shear stress  in the concrete is unlimited., unless 
TYPESC > 10 (see Remark 5 ) For cracked elements, shear stress on the crack p lane 
(magnitude of shear stress including element-plane and through-thickness terms) is 
treated in one of two ways: 
1.  If AGGSZ > 0.0, the relationship from Norwegian st andard NS3473 is used to 
model the aggregate-interlock that allows cracked c oncrete to carry shear load- 
ing.  The maximum shear stress that can be carried on the crack plane, /u1D̅0F|u1D4JACst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D46JCst , 
depends on compressive stress on the crack |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst(if the crack is closed) or on 
crack opening width |u1D464 (if the crack is open):  
/u1D̅0Fmax = 0.1 8/u1D̅0Frm + 1.64|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst− 0.82 |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst|twoCst
/u1D̅0Frm  
/u1D̅0Frm =  2FTS H R 
0.31 + 24|u1D464
(D|zeroCst+ 16) 
FTSHR is deﬁned on Card 9 and defaults to FT on Car d 1.  
UNITL is compulsory when AGGSZ is non-zero. This is  the factor that con- 
verts model length units to millimeters, that is, t he aggregate size in millime- 
tres D|zeroCst= AGGS Z  ×U NITL .  
The crack width is estimated from |u1D464 =U NITL × |u1D7≠≠cro ×/u1D4:F|u1D4J2Cst, where |u1D7≠≠cro  is the 
crack opening strain and /u1D4:F|u1D4J2Cst is the crack spacing.  /u1D4:F|u1D4J2Cst is taken as LCHAR if non-
zero or is equal to element size if LCHAR is zero.  
Optionally, TAUMXC may be used to set the maximum s hear stress when the 
crack is closed and the normal stress is zero – by default this works out as 
1.161 × FT from the above equations.  If TAUMXC is deﬁned, the shear stress 
from the NS3473 formula, /u1D̅0Fmax , is scaled by TAUMXC / 1.161 × FT. 
2.  If AGGSZ = 0.0, the aggregate interlock is modeled  by this formula: 
/u1D̅0Fmax =TA U MXC 
1.0 +|u1D7≠≠cro 
ECRAGG + min|parenleftCv2M U × |u1D7≠∆comp ,TA U MXF|parenriµhtCv2  , 
where /u1D̅0Fmax  is the maximum shear stress carried across a crack ; |u1D7≠∆comp is the 
compressive stress across the crack (this is zero i f the crack is open); and EC- *. . When using 
beam elements, ELFORM = 1 is required.
