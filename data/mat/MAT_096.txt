 The evolution of |u1D6F+ is governed by a maximum dissipation argument.  Wh en 
the normalized value reaches unity, the material's strength has been reduced to 
2% of its original value in the normal and parallel  directions to the smeared 
crack.  Note that for plotting purposes it is never  output greater than 5. 
4.  |u1D4J3|u1D46≠Cst is the initial shear traction that may be transmit ted across a smeared crack 
plane.  The shear traction is limited to be less th an or equal to |u1D4J3|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv11 − |u1D6FD|parenriµhtCv1|parenleftCv11 −
exp[−/u1D4:B |u1D6F+]|parenriµhtCv1 through the use of two orthogonal shear damage sur faces.  Note 
that the shear degradation is coupled to the tensil e degradation through the 
internal variable |u1D6F+ which measures the intensity of the crack ﬁeld. |u1D6FD is the 
shear retention factor deﬁned below.  The shear deg radation is taken care of by 
reducing the material's shear stiﬀness parallel to the smeared crack plane. 
5.  |u1D4J4|u1D4J≠Cst is the fracture toughness of the material.  It sho uld be entered as fracture 
energy per unit area crack advance.  Once entered t he softening modulus is 
automatically calculated based on element and crack  geometries.  
6.  |u1D6FD is the shear retention factor.  As the damage prog resses the shear tractions 
allowed across the smeared crack plane asymptote to  the product |u1D6FD|u1D4J3|u1D46≠Cst. 
7.  |u1D7≠2 represents the viscosity of the material.  Viscous  behavior is implemented as 
a simple Perzyna regularization method which allows  for the inclusion of ﬁrst 
order rate eﬀects.  The use of some viscosity is re commend as it serves as regu- 
larizing parameter that increases the stability of calculations. 
8.  |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst is a uniaxial compressive yield stress.  A check o n compressive stresses is 
made using the J2 yield function  
/u1D42C:/u1D42C−/radical.v52
3|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst≤ 0  , 
where /u1D42C is the stress deviator.  If violated, a J2 return mapping correction is 
executed.  This check is executed (1) when no damag e has taken place at an 
integration point yet; (2) when damage has taken pl ace at a point, but the crack 
is currently closed; and (3) during active damage a fter the damage integration 
(i.e. as an operator split).  Note that if the crac k is open the plasticity correction 
is done in the plane-stress subspace of the crack p lane. 
 
A variety of experimental data has been replicated using this model from quasi-static to 
explosive situations.  Reasonable properties for a standard grade concrete would be:
