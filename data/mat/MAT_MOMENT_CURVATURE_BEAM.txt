This is Material Type 166.  This material is for pe rforming nonlinear elastic or multi-
linear plastic analysis of Belytschko-Schwer beams with user-deﬁned axial force-strain, 
moment curvature and torque-twist rate curves.  If strain, curvature or twist rate is 
located outside the curves, use extrapolation to de termine the corresponding rigidity.  
For multi-linear plastic analysis, the user-deﬁned curves are used as yield surfaces.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
E Young’s modulus.  This variable controls the time s tep size and 
must be chosen carefully.  Increasing the value of E will decrease 
the time step size. 
ELAF Load curve ID for the axial force-strain curve  *.   
 Remarks: 
For symmetric curves (see ﬁelds CTA, CTB, and CTT a bove), all data points must be in 
the ﬁrst quadrant, and at least three data points n eed to be given, starting from the 
origin, followed by the yield point.   
 
For asymmetric curves, at least ﬁve data points are  needed and exactly one point must 
be at the origin.  The two points on both sides of the origin record the positive and 
negative yield points. 
 
The last data point(s) has no physical meaning: it serves only as a control point for inter 
or extrapolation. 
 
The curves are input by the user and treated in LS- DYNA as linearly piecewise 
functions.  The curves must be monotonically increa sing while the slopes must be 
monotonically decreasing. *
