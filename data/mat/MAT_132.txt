  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
element nodes as shown in Figure M2-1 .  Nodes 1, 2, 
and 4 of an element are identical to the nodes used for 
the deﬁnition of a coordinate system as by *DEFINE_ -
COORDINATE_NODES. 
EQ.1.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y a 
point in space and the global location of the eleme nt 
center; this is the |u1D44∆-direction.  This option is for solid 
elements only. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR. 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector /u1D42F with the 
element normal.  The plane of a solid ele ment is the 
midsurface between the inner surface and outer surf ace 
deﬁned by the ﬁrst four nodes and the last four nod es 
of the connectivity of the element, respectively. 
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D443, which deﬁne the centerline ax- 
is.  This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR).   
XP YP ZP Deﬁne coordinates of point |u1D443 for AOPT = 1 and 4. 
A1 A2 A3 Deﬁne components of vector /u1D482 for AOPT = 2. 
MACF Material axes change ﬂag for brick elements: 
EQ.1: No change (default) 
EQ.2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F. 
EQ.3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450. 
EQ.4: Switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450. 
V1 V2 V3 Deﬁne components of vector /u1D42F for AOPT = 3 and 4. *.   
 with |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst as the critical energy release rate, |u1D449 as the element volume, |u1D434 as the area 
perpendicular to the active normal direction and |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st ult  as the ultimate stress.  For the 
normal component failure can only occur under tensi le loading.  For the shear 
component the behavior is symmetric around zero.  T he resulting stress bounds are 
depicted in Figure M132-1 .  Unloading is modeled with a Secant stiﬀness.
