This is  Material Type 126.  This material model is usually used for aluminum 
honeycomb crushable foam materials with anisotropic  behavior.  Three yield surfaces 
are available.  The ﬁrst yield surface deﬁnes the n onlinear elastoplastic material 
behavior separately for all normal and shear stress es, which are considered to be fully 
uncoupled.  The second yield surface considers the eﬀects of oﬀ-axis loading.  It is 
transversely isotropic.  However, because of this d eﬁnition of the second yield surface, 
the material can collapse in a shear mode due to lo w shear resistance.  There was no 
obvious way of increasing the shear resistance with out changing the behavior in purely 
uniaxial compression.  Therefore, with the third yi eld surface, the model has been 
modiﬁed so that the shear and hydrostatic resistanc e can be prescribed for the material 
without aﬀecting the uniaxial behavior.  The choice  of the second yield surface is 
ﬂagged by the sign of the ﬁrst load curve ID, LCA.  The third yield surface is ﬂagged by 
the sign of ECCU, which becomes the initial stress yield limit in simple shear.  A 
description is given below. 
 
The development of the second and third yield surfa ces are based on experimental test 
results of aluminum honeycomb specimens at Toyota M otor Corporation. 
 
The default element for this material is solid type  0, a nonlinear spring type brick 
element.  The recommended hourglass control is the type 2 viscous formulation for one 
point integrated solid elements.  The stiﬀness form  of the hourglass control when used 
with this constitutive model can lead to nonphysica l results since strain localization in 
the shear modes can be inhibited.

LCS Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_CURVE): 
LCA.LT.0: Damage curve giving the shear stress multiplier as 
a function of the shear strain component.  This 
curve deﬁnition is optional and may be used if 
damage is desired.  IF SHDFLG = 0 (the default), 
the damage value multiplies the stress every time 
step and the stress is updated incrementally.  The 
damage curve should be set to unity until failure 
begins.  Afte r failure the value should drop to 0.999 
or 0.99 or any number between zero and one de- 
pending on how many steps are needed to zero the 
stress.  Alternatively, if SHDFLG = 1, the damage 
value is treated as a factor that scales the shear 
stress compared to the undamaged value. 
LCA.GT.0: Shear stress as a function of shear strain.  For th e 
corotational solid elements, types 0 and 9, enginee r- 
ing strain is expected, but for all other solid and

Remarks: 
1.  Load Curves and Efﬁciency.   For eﬃciency it is strongly recommended that 
the load curve IDs: LCA, LCB, LCC, LCS, LCAB, LCBC,  and LCCA, contain 
exactly the same number of points with correspondin g strain values on the 
abscissa.  If this recommendation is followed, the cost of the table lookup is 
insigniﬁcant.  Conversely, the cost increases signi ﬁcantly if the abscissa strain 
values are not consistent between load curves. 
2.  Elastic Moduli.  For solid element formulations 1 and 2, and thick s hell 
formulations 3, 5, and 7, the behavior before compa ction is orthotropic where 
the components of the stress tensor are uncoupled, meaning a component of 
strain will generate resistance in the local |u1D44∆-direction with no coupling to the 
local |u1D44F and /u1D450 directions.  The elastic moduli vary from their in itial values to the 
fully compacted values linearly with the relative v olume: 
|u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst =|u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D462Cst +|u1D6FD(|u1D438−|u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D462Cst )

If LCA > 0, each component of the updated stress te nsor is checked to ensure 
that it does not exceed the permissible value deter mined from the load curves;

the aa stress component, 41-50 for the bb  component, 51-60 for the cc compo- 
nent, and 61-70 for the ab, bc, cb  shear stress components.  The parameter |u1D7≠6 is 
either unity or a value taken from the load curve n umber, LCSR, that deﬁnes |u1D7≠6 
as a function of strain-rate.  Strain-rate is deﬁne d here as the Euclidean norm of 
the deviatoric strain-rate tensor. 
If LCA < 0, a transversely isotropic yield surface is obtained where the uniaxial 
limit stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2/u1Dℜ11, |u1D7≠≠v ol |parenriµhtCv2, can be deﬁned as a function of angle /u1Dℜ11 with the strong 
axis and volumetric strain, |u1D7≠≠v ol .  In order to facilitate the input of data to such  a 
limit stress surface, the limit stress is written a s: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2/u1Dℜ11, |u1D7≠≠v ol |parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|parenleftCv1/u1Dℜ11|parenriµhtCv1 + |parenleftCv1cos /u1Dℜ11|parenriµhtCv1|twoCst|u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠v ol |parenriµhtCv2 + |parenleftCv1sin /u1Dℜ11|parenriµhtCv1|twoCst|u1D7≠∆|u1D464Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠v ol |parenriµhtCv2 
where the functions |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst, and |u1D7≠∆|u1D464Cst are represented by load curves LCA, LCB, 
LCC, respectively.  The latter two curves can be us ed to include the stiﬀening 
eﬀects that are observed as the foam material crush es to the point where it 
begins to lock up.  To ensure that the limit stress  decreases with respect to the 
oﬀ-angle the curves should be deﬁned such that foll owing equations hold: 
∂|u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|parenleftCv1/u1Dℜ11|parenriµhtCv1
∂/u1Dℜ11≤ 0 
and  
|u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠v ol |parenriµhtCv2 − |u1D7≠∆|u1D464Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠v ol |parenriµhtCv2 ≥ 0. 
A drawback of this implementation was that the mate rial often collapsed in 
shear mode due to low shear resistance.  There was no way of increasing the 
shear resistance without changing the behavior in p ure uniaxial compression.  
We have therefore modiﬁed the model so that the use r can optionally prescribe 
the shear and hydrostatic resistance in the materia l without aﬀecting the uniax- *.   
 We can now update the pressure using the elastic bu lk modulus, |u1D43∆ 
|u1D4JD|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D4JD|u1D4JBCst− |u1D43∆∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2
|u1D43∆ =|u1D438
3(1 − 2/u1D̅08) 
and obtain the ﬁnal value for the Cauchy stress 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst− |u1D4JD|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
After completing the stress update, we transform th e stresses back to the global 
conﬁguration.
