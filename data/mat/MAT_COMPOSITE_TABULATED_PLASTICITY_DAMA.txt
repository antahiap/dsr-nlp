  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
EQ.1.0:  Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y a 
point, |u1D443, in space and the global location of the element 
center.  This option is for solid elements only. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by a 
vector /u1D42F and the normal vector to the plane of the ele- 
ment.  The plane of a solid element is the midsurfa ce 
between the inner surface and outer surface deﬁned by 
the ﬁrst four nodes and the last four nodes of the con- 
nectivity of the element, respectively.  Th us, for solid 
elements, AOPT = 3 is only available for hexahedrons. 
/u1D41A is determined by taking the cross product of /u1D42F with 
the normal vector, /u1D41B is determined by taking the cross 
product of the normal vector with /u1D41A, and /u1D41C is the nor- 
mal vector.  Then /u1D41A and /u1D41B are rotated about /u1D41C by an an- 
gle BETA. BE TA may be set in the keyword input for 
the element or in the input for this keyword.  Note  that 
for solids, the material axes may be switched depen d- 
ing on the choice of MACF. The switch may occur be-
fore or after applying BE TA depending on the value of 
MACF. 
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector, /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D443, deﬁning the centerline axis.  
This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE-_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR). 
MACF Material axes change ﬂag for solid elements: 
EQ.-4: Switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450 before BETA rotation 
EQ.-3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450 before BETA rotation 
EQ.-2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F before BETA rotation  
EQ.1: No change, default 
EQ.2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F after BETA rotation 
EQ.3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450 after BETA rotation *. GE

TCSYM Flag for handling tension- compression asymmetry in all three 
material directions: 
EQ.0:  Do not adjust user-deﬁned data. 
EQ.1: Compute and use average of tension and compression 
elastic moduli in adjusting the stress- strain curve.  See 
Remark 7 . 
EQ.2: Use compression modulus as user- deﬁned tension 
modulus in adjusting the stress-strain curve.  See Remark 
7. 
EQ.3: Use tension modulus as user- deﬁned compression 
modulus in adjusting the stress-strain curve.  See Remark 
7. 
EQ.4: Use user- deﬁned tensile curve as the compressive curve 
overriding the user- deﬁned compressive curve.  This 
implies that the normal stress-strain curves are sy mmet- 
ric including yield values. 
EQ.5: Use user- deﬁned compressive curve as the tensile curve 
overriding the user- deﬁned tensile curve.  This implies 
that the normal stress-strain curves are symmetric in- 
cluding yield values.

A typical damage curve has the total strain in the loading direction as abscissa 
values with the corresponding damage value given as  the ordinate values as 
shown below.  The ﬁnal strain value in the curve mu st correspond to the ﬁnal 
strain in the corresponding QS-RT input stress-stra in curve.

6.  Element Erosion.   Element is eroded if failure occurs at any one Ga uss point.  
Note that *DEFINE_ELEMENT_EROSION_SHELL is required  for shell ele- 
ment erosion; the number of integration points need ed to fail to erode the ele- 
ment is deﬁned there. 
7.  Adjusting Stress-Strain Curves.   The user-deﬁned stress-strain curves are 
adjusted when using TCSYM = 1, 2, and 3 as follows.   If |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst|zeroCsts  and |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st|zeroCsts represent 
the original |u1D44∆-direction (1-direction) elastic tensile and compre ssive moduli 
respectively, then the modiﬁed elastic moduli are c omputed as 
a)  TCSYM = 1.   |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst=  |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st= 0.5 |parenleftCv3|u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst|zeroCsts+ |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st|zeroCsts|parenriµhtCv3   
b)  TCSYM = 2.   |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst= |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst|zeroCsts and |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st= |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst|zeroCsts 
c)  TCSYM = 3.  |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst= |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st|zeroCsts and |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st= |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st|zeroCsts.  
Let |u1D44J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst= |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst|u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst|zeroCsts/fraction.v1  and |u1D44J|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st= |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st|u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st|zeroCsts/fraction.v1 .  The adjusted tensile strain is then com- 
puted as the original tensile strain divided by |u1D44J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst, the adjusted compressive 
strain is computed as the original compressive stra in divided by |u1D44J|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st, the ad- 
justed tensile yield strain is computed as the orig inal tensile yield strain divid- 
ed by |u1D44J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst, and the adjusted compressive yield strain is comp uted as the original 
compressive yield strain divided by |u1D44J|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st.  The same process is then applied to 
the other two normal directions. 
8.  Curve Discretization.  For this material, only LCINT on *CONTROL_SOLU-
TION (not with *DEFINE_CURVE) can be used to specif y the number of dis- 
cretized points for the input curves.  The default value is 100. *. GE
