  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label n ot exceeding 8 
characters must be speciﬁed. 
RO Mass density 
PC Pressure cutoﬀ (≤ 0.0) 
MULO Dynamic viscosity: 
GE.0.0:  if MUHI = 0.0 or is not deﬁned, then this is the 
traditional constant dynamic viscosity coeﬃcient, |u1D7≠7.  
Otherwise if MUHI  >  0.0, then MU LO and MUHI are 
the lower and upper dynamic viscosity limit values.    
LT.0.0:  -MULO is a load curve ID deﬁning dynamic viscosity 
as a function of equivalent strain rate. 
MUHI Upper dynamic viscosity limit (default = 0.0) if MULO > 0.  This 
is deﬁned only if RK and RN are deﬁned for the vari able viscosity 
case. 
RK Variable dynamic viscosity multiplier (see Remark 6  of .   *
