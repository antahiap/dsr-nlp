5.  Nonlinear Strain Paths.   When the keyword option NLP_FAILURE is used, a 
necking failure criterion independent of strain pat h changes is activated.  In 
sheet metal forming, as strain path history (plotte d on in-plane major and mi- 
nor strain space) of an element becomes non-linear,  the position and shape of a 
traditional strain-based Forming Limit Diagram (FLD ) changes.  This option 
provides a simple formability index (F.I.) which re mains invariant regardless 
of the presence of the non-linear strain paths in t he model and can be used to 
identify if the element has reached its necking lim it. Equivalent strain

RBAR Plastic anisotropic parameter |u1D4JF̅ (Lankford coeﬃcient), also 
commonly referred to as “r- bar value” in sheet metal forming 
literature.  For shell elements, |u1D4JF̅= |u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst = |u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst = |u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst  is assumed in 
the plane of the shell. 
HLCID Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_CURVE) g iving true strain as a 
function true stress.  This curve is used in conjun ction with OPT 
below and should not be referenced or used in other  keywords. 
Using this parameter is not recommended.  
OPT Error calculation ﬂag.   The default value of “0” is recommended.  
EQ.2:  LS-DYNA will perform error calculation based on the 
true stress- strain curve from uniaxial tension, speciﬁed 
by HLCID.  The corrections will be made to the cycl ic 
load curve, both in the loading and unloading porti ons.  
Since, in some c ases where loading is more complex, the 
accumulated plastic strain could be large (say more  than 
30%), the input uniaxial stress- strain curve must have 
enough strain range to cover the maximum expected 
plastic strain.  Note this variable must be set to a v alue of 
“2” if HLCID is speciﬁed and a stress- strain curve is 
used.  
CB The uppercase |u1D43J deﬁned in Yoshida & Uemori’s equations. *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
C1, C2 Constants used to modify |u1D44J̇, so strain hardening will not saturate:  
|u1D44J̇= RSAT × |<racketleftCv1(|u1D436|oneCst+ |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst)|u1D4J≠Cst|twoCsts− |u1D436|oneCst|u1D4J≠Cst|twoCsts|<racketriµhtCv1 
Note these variables are not the material parameter  /u1D450 that controls 
the rate of the kinematic hardening in the original  Yoshida & 
Uemori paper. 
IFLD ID of a load curve deﬁning Forming Limit Diagram (F LD) under 
linear strain paths.  In the load curve, abscissas represent minor 
strains while ordinates represent major strains.  D eﬁne only when 
the option NLP is used.   
The Yoshida & Uemori Kinematic Hardening Model: 
The two-surface model from Yoshida and Uemori is in dicated by the following 
equations where the variable descriptions are indic ated in Figure M125-1  [2]: 
|u1D6F+∗= |u1D6F+ − |u1D6FD
|u1D6F+∗=/u1D450|<racketleftCv6|parenleftCv4|u1D44∆
/u1D44C|parenriµhtCv4 (|u1D7≠∆ − |u1D6F+) −/radical.v5|u1D44∆
|u1D6F+∗|u1D6F+∗|<racketriµhtCv6 |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst
|u1D44∆ = |u1D43J + |u1D44J −/u1D44C 
The anisotropic hardening parameter, |u1D44J̇, depends on the value of IOPT.  The original 
Yoshida and Uemori model includes saturation in str ain hardening (IOPT = 0) [ 1, 2] and 
was modiﬁed to include continuous hardening (IOPT =  1).  The change in the parameter 
is as follows: 
|u1D44J̇=/u1D458(|u1D44Jsat − |u1D44J)|u1D7≠≠̅̇|u1D4JDCst           if IOPT = 0
|u1D44J̇= |u1D44Jsat × |<racketleftCv1|parenleftCv1|u1D436|oneCst+ |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D4J≠Cst|twoCsts− |u1D436|oneCst|u1D4J≠Cst|twoCsts|<racketriµhtCv1      if IOPT = 1 
The change of size and location for the bounding su rface is deﬁned as follows, with 
variable descriptions shown in Figure M125-2 ,
