: *.  
*.   *.  part can be  discretized into multiple dis joint pieces and have each piece 
behave as an independent rigid body.  The inertia p roperties for the disjoint pieces are 
determined directly from the ﬁnite element discreti zation.   
Nodes of a *.  part 
may share nodes with deformable structural and soli d elements.   
This material option can be used to model granular material where the grains interact 
through an automatic single surface contact deﬁniti on.  Another possible use includes 
modeling bolts as rigid bodies where the bolts belo ng to the same part ID.  This model 
eliminates the need to represent each rigid piece w ith a unique part ID.
