To obtain the pre- R10 behavior, that is, a maximum of 2 cracks, 
add 100 to TYPEC. For example, 109 means 2 cracks, EC2 1- 1:2004 
(general and buildings). 
UNITC Factor to convert stress units to MPa (used in shea r capacity 
checks and for application of EC2 formulae when TYP EC = 9).  
For example, if the model units are New tons and meters, 
UNITC = 10 -6. 
ECUTEN Strain to fully open a crack 
FCC Relevant only if TYPEC = 6 or 9. 
TYPEC.EQ.6: FCC is the compressive strength of conﬁned 
concrete used in Mander equations.  Default: un- 
conﬁned properties are assumed (FCC = FC). 
TYPEC.EQ.9: FCC is the actual compressive strength.  If blank, 
this will be set equal to the mean compressive 
strength (f cm  in EC2 1-1) as required for servicea- 
bility calculations (8MPa greater than FC).  For 
ultimate load calculations the user may set FCC 
to a factored characteristic compressive strength.

2.  Creating Reinforced Concrete Sections.   Reinforced concrete sections for 
shell or beam elements may be created using *PART_C OMPOSITE (for shells) 
or *INTEGRATION_BEAM (for beams) to deﬁne the secti on.  Create one mate- 
rial deﬁnition to represent the concrete using *MAT _CONCRETE_EC2 with 
FRACR = 0.0. Create another material deﬁnition repr esenting the reinforce- 
ment using *.   
 bility is required with the structural engineering data and assumptions of Part 
1-1 of the Eurocode. 
A further option for modelling concrete, TYPEC = 6,  is provided for applica- 
tions, such as seismic engineering, in which the di ﬀerent stress-strain behaviors 
of conﬁned versus unconﬁned concrete needs to be ca ptured.  This option uses 
equations by Mander et al and does not relate direc tly to Eurocode 2.  
4.  Local Material Axes.   The local material axes deﬁne the directions of t he 
reinforcement bars.  If the reinforcement direction s are not consistent across 
neighbouring elements, the response may be less sti ﬀ than intended – this is 
equivalent to the bars being bent at the element bo undaries.  Local material 
axes default to the same as the element axes, with the local |u1D46J direction pointing 
from Node 1 to Node 2. The local material axes can be controlled using the 
angle BETA on *ELEMENT_SHELL_BETA or using AOPT and  associated in- 
put parameters in the material deﬁnition.  See mate rial type 2 for a description 
of the diﬀerent AOPT settings.  
Only the reinforcement response depends on the loca l material axes, not the 
concrete response.  Therefore, it is not usually ne cessary to set the local materi- 
al axes for material deﬁnitions that do not have re inforcement (i.e., FRA- 
CRX = 0 and FRACRY = 0).  However, when a reinforce d concrete section is 
deﬁned using *PART_COMPOSITE, and either the shear capacity check is in- 
voked (TYPESC > 0, see Remark 5 ) or CMPFLG is set on *DATABASE_EX-
TENT_BINARY, then it is important for all layers in  the *PART_COMPOSITE 
deﬁnition to have identical material axes.  This ca n be achieved either by using 
the BETA angle on *ELEMENT_SHELL_BETA or by inputti ng identical AOPT 
parameters for all the material deﬁnitions referenc ed by the *PART_COMPOS-
ITE card. 
5.  Through-thickness Shear. In this material model, cracks are initiated only b y 
in-plane stresses caused by axial and bending eﬀect s.  Once a crack has formed, 
the through-thickness shear stress is limited by co nsiderations of aggregate 
interlock or friction on the crack surfaces.  If th e in-plane stresses are insuﬃ- 
cient to cause cracks, the through-thickness shear strength is by default unlim- 
ited.  Thus, failures caused primarily by through-t hickness shear will not be 
predicted.  The Shear Capacity Check option (see TY PESC) allows you to ad- 
dress this limitation.  Two classes of behaviour ar e available (described in a 
and b), together with diﬀerent options for the calculati on of shear capacity 
(described in c and d):  
a)  TYPESC < 10 represents the situation where suﬃcien t shear reinforcement 
will be provided to prevent any through-thickness f ailure.  LS-DYNA 
generates extra history variables, so you can compa re the shear demand to 
shear capacity to assess the requirements for shear  reinforcement (see the *.   
 expansion coeﬃcient as a function of temperature (L CALPC, LCALPR).  These 
apply no matter what types TYPEC and TYPER have bee n selected. 
7.  Erosion Criteria.   Elements are deleted from the calculation when al l of their 
integration points have reached the erosion criteri a.  Because this material 
model can represent plain concrete without reinforc ement, pure reinforcement 
without any concrete, or a smeared combination, the  criteria depends on the 
type being modeled (see Remark 1 ).  There are three criteria: 
a)  Concrete Tensile Strain Limit .  The concrete tensile (crack-opening) strain 
limit ERODET has been exceeded. 
b)  Concrete Compressive Strain Limit .  The concrete compressive strain limit 
ERODEC + |u1D7≠≠csp  has been exceeded. |u1D7≠≠csp  is the strain at which the stress-
strain relation falls to zero. 
c)  Reinforcement Strain Limit.   The reinforcement strain limit ERODER + |u1D7≠≠rsp  
has been exceeded.  |u1D7≠≠rsp  is the strain at which the stress-strain relation falls 
to zero.  However, if LCRSU > 0, |u1D7≠≠rsp  is assumed to be 2.0. 
The table below indicates which of the criteria app ly to each of the variations of 
material type.  Note that FRACR = max (FRACX, FRAC Y ) as discussed in Re- 
mark 1 .

 Tensile response 
 
The concrete is assumed to crack in tension when th e maximum in-plane principal 
stress reaches FT. A non-rotating smeared crack app roach is used.  Cracks can open and 
close repeatedly under hysteretic loading.  When a crack is closed, it can carry 
compression according to the normal compressive str ess-strain relationships.  The 
direction of the crack relative to the element coor dinate system is stored when the crack 
ﬁrst forms.  The material can carry compression par allel to the crack even when the 
crack is open.  Further cracks may then form at pre -determined angles to the ﬁrst crack, 
if the tensile stress in that direction reaches FT.  In versions up to R9, the number of 
further cracks is limited to one, at 90 degrees to the ﬁrst crack.  In versions starting from 
R10, up to three further cracks can form, at 45, 90  and 135 degrees to the ﬁrst crack.  The 
tensile stress is limited to FT only in the availab le crack directions.  The tensile stress in 
other directions is unlimited and could exceed FT. This is a limitation of the non-
rotating crack approach and may lead to models bein g non-conservative, that is, the 
response is stronger than implied by the input.  Th e increase of the possible number of 
cracks from two to four signiﬁcantly reduces this e rror and may therefore cause models 
to seem “weaker” in R10 than in R9 under some loadi ng conditions.  An option to revert 
to the previous 2-crack behavior is available in R1 0 – add 100 to TYPEC. 
 
After initial cracking, the tensile stress reduces with increasing tensile strain.  A ﬁnite 
amount of energy must be absorbed to create a fully  open crack.  In practice the 
reinforcement holds the concrete together, allowing  it to continue to take some tension 
(this eﬀect is known as tension-stiﬀening).  The op tions available for the stress-strain 
curve are shown below.  The piecewise curve is used  by default.  The simple linear 
curve applies only if ESOFT > 0.0 and ECUTEN = 0.0.

 take values 0.0025 and 0.02 respectively. FC max  is also a function of temperature, given 
by the input parameter FC (which applies at 20 oC) times a temperature-dependent 
softening factor taken from EC2.  The diﬀerences am ong TYPEC = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are 
limited to (a) diﬀerent reductions of FC at elevate d temperatures and (b) diﬀerent 
values of |u1D7≠≠c1  at elevated temperatures. 
 
Compressive response for TYPEC = 3 
 
For TYPEC = 3, the stress-strain behaviour follows the same form as described above.  
To over-ride the default values of the Young’s modu lus and |u1D7≠≠cu , set ET36 and ECUT36, 
respectively.  In this case, the strain |u1D7≠≠c1  is calculated from the elastic stiﬀness, and there  
is no thermal sensitivity.  
 
Compressive response for TYPEC = 6 
 
For TYPEC = 6, the above compressive crushing behav iour is replaced with the 
equations proposed by Mander.  This algorithm can m odel unconﬁned or conﬁned 
concrete; for unconﬁned, leave FCC blank.  For conﬁ ned concrete, input the conﬁned 
compressive strength as FCC.   
 
As indicated in Figure M172-3 , |u1D7≠≠c1  is the strain at maximum compressive stress, |u1D7≠≠cu  is 
the ultimate compressive strain, and |u1D7≠≠csp  is the spalling strain.  Default values for these 
quantities for both conﬁned and unconﬁned concrete are calculated as follows: 
|u1D7≠≠c1 = 0.002 × |<racketleftCvJ1 + 5 |parenleftCvJFCC 
FC − 1|parenriµhtCvJ |<racketriµhtCvJ

 The default parameters are intended to be appropria te for a serviceability analysis 
(mean properties), so default FT = f ctm  and default |u1D438 = E cm . For an ultimate load analysis, 
FCC should be the “design compressive strength” (no rmally the factored characteristic 
strength, including any appropriate material factor s); FT should be input as the factored 
characteristic tensile strength; GAMCE9 may be inpu t (a material factor that divides the 
Young’s Modulus so |u1D438 = |u1D438cm GAMCE 9 ⁄ ); and a creep factor PHIEF9 may be input that 
scales |u1D7≠≠c1 by (1 + PHIEF9).  
Unload/Reload Stiffness (All Concrete Types): 
During compressive loading, the elastic modulus wil l be reduced according to the 
parameter UNLFAC (default = 0.5).  See Figure M172-4 .  UNLFAC = 0.0 means no 
reduction, that is, the initial elastic modulus wil l apply during unloading and reloading.  
UNLFAC =1.0 means that unloading results in no perm anent strain.  Intermediate 
values imply a permanent strain linearly interpolat ed between these extremes.  Tensile 
strength is reduced by the same factor as the elast ic modulus. 
Optional Compressive Strength Degradation due to Cr acking: 
By default, the compressive strength of cracked and  uncracked elements is the same.  If 
DEGRAD is non-zero, the formula from BS8110 is used  to reduce compressive strength 
during or after crack opening has occurred:  Figure M172-4.   Concrete unloading behavior A

 RAGG is the crack opening strain at which the input  shear strength TAUMXC 
is halved.  Again, TAUMXC defaults to 1.161 × FT. 
 
Note that if a shear capacity check is speciﬁed, th e above applies only to in-plane shear, 
while the through-thickness shear is unlimited. 
Reinforcement: 
The reinforcement is treated as separate bars provi ding resistance only in the local |u1D46J 
and |u1D466 directions – it does not carry shear in-plane or o ut of plane.  
 
For TYPER = 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, the behaviour is thermally sensitive and follows stress-
strain relationships of a form deﬁned in EC2. At 20oC (or if no thermal input is deﬁned) 
the behaviour is elastic-perfectly-plastic with You ng’s Modulus EREINF and ultimate 
stress SUREINF, up to the onset of failure, after w hich the stress reduces linearly with 
increasing strain until ﬁnal failure.  At elevated temperatures there is a nonlinear 
transition between the elastic phase and the perfec tly plastic phase, and EREINF and 
SUREINF are scaled down by temperature-dependent fa ctors deﬁned in EC2. The strain 
at which failure occurs depends on the reinforcemen t type (TYPER) and the 
temperature.  For example, for hot-rolled reinforci ng steel at 20 oC failure begins at 15% 
strain and is complete at 20% strain. The thermal e xpansion coeﬃcient is as deﬁned in 
EC2 and is a function of temperature.  This may be overridden by inputting the curve 
LCAPLS.  The diﬀerences between TYPER = 1, 2, 4, 7,  8 are limited to (a) diﬀerent 
reductions of EREINF and SUREINF at elevated temper atures, (b) diﬀerent nonlinear 
transitions between elastic and plastic phases and (c) the strains at which softening 
begins and is complete. 
 
The default stress-strain curve for reinforcement m ay be overridden using TYPER = 5 
and LCRSU. In this case, the reinforcement properti es are not temperature-sensitive and 
the yield stress is given by S U REINF × |u1D4J3 (|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst), where |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 is the load curve value at the 
current plastic strain.  To include failure of the reinforcement, the curve should reduce 
to zero at the desired failure strain and remain ze ro for higher strains.  Note that by 
default LS-DYNA re-interpolates the input curve to have 100 equally-spaced points; if 
the last point on the curve is at very high strain,  then the initial part of the curve may 
become poorly deﬁned. *
