  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
least 2 points should be deﬁned.  The ﬁrst point mu st be zero 
corresponding to the initial yield stress.  WARN ING: If the ﬁrst 
point is nonzero, the yield stress is extrapolated to dete rmine the 
initial yield.  If this option is used, SIGY and ET AN are ignored 
and may be input as zero. 
ES1 - ES8 Corresponding yield stress values to EPS1  - EPS8. 
Remarks: 
By deﬁning the tangent modulus ETAN, the stress str ain behavior is treated using a 
bilinear stress strain curve.  Alternately, a curve  similar to that shown in Figure M10-1  is 
expected to be deﬁned by (EPS1, ES1)  - (EPS 8, ES 8); however, an eﬀective stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain curve (LCSS) ma y be input instead if eight points are 
insuﬃcient.  The cost is roughly the same for eithe r approach.  The most general 
approach is to use the table deﬁnition (LCSS) discu ssed below. 
 
Three options to account for strain rate eﬀects are  possible. 
1.  Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  , 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate, |u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
2.  For complete generality a load curve (LCSR) to sca le the yield stress may be 
input instead.  In this curve the scale factor as a  function of strain rate is de- 
ﬁned.   
3.  If diﬀerent stress as a function of strain curves can be provided for various 
strain rates, the option using the reference to a t able (LCSS) can be used.  Then 
the table input in *DEFINE_TABLE must be used; see Figure M24-1 .*
