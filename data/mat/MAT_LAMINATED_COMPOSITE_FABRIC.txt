LCDFAIL Load-Curve ID, that deﬁnes orientation dependent failure strains.  
The ordinate values in the load- curve deﬁne the various failure 
strains, in the following order: 
1.  EF_11T: tensile failure strain in longitudinal |u1D44∆-direction 
2.  EF_11C: compressive failure strain in longitudinal  |u1D44∆-
direction 
3.  EF_22T: tensile failure strain in transverse |u1D44F-direction 
4.  EF_22C: compressive failure strain in transverse |u1D44F-
direction 
5.  EF_12: in-plane shear failure strain in |u1D44∆|u1D44F -plane 
6.  EF_33T: tensile failure strain in transverse /u1D450-direction 
7.  EF_33C: compressive failure strain in transverse /u1D450-
direction 
8.  EF_23: out-of plane shear failure strain in |u1D44F /u1D450-plane 
9.  EF_31: out-of plane shear failure strain in /u1D450|u1D44∆ -plane 
 
Thus, the load- curve to deﬁne these values has to have either 5 
(shells) or 9 (solids) entries in its deﬁnition.  A  load- curve 
deﬁnition with 9 entries may be used for shells, ig noring the last 4 
entries.  The abscissa values are i gnored but need to be ascending, 
i.e. 1.0, 2.0, …, 9.0.

2-434 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 identical to the strength, which is similar to idea l elastoplastic behavior.  For 
tensile failure a small value for SLIMT x is often reasonable; however, for com- 
pression SLIMC x = 1.0 is preferred.  This is also valid for the corr esponding 
shear value. 
If SLIM xx  is smaller than 1.0, then localization can be obse rved depending on 
the total behavior of the lay-up.  If the user is i ntentionally using SLIM xx  < 1.0, 
it is generally recommended to avoid a drop to zero  and set the value to some- 
thing in between 0.05 and 0.10. Then elastoplastic behavior is achieved in the 
limit which often leads to less numerical problems.   The defaults for SLIM xx  
are 10 -8. 
3.  Crashfront.   The crashfront-algorithm is started if and only i f a value for 
TSIZE is input.  Note that time step size, with ele ment elimination after the 
actual time step becomes smaller than TSIZE. 
4.  Damage.  The damage parameters can be written to the post pr ocessing 
database for each integration point as the ﬁrst thr ee additional element varia- 
bles and can be visualized. 
Material models with FS = 1 or FS = -1 are better f or complete laminates and 
fabrics, as all directions are treated in a similar  fashion. 
For material model FS = 1 an interaction between no rmal stresses and the shear 
stresses is assumed for the evolution of damage in the |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F-directions.  The /u1D̅0F
