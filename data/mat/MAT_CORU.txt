 S_VEGTER), a plane stress 
orthotropic material model for metal forming.  Yiel d surface construction is based on 
the interpolation by second-order Bezier curves, an d model parameters are determined 
directly from a set of mechanical tests conducted f or several directions.  For each 
direction, four mechanical tests are carried out: a  uniaxial, an equi-biaxial, a plane strain 
tensile test and a shear test.  These test results are used to determine the coeﬃcients of 
the Fourier directional dependency ﬁeld.  For a mor e detailed description please see 
Vegter and Boogaard [2006].
