  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
FFLG Flag for stress-based or strain-based failure:  
EQ.0: XT is a stress to failure. 
NE.0: XT is a strain to failure.

When locking occurs, the fabric yarns are packed an d behave like elastic media.  The 
discount factor is unity as shown in the next ﬁgure .  The micro-mechanical model is 
developed to account for the reorientation of the y arns up to the locking angle.  The 
locking angle, /u1D̅0:loc k , can be obtained from the yarn width and the spaci ng parameter of 
the fabric using simple geometrical relationship.  The transition range, ∆/u1D̅0: (angle 
tolerance for locking), can be chosen to be as smal l as possible, but big enough to 
prevent high frequency oscillations during the tran sition to the compacted state which 
depends on the range to the locking angle and the d ynamics of the simulated problem.  
The reorientation damping constant damps some of th e high frequency oscillations.  A 
simple rate eﬀect is added by deﬁning the viscous m odulus for normal or shear strain 
rate ( V ME × |u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst|oneCst or |twoCst|twoCst  for normal components and V MS × |u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst|twoCst  for the shear components).
