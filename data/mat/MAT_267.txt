Remarks:   
Basic Theory.   This model is based on the work done by Arruda an d Boyce [1993], 
in particular Arruda’s thesis [1992].  The eight ch ain rubber model is based on 
hyper-elasticity, and it is formulated by using ela stic strain invariants.  Strain 
softening is accounted for by the parameter from |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst following the work done by Qi 
and Boyce [2004]. 
 
The strain energy is deﬁned in terms of the elastic  deformation gradient /u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst through 
the right Cauchy-Green tensor /u1D46A|u1D4J2Cst=/u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst|u1D447Cst/u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst and its determinant /u1D4:D|u1D4J2Cst= det /u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst as /u1D6F∫=/u1D6F∫|oneCst+
/u1D6F∫|twoCst where 
 
/u1D6F∫|oneCst= |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst|u1D7≠7|<racketleftCvJ/radical.v1/u1D441/u1D6EC|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D6FD +/u1D441ln |parenleftCvJ|u1D6FD

/u1D4:D|u1D4J2Cst/u1D̅08.stcon − 1|parenriµhtCv6  
is the volumetric contribution.  Here 
 
|u1D6FD =ℒ−|oneCst
⎝⎜⎛Λ|u1D4J≠Cst
/radical.v1/u1D441⎠⎟⎞ 
with ℒ−|oneCst denoting the inverse of the Langevin function ℒ(|u1D46J) = coth|u1D46J − 1/|u1D46J  and the 
ampliﬁed chain stretch is given by  
Λ|u1D4J≠Cst=/radical.v2/u1D44B(|u1D463|u1D46≠Cst)|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠6/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|twoCst− 1|parenriµhtCv2 + 1 , 
where |u1D7≠6/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|twoCst= Tr|parenleftCv1/u1D46A̅|u1D4J2Cst|parenriµhtCv1 3 ⁄ and /u1D46A̅|u1D4J2Cst=/u1D4:D|u1D4J2Cst−|twoCst/|threeCst/u1D46A|u1D4J2Cst. 
 
Among the constant parameters we have |u1D7≠7 is the initial modulus of the soft domain, 
/u1D̅05 the bulk modulus, /u1D̅08con  a pressure inﬂuential exponent and  /u1D441 is the number of 
rigid links between crosslinks of the soft domain r egion. /u1D44B is a general polynomial 
describing the interaction between the soft and har d phases (Qi and Boyce [2004] 
and Tobin and Mullins [1957]).  It is given by 
/u1D44B(|u1D463|u1D46≠Cst) = 1 + |u1D434(1 − |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst) + |u1D43J(1 − |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst)|twoCst *.   
 b)  VISEL = 2.   With this option the evolution is based on work d one by Simo 
and Hughes (2000).

The number of Prony terms is restricted to a maximu m of 6.  Also /u1D̅0F/u1D6FC.st and 
|u1D6F∆/u1D6FC.st must be greater than 0.  The Cauchy stress is obta ined by a push for- 
ward operation on the total second Piola-Kirchhoﬀ s tress.

and the hardening is either based on a load curve I D (-YLD0) or an extended Voce 
hardening 
|u1D7≠∆yld = |u1D7≠∆yld0+ |u1D444|oneCst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2|u1D43JCst|oneCsts|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D444|twoCst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2|u1D43JCst|twoCsts|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D444|threeCst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2|u1D43JCst|threeCsts|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D444|fourCst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2|u1D43JCst/four.sts|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|parenriµhtCv2  . 
The evolution of the elastic deformation gradient /u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst is written as 
 
/u1D46Ḋ|u1D4J2Cst= (/u1D4̅:−/u1D4̅:|u1D4JDCst)/u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst 
 
where /u1D4̅: is the spatial velocity gradient and /u1D4̅:|u1D4JDCst is the spatial (Eulerian) plastic 
velocity gradient which is given by the associative  ﬂow rule 
/u1D4̅:|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠̅̇|u1D71J|u1D4J3 
|u1D71J/u1D̅48 
 
with |u1D4J3 being the rate independent yield surface 
|u1D4J3 = |u1D7≠∆eff − |u1D7≠∆yld . 
For rate independent plasticity ( VISPL = 0 ) the evolution of plastic strain |u1D7≠≠̅ follows 
from the consistency conditions |u1D4J3 ≤ 0 , |u1D7≠≠̅̇≥ 0 and |u1D4J3 |u1D7≠≠̅̇= 0. For viscoplasticity these 
conditions are abandoned, but we instead invoke a c onstitutive equation for the 
eﬀective plastic strain rate.  This is the Perzyna (1966) overstress model, and three 
diﬀerent formulations are available. 
a)  VISPL = 1 .  The evolution equation is 
|u1D7≠≠̅̇= |parenleftCvJmax (|u1D4J3 , 0)
|u1D43∆|oneCst|parenriµhtCvJ/u1D446.st|oneCsts
  , 
where |u1D43∆|oneCst and |u1D446|oneCst are viscoplastic material parameters. 
b)  VISPL = 2 .  The evolution equation is *
