  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
SO Strain (logarithmic) output option to control what is written as 
component 7 to the d3plot  database.  (LS- PrePost always blindly 
labels this component as eﬀective plastic strain.)  The maximum 
values are updated for each element each time step:  
EQ.0.0: maximum principal strain that occurs during the 
calculation 
EQ.1.0: maximum magnitude of the principal strain values th at 
occurs during the calculation 
EQ.2.0: maximum eﬀective strain that occurs during the 
calculation 
E_MIN Minimum strain used to generate the load curv e from |u1D436|u1D4J6Cst. The 
default range is - 0.9 to 5.1. The computed solution will be more 
accurate if the user speciﬁes the range used to ﬁt the |u1D436|u1D4J6Cst. Linear 
extrapolation is used outside the speciﬁed range. 
E_MAX Maximum strain used to generate the load curv e from |u1D436|u1D4J6Cst.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
Ci Coeﬃcients of the instantaneous elastic response in  compression 
and tension.  Deﬁne these coeﬃcients only if LC2 is  set to zero. 
Remarks: 
The equations for the original model (FORM = 0) are  given as: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D449Cst(|u1D461) =/integral.v:|u1D43A(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D461Cst

∂|u1D7≠≠∂|u1D7≠≠
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F 
|u1D43A(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st |u1D461Cst 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D7≠≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠) = |summationCv1 |u1D436|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J8Cst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst 
where |u1D43A is the shear modulus.  Eﬀective strain (which can be written to the d3plot  
database) is calculated as follows: 
|u1D7≠≠eff =/radical.v52

The polynomial for instantaneous elastic response s hould contain only odd terms if 
symmetric tension-compression response is desired. 
 
The new model (FORM = 1) is based on the hyperelast ic model used in *
