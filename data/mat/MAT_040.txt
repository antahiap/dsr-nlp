LS-DYNA R13 2-377 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
EQ.1.0:  Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y a 
point in spac e and the global location of the element 
center; this is the |u1D44∆-direction.  This option is for solid 
elements only. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR. 
EQ.3.0: Local ly orthotropic material axes determined by 
rotating the material axes about the element normal  by 
an angle, BE TA, from a line in the plane of the element 
deﬁned by the cross product of the vector v with th e 
element normal.  The plane of a solid element i s the 
midsurface between the inner surface and outer surf ace 
deﬁned by the ﬁrst four nodes and the last four nod es 
of the connectivity of the element, respectively. 
EQ.4.0: locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, /u1D42∫, which deﬁne the centerline ax- 
is.  This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR).   
MACF Material axes change ﬂag: 
EQ.1: No change, default, 
EQ.2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F, 
EQ.3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450, 
EQ.4: Switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450. 
ATRACK Material a-axis tracking ﬂag (shell elements  only) 
EQ.0:  |u1D44∆-axis rotates with element (default) 
EQ.1:  |u1D44∆-axis also tracks deformation 
XP, YP, ZP Deﬁne coordinates of point /u1D42∫ for AOPT = 1 and 4. 
A1, A2, A3 (|u1D44∆|oneCst,|u1D44∆|twoCst,|u1D44∆|threeCst) deﬁne components of vector /u1D41A for AOPT = 2. 
D1, D2, D3 (|u1D4J1|oneCst,|u1D4J1|twoCst,|u1D4J1|threeCst) deﬁne components of vector /u1D41D for AOPT = 2. *
