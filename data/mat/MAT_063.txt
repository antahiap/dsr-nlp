  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
PR (Elastic) Poisson’s ratio 
LCID MODEL.EQ.0:  Load curve ID deﬁning yield stress as a function 
of volumetric strain, |u1D6F∆ (see Figure M63-1 ). 
MODEL.EQ.1:  Load curve or table ID. If a load curve ID is 
speciﬁed, then the load curve deﬁnes uniaxial 
yield stress as a function of equivalent plastic 
strain.  If a table ID is speciﬁed, then each strai n 
rate references a load curve ID that gives uniaxi- 
al yield stress as a function of equivalent plastic  
strain.   
TSC Tensile stress cutoﬀ (only for MODEL = 0).  A nonzero, positive 
value is strongly recommended for realistic behavio r. 
DAMP Rate sensitivity via damping coeﬃcient (.05 <  recommended 
value < .50).  Only available for MODEL = 0. 
MODEL Choice of material model formulation: 
EQ.0: von Mises yield condition (default), 
EQ.1: Elliptical yield surface in |u1D4JD-/u1D45E space. 
PRP Plastic Poisson’s ratio (only for MODEL = 1).  PRP determines the 
yield potential, that is, the direction of plastic ﬂow.  It ranges from 
-1 to 0.5. 
K Ratio of uniaxial yie ld stress to hydrostatic yield stress under 
compression (only for MODEL = 1).  K determines the shape of 
the yield ellipse. 
RFILTF Rate ﬁltering parameter (for MODEL = 1):  
EQ.0.0: Plastic strain rates are used if LCID is a table (d efault).  
GT.0.0: Filtered total strain rates are used if LCID is a t able.  
See Remark 2 . 
BVFLAG Bulk viscosity deactivation ﬂag (for MODEL =  1):  
EQ.0.0: Bulk viscosity active (default). 
EQ.1.0: No bulk viscosity *.   
 2.  Elliptical Yield Surface Formulation.   An alternative formulation for 
crushable foam can be invoked by setting MODEL = 1.  It has the following 
yield condition: 
|u1D439 =/radical.v2/u1D45E|twoCst+ |u1D6F+|twoCst|u1D4JD|twoCst− |u1D43J|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenriµhtCv1 = 0  , 
corresponding to an elliptical yield surface in the  pressure ( |u1D4JD) – deviator Mises 
stress ( /u1D45E) space; see Figure M63-2 . In the above yield condition,  
|u1D4JD = −1

|u1D43J|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenriµhtCv1 = |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst/co⋯⋯a.stuniaxial /radical.v51 + |parenleftCv4|u1D6F+

|u1D43J|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenriµhtCv1, the yield stress, gives the size of the /u1D45E-axis of elliptical yield surface.  /u1D458, 
the stress ratio, is given by 
/u1D458=|u1D7≠∆|zeroCst|u1D466Cst/co⋯⋯a.st uniaxial 
|u1D7≠∆|zeroCst|u1D466Cst/co⋯⋯a.st  hydrostatic   . 
/u1D458 describes the shape of the yield surface and is in put as ﬁeld K.  It ranges from 
0 (von Mises) to less than 3.  1 3 hydrostatic compression  /u1D45E=/radical.v13 /u1D4:D|twoCst
