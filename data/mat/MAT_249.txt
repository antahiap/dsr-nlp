GE.1: Use *INITIAL_STRESS_ SHELL to initialize some 
material properties on an element-by- element basis (see 
Remark 3  below). 
Remarks: 
1.  Stress Calculation.   This material features an additive split of the m atrix and 
reinforcement contributions to the stress.  Therefo re, the combined stress re- 
sponse, /u1D̅48, equals the sum  /u1D̅48|u1D4JACst+/u1D̅48/u1D45:.st. 
The matrix model uses an elastic-plastic material f ormulation with a von-Mises 
yield criterion.  Material parameters, such as Youn g’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio 
and yield stress, can be given as functions of temp erature.  This material sup- 
ports a mixed hardening approach. 
We formulated the contribution of the ﬁber reinforc ement as a hyperelastic 
material.  Based on the orientation angle, |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst, of the ith  ﬁber family, LS-DYNA 
computes an initial ﬁber direction in the element c oordinate system /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst. By 
using the deformation gradient, /u1D405, the current ﬁber conﬁguration is given as 
/u1D426|iCst=/u1D405 /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst, containing all necessary information on ﬁber stra in and reorienta- 
tion.  Here, this vector is always orthogonal to th e shell normal and can, thus, 
be represented by the two in-plane vector component s. 
Following standard textbook mechanics for anisotrop ic and hyperelastic mate- 
rials, the elastic stresses within the ﬁbers due to  tension or compression are 
given as  *.

The above table also shows the order of output as w ell as the number of extra 
history variables associated with the particular ﬂa g.  In total NXH extra varia- 
bles are required depending on the choice of parame ter POSTV. For example, 
the maximum number of additional variables is NXH =  32 for POSTV = 127. 
As mentioned in Remark 1  ﬁber orientation is represented in the material su b- 
routine as vector /u1D426|iCst deﬁned in the element coordinate system.  Prior to  writing 
to the list of histories the vector is transformed into the global coordinate sys- 
tem with three vector components for |u1D44∆|fourCst= 1 and/or into the overall material 
coordinate system with two vector components for |u1D44∆|sevenCst= 1.

table, then tw o diﬀerent damage functions for tensile and 
compressive stresses are input.  The values in the table are

tensile and compressive stresses.  Any other curves  input with the

The damager parameter |u1D4J1|oneCst/u1D45:.st ranges from 0.0 for an undamaged 
ﬁber to 1.0 for a failed ﬁber family.  If all famil ies have failed,

values are ﬁber strain rates which index damage as a function of 
ﬁber strain curves. 
The damager parameter |u1D4J1|oneCst|u1D4JACst ranges from 0.0 to 1.5. A value of 0.0 
indicates an undamaged matrix, whereas 1.0 refers t o a

at the integration point, a matrix damage |u1D4J1|oneCst|u1D4JACst of 1.5 must be

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
GE.1:  Use *INITIAL_STRESS_ SHELL to initialize some 
material properties on an element-by-ele ment basis (see 
Remark 5  below). 
Remarks: 
1.  Stress Calculation.   This material features an additive split of the m atrix and 
reinforcement contributions to the stress.  Therefo re, the combined stress re- 
sponse, /u1D̅48, equals the sum  /u1D̅48|u1D4JACst+/u1D̅48/u1D45:.st. 
The matrix uses an elastic-plastic material formula tion with a von-Mises yield 
criterion.  This material supports a mixed hardenin g approach. 
We formulated the contribution of the ﬁber reinforc ement as a hyperelastic 
material.  Based on the orientation angle, |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst, of the ith  ﬁber family, LS-DYNA 
computes an initial ﬁber direction in the element c oordinate system /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst. By 
using the deformation gradient, /u1D405, the current ﬁber conﬁguration is given as 
/u1D426|iCst=/u1D405 /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst, containing all necessary information on ﬁber stra in and reorienta- 
tion.  Here, this vector is always orthogonal to th e shell normal and can, thus, 
be represented by the two in-plane vector component s. 
Following standard textbook mechanics for anisotrop ic and hyperelastic mate- 
rials, the elastic stresses within the ﬁbers due to  tension or compression are 
given as  
/u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/u1D45:.st= |summationCv1/u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst)|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst= |summationCv11
/u1D4:D|u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst)(/u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst)|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  , 
where the function |u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst of the ﬁber strain |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst corresponds to the load curve LCEF i. 
|u1D4JB is the number of ﬁber families. 
The shear behavior of the reinforcement can be cont rolled by METH ij.  For val- 
ues less than 10, the behavior is again standard te xtbook mechanics: 
/u1D̅48/u1D446.st/u1D45:.st= |summationCv1/u1D̅48/u1D446.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst/u1D45:.st|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst= |summationCv11
/u1D4:D|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst(/u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst)(/u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst+|oneCst)|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
Here /u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst represents the employed shear measure (scalar prod uct or shear 
angle in radians).  In general, the dyadic product /u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst+|oneCst does not deﬁne a 
shear stress tensor.  This formulation might result  in unphysical shear behavior 
in the case of woven fabrics.  Therefore, we devise d METH ij  = 10 and 11 to 
always give a pure shear stress tensor, /u1D̅48/u1D446.st/u1D45:.st.  *. _CRASH  
 Matrix failure ( |u1D4J1|u1D4JACst= 1.0 ) does not necessarily initiate failure of the comp osite 
material.  In this implementation, matrix damage pa rameters |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JACst and |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst|u1D4JACst that 
exceed a value of 1.0 are admissible.  Failure of t he composite is initiated as 
soon as the damage parameter reaches 1.5. To accoun t for this delayed failure, 
the degradation of the matrix stresses is given by:  
/u1D̅48/circum⨂lexcmb.h1|u1D4JACst= |parenleftCv21 − min |parenleftCv11.0, |u1D4J1|u1D4JACst|parenriµhtCv1|parenriµhtCv2/u1D̅48|u1D4JACst  . 
3.  Fiber Viscosity.   Input parameter VISC activates ﬁber viscosity.  Thi s feature 
adds numerical damping to the post-damage behavior of the material.  Damp- 
ing might be necessary since brittle ﬁber failure t ends to induce shockwaves 
through the material, resulting in oscillations or even unphysical damage 
propagation.  
If activated, an additional viscous stress term is added to the ﬁber contribution: 
/u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D463Cst/u1D45:.st= |summationCv11
/u1D4:D⎝⎜⎛/integral.v:|u1D4J3|u1D463Cst(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D71J|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst(/u1D̅0F)

⎠⎟⎞(/u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst)|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
The relaxation function, |u1D4J3|u1D463Cst, is represented by up to four terms of the Prony 
series expansions and thus reads 
|u1D4J3|u1D463Cst(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J8Csts|u1D461Cst
|u1D4J8Cst 
with relaxation moduli |u1D43A|u1D4J8Cst and decay constants |u1D6FD|u1D4J8Cst. 
4.  History Data.   This material formulation outputs to d3plot  additional data for 
post-processing to the set of history variables if requested.  The parameter 
POSTV speciﬁes the data to be written.  Its value i s calculated as 
POST V = |u1D44∆|oneCst+ 2 |u1D44∆|twoCst+ 4 |u1D44∆|threeCst+8 |u1D44∆|fourCst+ 16 |u1D44∆|fiveCst+ 32 |u1D44∆|sixCst+ 64 |u1D44∆|sevenCst. 
Each ﬂag  |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary number (can be either 1 or 0) and corr esponds to one 
particular type of post-processing variable accordi ng to the following table.

 5.  Description of IHIS.   Some material data can be initialized on an element -by-
element basis through history variables deﬁned with  *INITIAL_STRESS_-
SHELL starting at position HISV5.   
How the data is interpreted depends on the paramete r IHIS. Following the 
same concept as for parameter POSTV, the value of I HIS is computed by the 
following expression: 
I H IS = |u1D44∆|oneCst+ 2 |u1D44∆|twoCst 
Each ﬂag  |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary number (can be either 1 or 0) and corr esponds to one 
particular type of material variable.  So far, the only material variables imple- 
mented are ﬁber orientation in two diﬀerent coordin ate systems, global and 
material.  Thus, at most one of the ﬂags |u1D44∆|oneCst and |u1D44∆|twoCst should be set to 1.

Stress Calculation: 
In this model up to three distinct ﬁber families ar e considered.  We assume that there is 
no interaction between the families.  Thus, the res ulting stress tensor is the sum of the 
single ﬁber responses.  Each ﬁber response is the s um of an isotropic and a spatially 
transversely isotropic neo-Hookean stress contribut ion, /u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cst|iCst|sCst /o.st  and /u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cst|tCst /r.st , respectively. The 
implementation is based on the work of Bonet and Bu rton (1998), adapted by BMW for 
simulation of unidirectional fabrics (see reference s below).  
 
The isotropic stress tensor, /u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cstiso , depends on an isotropic shear modulus, |u1D7≠7, and an 
isotropic bulk modulus, |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst where:  
|u1D7≠7 =|u1D438|iCst|sCst /o.st 
2(1 +/u1D̅08) and |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst=|u1D438|iCst|sCst /o.st (/u1D̅08+ |u1D4JB|u1D4J6Cst/u1D̅08|twoCst)
2(1 +/u1D̅08). 
Here, the variable |u1D4JB|u1D4J6Cst denotes the ratio between stiﬀness orthogonally to  the ﬁbers and in 
ﬁber direction, that is, |u1D4JB|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D438|iCst|sCst /o.st /|u1D438|u1D4J6Cst.  |u1D438iso , /u1D̅08, and |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst are input parameters.  Using the left 
Cauchy-Green tensor, /u1D41B, the isotropic neo-Hookean model reads: 
/u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cst|iCst|sCst /o.st =|u1D7≠7
/u1D4:D(/u1D41B−/u1D408) + |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst(/u1D4:D− 1)/u1D408 . 
 
Based on the orientation angel |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst of the ith  ﬁber family, an initial ﬁber direction /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst is 
computed.  The deformation gradient, /u1D405, transforms the initial ﬁber conﬁguration to the 
current ﬁber conﬁguration as /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst=/u1D405 /u1D426 |u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst. This vector contains all necessary information 
on ﬁber elongation and reorientation.
