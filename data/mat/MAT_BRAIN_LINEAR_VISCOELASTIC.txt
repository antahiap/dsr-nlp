This is Material Type 164.  This material is a Kelv in-Maxwell model for modeling brain 
tissue, which is valid for solid elements only.  Se e Remarks below.

SO Strain (logarithmic) output option to control what is written as 
component 7 to the d3plot  database.  (LS- PrePost always blindly 
labels this component as eﬀective plastic strain.) The maximum 
values are updated for each element each time step:  
EQ.0.0: Maximum principal strain that occurs during the 
calculation 
EQ.1.0: Maximum magnitude of the principal strai n values that *.

occurs during the calculation 
EQ.2.0: Maximum eﬀective strain that occurs during the 
calculation 
Remarks: 
1.  Maxwell Model.   The shear relaxation behavior is described for th e Maxwell 
model by: 
|u1D43A(|u1D461) = |u1D43A + (|u1D43A|zeroCst− |u1D43A∞)|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st |u1D461Cst  . 
A Jaumann rate formulation is used 
|u1D7≠∆/u1D6FB.st
|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = 2/integral.v:|u1D43A(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D437|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst(/u1D̅0F)|u1D4J1|u1D461 |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst  , 
where the prime denotes the deviatoric part of the stress rate, |u1D7≠∆/na˙la.st
|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , and the strain 
rate |u1D437|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst .   
2.  Kelvin Model.   For the Kelvin model the stress evolution equatio n is deﬁned 
as: 
|u1D46≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst +1
/u1D̅0F|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |parenleftCv21 + |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenriµhtCv2|u1D43A|zeroCst|u1D4J2̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst + |parenleftCv21 + |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenriµhtCv2|u1D43A∞
/u1D̅0F|u1D4J2̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   . 
The strain data as written to the d3plot  database may be used to predict dam- 
age, see [Bandak 1991]. *
