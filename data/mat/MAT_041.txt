Type I I I I I I   
 
 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
IVECT Vectorization ﬂag: 
EQ.0:  Oﬀ 
EQ.1:  On.  A vectorized user subroutine must be supplied . 
IFAIL Failure ﬂag. 
EQ.0: No failure 
EQ.1: Allows failure of shell and solid elements 
LT.0: |IFAIL|  is the address of NU MINT in the material 
constants array.  NU MINT is deﬁned as the number of 
failed integration points that will trigger element  dele- 
tion.  This option applies only to shell and solid elements 
(release 5 of version 971). 
ITHERM Temperature ﬂag: 
EQ.0:  Oﬀ 
EQ.1:  On.  Compute element temperature. 
IHYPER Deformation gradient ﬂag (see Appendix A): 
EQ.0: Do not compute deformation gradient. 
EQ.-1: Same as 1, except if IORTHO = 1 or 3, the deformation 
gradient is in the global coordinate system. 
EQ.-10: Same as - 1, except that this will enforce full integration 
for elements -1, -2 and 2. 
EQ.1: Compute deformation gradient for bricks and shells.   If 
IORTHO = 1 or 3, the deformation gradient is in the  lo- 
cal coordinate system instead of the global coordin ate 
system.  
EQ.10: Same as 1, except that this will enforce full integ ration 
for elements -1, -2 and 2. 
EQ.3: Compute deformation gradient for shells from the *. -050  
LS-DYNA R13 2-383 (MAT)  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate sys tem ID 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COOR DINATE_NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DE-
FINE_COORDINATE_VECTOR).  Available in R3 ver- 
sion of 971 and later. 
MACF Material axes change ﬂag for brick elements fo r quick changes: 
EQ.1: No change, default 
EQ.2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F 
EQ.3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450 
EQ.4: Switch material axes |u1D44F and  /u1D450

D1, D2, D3 Components of vector /u1D41D for AOPT = 2 
BETA Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 0 (shells only) and 
AOPT = 3.   BE TA may be overridden on the element card; see

LS-DYNA R13 2-385 (MAT) b)  P2.   The second parameter, P2, speciﬁes the number of integration points 
(one to four) that are required to fail for the ele ment to fail.  If it is zero, 
the element will not fail regardless of IFAIL. The recommended value for 
P2 is 1. 
c)  Other Parameters.   The cohesive element only uses MID, RO, MT, LMC, 
NHV, IFAIL and IVECT in addition to the material pa rameters. 
d)  Appendix R.   See Appendix R for the speciﬁcs of the umat  subroutine re- 
quirements for the cohesive element. 
2.  Material Constants.   If IORTHO = 0, LMC must be ≤ 48.  If IORTHO = 1, LMC 
must be ≤ 40.  If more material constants are neede d, LMCA may be used to 
create an additional material constant array.  Ther e is no limit on the size of 
LMCA. 
3.  Spot weld thinning.   If the user-deﬁned material is used for beam or b rick 
element spot welds that are tied to shell elements,  and SPOTHIN > 0 on *CON-
TROL_CONTACT, then spot weld thinning will be done for those shells if IS-
POT = 2.  Otherwise, it will not be done.  
4.  Thick Shell Formulation 5.   IEVTS is optional and is used only by thick shell  
formulation 5.  It points to the position of |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst in the material constants array.  
Following |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst, the next 5 material constants must be |u1D438|u1D44FCst, |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst, /u1D̅08|u1D44FCst|u1D44∆Cst , /u1D̅08|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst , and /u1D̅08|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44FCst .  
This data enables thick shell formulation 5 to calc ulate an accurate thickness 
strain, otherwise the thickness strain will be base d on the elastic constants 
pointed to by IBULK and IG. *
