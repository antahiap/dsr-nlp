This is  Material Type 147.  This is an isotropic material w ith damage and is available for 
solid elements.  The model has a modiﬁed Mohr-Coulo mb surface to determine the 
pressure dependent peak shear strength.  It was dev eloped for applications involving 
roadbase soils by Lewis [1999] for the FHWA, who ex tended the work of Abbo and 
Sloan [1995] to include excess pore water eﬀects.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
NPLOT Controls what is written as component 7 to the d3plot  database.  
LS-PrePost always blindly labels this component as eﬀe ctive 
plastic strain.
