LCCHEXP |LCC H EXP | is a load curve ID deﬁning the coeﬃcient for chemical 
shrinkage |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+)  as a function of the state of cure, |u1D6F+. If set, 
parameters CHEXP1, CHEXP2 and CHEXP3 are ignored.  See 
Remark 1  below. 
LCTHEXP |LCT H EXP | is a l oad curve ID or table ID deﬁning the coeﬃcient 
of thermal expansion  |u1D6FD(|u1D6F+, |u1D447)  as a function of cure, |u1D6F+, and 
temperature, |u1D447. If referring to a load curve, parameter |u1D6FD(|u1D447)  is a 
function of temperature,  |u1D447. 
R Gas constant, |u1D44J, for Kamal model 
TREFEXP Reference temperature, |u1D4470, for secant form of thermal expansion.  
See Remark 1  below. 
DOCREXP Reference degree of cure, |u1D6F+0, for sequential form of chemical 
expansion.  See Remark 1  below. 
WLFTREF Reference temperature for either the Arrhen ius or Williams-
Landel- Ferry shift function (must be greater than zero for  the shift 
function).  Set to zero (along with WL FA and WLFB) to not apply 
scaling.  See Remark 2 . *.   
 |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+) = |u1D6F∆|twoCst|u1D6F+|twoCst+ |u1D6F∆|oneCst|u1D6F+ + |u1D6F∆|zeroCst  . 
For positive values of the parameter LCCHEXP, a diﬀ erential form is used to 
compute the chemical strains: 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ ch = |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+)|u1D4J1|u1D6F+  . 
Otherwise a secant form deﬁnes the strains: 
|u1D7≠≠ch = |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+)(|u1D6F+ − |u1D6F+|zeroCst) − |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+/u1D4:C.st)(|u1D6F+/u1D4:C.st− |u1D6F+|zeroCst)  . 
Consequently, the deﬁnition of |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+)  as quadratic expression goes along the 
secant formulation. 
Analogously, the thermal strains are either deﬁned in a secant or diﬀerential 
form, depending on the load curve parameter LCTHEXP . For positive values 
of that parameter , the diﬀerential form is applied, otherwise the sec ant form is 
used.  For the latter the reference temperature |u1D447|zeroCst is identiﬁed with the input 
parameter TREFEXP. In both cases the coeﬃcient of t hermal expansion can be 
given as table depending on degree of cure and temp erature. 
Finally, the Cauchy stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6 /u1D45̅, is related to the strain rate by  
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst (|u1D461) =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (/u1D̅0F)
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst  . 
The relaxation functions |u1D4J4|u1D4J6 /u1D45̅/u1D458/u1D45∫(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) are represented in this material formulation 
by up to 16 terms (not including the instantaneous modulus |u1D43A0) of the Prony 
series: 
g(|u1D461, |u1D6F+) = |u1D43A|zeroCst(|u1D6F+) − |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D6F+)
|u1D4J6Cst+ |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D6F+)
|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts|u1D461Cst  . 
For the sake of simplicity, a constant ratio |u1D43A|u1D4J6(|u1D6F+)|u1D43A0(|u1D6F+) ⁄ for all degrees of cure is 
assumed.  Consequently, it suﬃces to deﬁne one term  |u1D43A0(|u1D6F+) as a function of the 
degree of cure and further coeﬃcients for the fully  cured state of the adhesive: 
g(|u1D461, |u1D6F+) = |u1D43A|zeroCst(|u1D6F+)

2.  Temperature Effect on the Stress Relaxation.  A possible temperature eﬀect 
on the stress relaxation (see Remark 1 ) is accounted for by the Williams-
Landel-Ferry (WLF) shift function or the Arrhenius shift function.  For details 
on this function, please see material formulation 7 6, *. .  It was develope d with the collaboration of Professor 
Tabiei from UC.  .  provides the viscoelastic behav ior of epoxy resin.  Both the epoxy 
resin and the ﬁber orientation and deformation cont ribute to the overall stress.
