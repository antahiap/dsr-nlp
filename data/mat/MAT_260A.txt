  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
R00, R45, 
R90 Lankford parameters in rolling ( 0°), diagonal ( 45 °) and transverse 
(90 °) directions, respectively; determined from experim ents.  Note 
if |u1D44J00 , |u1D44J45  and |u1D44J90  are not deﬁned or set as 0.0, then |u1D44J00 = |u1D44J45 =
|u1D44J90 =1.0, which degenerates to the Von-Mises yield. 
SIG00, 
SIG45, 
SIG90, SIG_B SIG00: the initial yield stress from uniaxial tension tests in rolling 
(0°) direction;  
SIG45: the initial yield stress from uniaxial tension tests in 
diagonal ( 45 °) direction; 
SIG90: the initial yield stress from uniaxial tension tests in 
transverse( 90 °)  directions; 
SIG_B: the initial yield stress from equi-biaxial s tretching tests. 
Note if SIG00, SIG45, SIG90 and SIG_ B are not deﬁned, they will 
be set to the ﬁrst stress point deﬁned by LCIDS, an d it 
degenerates to the associated ﬂow rule. 
LCIDS ID of a load curve deﬁning stress vs.  strain harde ning behavior 
from a uniaxial tension test along the rolling dire ction. 
LCIDV ID of a load curve deﬁning stress scale facto rs vs.  strain rates, 
determined f rom experiments.  An example of the curve can be 
found in Figure M260A-2 .  In addition , strain rates are stored in 
history variable #5 and s train rate scale factors are stored in 
history variable #6.  To turn on the variables for viewing in LS-
PrePost , set NEIPS to at least “6” in *DATA-
BASE_EXTENT_ BINARY.  It is very useful to know what levels of 
strain rates, and strain rate scale factors in a pa rticular simulation.  
Once d3plot  ﬁles are opened in LS-PrePost , individual ele ment 
time history can be plotted via menu option Post → History , or a 
color contour of the entire part can be viewed with  the menu 
option Post  → FriComp  → Misc . *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
AOPT Material axes option (see .   *.   
 The required stress-strain hardening curve must be for uniaxial tension along the 
rolling direction.  Strain rate sensitivity is impl emented as an option, by deﬁning a 
curve (LCIDV) of strain rates vs.  stress scale fac tors, see Figure M260A-2 . 
 
The variable SCALE is very useful in speeding up th e simulation while equalizing the 
strain rate eﬀect.  For example, if the real, physi cal pulling speed is at 15 mm/s but 
running at this speed will take a long time, one co uld increase the pulling speed to 500 
mm/s while setting the SCALE to 0.03, resulting in the same results as those from 15 
mm/s with the beneﬁt of greatly reduced computation al time.  See examples in 
V erification . 
History Variables: 
1.  Damage accumulation: history variable #1 (when the  option Xue is used and 
EOS is not used).    The value ranges from 0.0 to 1 .0. 
2.  Damage accumulation: history variable #5 (when the  option Xue and EOS are 
used).  
3.  Strain rates: history variable #5 (when the option  XUE is not used). 
4.  Strain rate scale factors: history variable #6, (w hen the option XUE is not used). 
Veriﬁcation: 
Uniaxial tension tests were done on a single shell element as shown in Figure M260A-1 .  
Strain rate eﬀect LCIDV is input as shown in Figure M260A-2 .  In Figure M260A-3 , 
pulling stress vs.  strain from various test condit ions are compared with input stress-
strain curve A.  In summary, using the parameter SC ALE, the element can be pulled 
much faster (500 mm/s vs.  15 mm/s) but achieve the  same stress vs.  strain results, the 
same strain rates (history variable #5), and the sa me strain rate scale factor (history 
variable #6 in Figure M260A-4 ).  Simulation speed can be improved further with 
increased mass scaling (−1.0 × |u1D4J1|u1D4612|u1D4JA|u1D46≠)  without aﬀecting the results, see Figure M260A-5 . 
 
A partial keyword input is provided below, for the case with pulling speed of 500 
mm/s, strain hardening curve ID of 100, LCIDV curve  ID of 105, and strain rate scale 
factor of 0.03.
