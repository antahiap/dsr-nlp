2-252 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 and |u1D447|u1D4JACst|u1D4J6Cst|u1D46≠Cst|u1D4J2Cst|u1D46≠Cst ≡|/u1D44B(/u1D̅05|u1D4JBCst) −/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05|u1D4JBCst)|.  This failure envelop surface is ﬁxed in /radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st−/u1D4:D|oneCst space, 
and therefore, does not harden unless kinematic har dening is present.  Next, there is a 
cap surface, denoted |u1D4J3|twoCst in the ﬁgure, with |u1D4J3|twoCst given by 
|u1D4J3|twoCst=/radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st− |u1D439|u1D4J≠Cst(/u1D4:D|oneCst, |u1D43∆) 
where |u1D439|u1D4J≠Cst is deﬁned by 
|u1D439|u1D4J≠Cst(/u1D4:D|oneCst,/u1D̅05)≡1
|u1D44J/radical.v2[/u1D44B(/u1D̅05) −/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05)]|twoCst− [/u1D4:D|oneCst−/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05)]|twoCst, 
/u1D44B(/u1D̅05) is the intersection of the cap surface with the /u1D4:D|oneCst axis 
/u1D44B(/u1D̅05) =/u1D̅05+ |u1D44J|u1D439|u1D4J2Cst(/u1D̅05), 
and /u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) is deﬁned by  
/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05)≡|<raceleftCv4/u1D̅05   if   /u1D̅05> 0
0   if   /u1D̅05≤ 0 
The hardening parameter /u1D̅05 is related to the plastic volume change |u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst|u1D4JDCst through the 
hardening law 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst|u1D4JDCst=/u1D44A/˙raceleft.v11 − exp[−|u1D437(/u1D44B(/u1D̅05) −/u1D44B|zeroCst)]/˙raceright.v1 
Geometrically, /u1D̅05 is seen in the ﬁgure as the /u1D4:D|oneCst coordinate of the intersection of the cap 
surface and the failure surface.  Finally, there is  the tension cutoﬀ surface, denoted |u1D4J3|threeCst in 
the ﬁgure.  The function |u1D4J3|threeCst is given by  
|u1D4J3|threeCst≡|u1D447 −/u1D4:D|oneCst 
where |u1D447 is the input material parameter which speciﬁes the  maximum hydrostatic 
tension sustainable by the material.  The elastic d omain in /radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st−/u1D4:D|oneCst space is then 
bounded by the failure envelope surface above, the tension cutoﬀ surface on the left, 
and the cap surface on the right. 
 
An additive decomposition of the strain into elasti c and plastic parts is assumed: 
/u1D6C6=/u1D6C6|u1D4J2Cst+/u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst , 
where /u1D6C6|u1D4J2Cst is the elastic strain and /u1D6C6|u1D4JDCstis the plastic strain.  Stress is found from the el astic 
strain using Hooke’s law, 
/u1D6D4=/u1D402(/u1D6C6 −/u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst), 
where /u1D6D4 is the stress and /u1D402 is the elastic constitutive tensor. 
 
The yield condition may be written 
|u1D4J3|oneCst(|u1D46≠) ≤ 0
|u1D4J3|twoCst(|u1D46≠,/u1D̅05) ≤ 0
|u1D4J3|threeCst(|u1D46≠) ≤ 0 
and the plastic consistency condition requires that  *.   
2-254 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 surface.  Thus, the shape of the yield surfaces des cribed above remains unchanged, but 
they may translate in a plane orthogonal to the /u1D4:D axis, 
 
Translation of the yield surfaces is permitted thro ugh the introduction of a “back stress” 
tensor, /u1D6C2. The formulation including kinematic hardening is obtained by replacing the 
stress /u1D6D4 with the translated stress tensor |u1D7≠2≡|u1D7≠∆ − |u1D6F+  in all of the above equations.  The 
history tensor /u1D6C2 is assumed deviatoric and therefore has only 5 uni que components.  
The evolution of the back stress tensor is governed  by the nonlinear hardening law 
|u1D6F+ =/u1D450̅|u1D439̅(|u1D7≠∆, |u1D6F+)|u1D4J2̇|u1D4JDCst 
where /u1D450̅ is a constant, |u1D439̅ is a scalar function of /u1D6D4 and /u1D6C2  and |u1D4J2̇|u1D4JDCst is the rate of deviatoric 
plastic strain.  The constant may be estimated from  the slope of the shear stress - plastic 
shear strain curve at low levels of shear stress. 
 
The function |u1D439̅ is deﬁned as 
|u1D439̅≡max |<racketleftCvJ0,1 −(|u1D7≠∆ − |u1D6F+)|u1D6F+
2/u1D441|u1D439|u1D4J2Cst(/u1D4:D|oneCst)|<racketriµhtCvJ  , 
where /u1D441 is a constant deﬁning the size of the yield surfac e.  The value of /u1D441 may be 
interpreted as the radial distant between the outsi de of the initial yield surface and the 
inside of the limit surface.  In order for the limi t surface of the kinematic hardening cap 
model to correspond with the failure envelope surfa ce of the standard cap model, the 
scalar parameter |u1D6F+ must be replaced |u1D6F+ −/u1D441 in the deﬁnition |u1D439|u1D4J2Cst. 
 
The cap model contains a number of parameters which  must be chosen to represent a 
particular material and are generally based on expe rimental data.  The parameters |u1D6F+, |u1D6FD, 
/u1D̅0:, and |u1D6F∆ are usually evaluated by ﬁtting a curve through fa ilure data taken from a set of 
triaxial compression tests.  The parameters /u1D44A, |u1D437, and /u1D44B|zeroCst deﬁne the cap hardening law.  
The value /u1D44A represents the void fraction of the uncompressed s ample and |u1D437 governs 
the slope of the initial loading curve in hydrostat ic compression.  The value of |u1D44J is the 
ratio of major to minor axes of the quarter ellipse  deﬁning the cap surface.  Additional 
details and guidelines for ﬁtting the cap model to experimental data are found in Chen 
and Baladi [1985]. *.  (*MA T_025) that includes
