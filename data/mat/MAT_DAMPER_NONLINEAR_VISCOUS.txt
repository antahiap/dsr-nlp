This is  Material Type 5 for discrete elements (*ELEMENT_DIS CRETE).  This material 
provides a viscous translational damper with an arb itrary force as a function of velocity 
dependency or a rotational damper with an arbitrary  moment as a function of rotational 
velocity dependency.  With the damper located betwe en two nodes, only one degree of 
freedom is connected.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label n ot exceeding 8 
characters must be speciﬁed. 
LCDR Load curve ID deﬁning force as a function of r ate-of- displacement 
relationship or a moment as a function of rate-of- rotation 
relationship.  The load curve must  deﬁne the response in the 
negative and positive quadrants and pass through po int (0,0). 
Remarks: 
Rotational displacement is measured in radians. *
