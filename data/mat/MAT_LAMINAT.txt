LCDFAIL Load-Curve ID, that deﬁnes orientation dependent failure strains.  
The ordinate values in the load- curve deﬁne the various failure

1.  EF_11T: tensile failure strain in longitudinal |u1D44∆-direction 
2.  EF_11C: compressive failure strain in longitudinal  |u1D44∆-
direction 
3.  EF_22T: tensile failure strain in transverse |u1D44F-direction

9.  EF_31: out-of plane shear failure strain in /u1D450|u1D44∆ -plane 
 
Thus, the load- curve to deﬁne these values has to have either 5

deﬁnition with 9 entries may be used for shells, ig noring the last 4

2-434 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 identical to the strength, which is similar to idea l elastoplastic behavior.  For 
tensile failure a small value for SLIMT x is often reasonable; however, for com- 
pression SLIMC x = 1.0 is preferred.  This is also valid for the corr esponding 
shear value. 
If SLIM xx  is smaller than 1.0, then localization can be obse rved depending on 
the total behavior of the lay-up.  If the user is i ntentionally using SLIM xx  < 1.0, 
it is generally recommended to avoid a drop to zero  and set the value to some- 
thing in between 0.05 and 0.10. Then elastoplastic behavior is achieved in the 
limit which often leads to less numerical problems.   The defaults for SLIM xx  
are 10 -8. 
3.  Crashfront.   The crashfront-algorithm is started if and only i f a value for 
TSIZE is input.  Note that time step size, with ele ment elimination after the 
actual time step becomes smaller than TSIZE. 
4.  Damage.  The damage parameters can be written to the post pr ocessing 
database for each integration point as the ﬁrst thr ee additional element varia- 
bles and can be visualized. 
Material models with FS = 1 or FS = -1 are better f or complete laminates and 
fabrics, as all directions are treated in a similar  fashion. 
For material model FS = 1 an interaction between no rmal stresses and the shear 
stresses is assumed for the evolution of damage in the |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F-directions.  The /u1D̅0F

2.  Rate Effects.   Rate eﬀects are taken into account through a Maxw ell model 
using linear viscoelasticity by a convolution integ ral of the form:

where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst(|u1D461Cst−/u1D̅0F.st) is the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent stres s measures.  
This stress is added to the stress tensor determine d from the strain energy 
functional.  Since we wish to include only simple r ate eﬀects, the relaxation 
function is represented by six terms from the Prony  series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
We characterize this in the input by the shear modu li, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and decay constants, 
|u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.  An arbitrary number of terms, not exceeding 6, m ay be used when apply- 
ing the viscoelastic model.  The composite failure is not directly aﬀected by the 
presence of the viscous stress tensor. *. ED_FRACTURE_DAIMLER_PINHO  *. ED_FRACTURE_DAIMLER_PINHO

 3.  Nonlinear In-Plane Shear.   To account for the characteristic nonlinear in-
plane shear behavior of laminated ﬁber-reinforced c omposites, a 1D elasto-
plastic formulation is coupled to a linear damage b ehavior once the maximum 
allowable stress state for shear failure is reached .  The non-linearity of the 
shear behavior can be introduced using the deﬁnitio n of an explicit shear stress 
as a function of engineering shear strain curve (LC SS) with *DEFINE_CURVE.  
See Figure M261-3  (in which /u1D̅16|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst  designates engineering shear strain rather than 
tensorial shear strain). 
4.  Element Deletion.   When failure has occurred in all the composite la yers 
(through-thickness integration points), the element  is deleted.  Elements that 
share nodes with the deleted element become “crashf ront” elements and can 
have their strengths reduced by using the SOFT para meter.  An earlier initia- 
tion of crashfront elements is possible by using th e parameter PFL. 
5.  History Variables.   The number of additional integration point variab les 
written to the LS-DYNA database is input by the *DA TABASE_EXTENT_BI-
NARY deﬁnition with the variable NEIPS (shells) and  NEIPH (solids).  These 
additional variables are tabulated below ( i = integration point).    
When intending to initialize the stress state using  *INTIAL_STRESS_ OPTION , 
the stress values SIGXX, SIGYY, etc.  in *INITIAL_S TRESS_ OPTION  are not 
used, rather stresses are determined from the total  strain history variables 31 to 
36.

Once the stress state reaches the failure criterion , a set of scalar damage variables 
(|u1D4J1|oneCst−, |u1D4J1|oneCst+,  |u1D4J1|twoCst−, |u1D4J1|twoCst+, |u1D4J1|sixCst) is introduced associated with the diﬀerent failur e mechanisms.  
A bi-linear (longitudinal direction) and a linear ( transverse direction) damage evolution 
law is used to deﬁne the development of the damage variables driven by the fracture 
toughness and a characteristic internal element len gth to account for objectivity.  See 
Figure M262-2 . 
To account for the characteristic non-linear in-pla ne shear behavior of laminated ﬁber-
reinforced composites a 1D elasto-plastic formulati on with linear hardening is coupled 
to a linear damage behavior once the maximum allowa ble stress state for shear failure is 
reached.  See Figure M262-3 . 
More detailed information about this material model  can be found in Maimí, Camanho, 
Mayugo and Dávila [2007].  
When failure has occurred in all the composite laye rs (through-thickness integration 
points), the element is deleted.  Elements which sh are nodes with the deleted element Damage evolution:
