 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number or label m ust be 
speciﬁed (see *PART). 
RO Mass density 
E Young’s modulus 
PR Poisson’s ratio 
FAIL Failure ﬂag: 
LT.0.0: User deﬁned failure subroutine, matusr_24  in 
dyn21.F , is called to determine failure 
EQ.0.0: Failure is not considered.  This option is recommen ded 
if failure is not of interest since many calculatio ns will 
be saved. 
GT.0.0: Eﬀective plastic strain to failure.  When the plast ic 
strain reaches this value, the element is deleted f ro m 
the calculation. 
TDEL Minimum time step size for automatic element d eletion 
LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID 
Load Curve.   When LC SS is a load curve ID, it is taken as 
deﬁning stress as a function of eﬀective plastic st rain.  If deﬁned, 
EPS1 - EPS8 and ES1 - ES8 are ignored.  
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the stress as a function eﬀect ive plastic strain 
for that rate; see Figure M24-1 .  When the strain rate falls below 
the minimum value, the stress as a function of eﬀec tive plastic 
strain curve for the lowest value of strain rate is  used.  Likewise, 
when the strain rate exceeds the maximum value the stress as a 
function of eﬀective pl astic strain curve for the highest value of *.   
 Remarks: 
If the 3D or 4D table is used for LCSS, interpolati on is used to ﬁnd the corresponding 
stress value for the current plastic strain, strain  rate, and history variable(s).  In 
addition, extrapolation is used for the history var iable evaluation, which means that 
some upper and lower “limit curves” have to be used , if extrapolation is not desired. 
 
If material history is written to the dynain  ﬁle using *INTERFACE_SPRINGBACK_LS-
DYNA, the history variables of *.  is used  in combination with *
