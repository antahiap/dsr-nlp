FAIL Failure ﬂag: 
LT.0.0: User deﬁned failure subroutine, matusr_24  in 
dyn21.F , is called to determine failure. 
EQ.0.0: Failure is not considered.  This option is recommen ded 
if fail ure is not of interest since many calculations will  
be saved. 
GT.0.0: Plastic strain to failure.  When the plastic strain  reaches 
this value, the element is deleted from the calcula tion. 
TDEL Minimum time step size for automatic deletion of shell elements

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
PC Compressive mean stress (pressure) at which the yie ld stress 
follows load curve ID, LCIDC.  If the pressure fall s between PC 
and PT, a weighted average of the two load curves i s used.  Both 
PC and PT should be entered as positive values. 
PT Tensile mean s tress at which the yield stress follows load curve 
ID, LCIDT 
PCUTC Pressure cut- oﬀ in compression (PCUTC must be greater than or 
equal to zero).  PCUTC (and PCUTT) apply only to el ement types 
that use a 3D stress update, such as solids, tshell  formulatio ns 3 
and 5, and SPH.  When the pressure cut- oﬀ is reached the 
deviatoric stress tensor is set to zero and the pre ssure remains at 
its compressive value.  Like the yield stress, PCUT C is scaled to 
account for rate eﬀects. 
PCUTT Pressure cut-oﬀ in tensio n (PCUTT must be less than or equal to 
zero).  When the pressure cut- oﬀ is reached, the deviatoric stress 
tensor and tensile pressure is set to zero.  Like t he yield stress, 
PCUTT is scaled to account for rate eﬀects. 
PCUTF Pressure cut-oﬀ ﬂag activation: 
EQ.0.0: Inactive 
EQ.1.0: Active 
SRFILT Strain rate ﬁltering parameter in exponential movin g average 
with admissible values ranging from 0 to 1 (availab le for LC-
SRC ≠ 0 or LCSRT ≠ 0 with SRFLAG = 0 or 1): 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCstavg =SRFILT ×|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst−|oneCstavg +(1−SRFILT )×|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst

 plied that PC is a compressive mean stress value an d PT is tensile mean stress 
value. 
Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper a nd Symonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor: 
1 +|<racketleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|<racketriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  . 
If SRFLAG = 0, |u1D7≠≠̇ is the total strain rate, 
|u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
2.  LCFAIL.   The LCFAIL ﬁeld is only applicable when at least one of the 
following four conditions are met: 
a)  SRFLAG = 2 
b)  LCSRC is nonzero 
c)  LCSRT is nonzero 
d)  Gi and BETA i values are provided. *
