This is  Material Type 188.  In this model, creep is describ ed separately from plasticity 
using Garafalo’s steady-state hyperbolic sine creep  law or Norton’s power law.  Viscous 
eﬀects of plastic strain rate are considered using the Cowper-Symonds model.  Young’s 
modulus, Poisson’s ratio, thermal expansion coeﬃcie nt, yield stress, material 
parameters of Cowper-Symonds model as well as the i sotropic and kinematic 
hardening parameters are all assumed to be temperat ure dependent.  Application scope 
includes: simulation of solder joints in electronic  packaging, modeling of tube brazing 
process, creep age forming, etc.

LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID. The load curve deﬁnes eﬀ ective stress 
as a function of eﬀective plastic strain.  The tabl e deﬁnes for each 
temperature value a load curve ID referencing stres s as a function 
of eﬀective plastic strain for that temperature.  The stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain curve for the l owest value of 
temperature is used if the temperature falls below the minimum 
value.  Likewise, the stress as a function of eﬀect ive plastic strain 
curve for the highest value of temperat ure is used if the 
temperature exceeds the maximum value.  Card 2 is ignored with 
this option.

 where /u1D6D⃡|u1D4J2Cst is the elastic deviatoric stress tensor.  Similarl y, the plastic and thermal strain

where |u1D6F+ is the thermal expansion coeﬃcient (note the deﬁni tion compared to that of

The plasticity is isotropic or kinematic but with a  von Mises yield criterion, the 
subscript in the equation above indicates the simul ation time of evaluation.  Internally, 
this stress update requires the solution of a nonli near equation in the eﬀective stress, the 
viscoelastic strain increment and potentially the p lastic strain increment.
