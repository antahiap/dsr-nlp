LS-DYNA R13 2-285 (MAT) VARIABLE DESCRIPTION 
EFG Plastic strain at failure for glass 
EP Young’s modulus for polymer 
PRP Poisson’s ratio for polymer 
SYP Yield stress for polymer 
ETP Plastic hardening modulus for polymer 
F1, …, FN Integration point material: 
EQ.0.0:  glass (default) 
EQ.1.0:  polymer 
A user-deﬁned integration rule must be speciﬁed; se e *INTEGRA-
TION_SHELL.  See Remarks below. 
Remarks: 
Isotropic hardening for both materials is assumed.  The material to which the glass is 
bonded is assumed to stretch plastically without fa ilure.  A user deﬁned integration rule 
speciﬁes the thickness of the layers making up the glass.  F i deﬁnes whether the 
integration point is glass (0.0) or polymer (1.0).  The material deﬁnition, F i, must be 
given for the same number of integration points (NI PTS) as speciﬁed in the rule.  A 
maximum of 32 layers is allowed. 
If the recommended user deﬁned rule is not deﬁned, the default integration rules are 
used.  The location of the integration points in th e default rules are deﬁned in the *SEC-
TION_SHELL keyword description. *
