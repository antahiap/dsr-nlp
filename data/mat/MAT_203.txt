A1, A2, A3 Components of vector /u1D41A for AOPT = 2 (see MAT 2 ) 
V1, V2, V3 Components of vector /u1D42F for AOPT = 3 and 4 (see MAT 2 ) 
D1, D2, D3 Components of vector /u1D41D for AOPT = 2 (see MAT 2 ) 
BETA Angle for AOPT = 3 (see MAT 2 ) 
Remarks: 
Reinforcement is treated as bars, acting independen tly in the local material |u1D46J and |u1D466 
directions.  By default, the local material |u1D46J-axis is the element |u1D46J-axis (parallel to the line 
from Node 1 to Node 2), but this may be overridden using AOPT or Element Beta 
angles.  
 
For shell elements, the reinforced concrete section  should be deﬁned using *PART_-
COMPOSITE with some integration points being reinfo rcement (referencing a Material 
ID using this material model) and others being conc rete (using for example *.   *MAY_HYSTERETIC_REINFORCEMENT

|u1D4JF, 
Where, /u1D458 depends on end conditions, and 
/u1D4:F= unsupported length of reinforcement b ars 
|u1D4JF = radius of gyration which for round b ars is e q ual to ( b ar radius)/2. 
It is expected that users will determine LAMDA acco unting for the expected crack 
spacing. 
 
The alternative buckling behaviour deﬁned by EBU an d DOWNSL is shown below. 
 
 
Reloading after change of load direction follows a Bauschinger-type curve, leading to

The input parameters should be given in model units , e.g. DBAR and LCHAR are in 
model length units, FCDOW is in model stress units.   These will be converted internally 
using UNITL and UNITC.  
Element erosion: 
By default, no erosion occurs.  Elements will be de leted only if EPDAM1 and EPDAM2 
are non-zero, and DRESID is zero, and the accumulat ed plastic strain reaches EPDAM2. 
If FRACX and FRACY are both non-zero, i.e. if there  is reinforcement in both local 
directions, then elements are eroded only when the condition above has been reached in 
both local directions. 
Output: 
The output stresses, as for all other LS-DYNA mater ial models, are by default in the 
global coordinate system.  They are scaled by the r einforcement fractions FRACX, FRA-
CY. The plastic strain output is the accumulated pl astic strain (increments always 
treated as positive), and is the greater such value  of the two local directions.  Extra 
history variables are available as follows: 
 
Extra variable 1:  Reinforcement stress in local |u1D46J direction (not scaled by FRACX) 
Extra variable 2:  Reinforcement stress in local |u1D466 direction (not scaled by FRACY) 
Extra variable 3:  Total strain in local |u1D46J direction 
Extra variable 4:  Total strain in local |u1D466 direction 
Extra variable 5:  Accumulated plastic strain in lo cal |u1D46J direction 
Extra variable 6:  Accumulated plastic strain in lo cal |u1D466 direction 
Extra variable 7:  Shear stress (dowel action) in l ocal |u1D46J|u1D466  
Extra variable 8:  Shear stress (dowel action) in l ocal |u1D46J /u1D46̅
