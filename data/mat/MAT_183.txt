  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
AVGOPT Averaging option determine strain rate to reduce nu merical 
noise. 
EQ.0.0:  simple average of twelve time steps, 
EQ.1.0:  running 12 point average. 
LCUNLD Load curve, see *DEFINE_ CURVE, deﬁning the force versus 
actual change in the gauge length during unloading.   The unload 
curve should cover exactly the same range as LC (or  as the ﬁrst 
curve of table TBID) and its end points should have  identical 
values , i.e., the combination of LC (or as the ﬁrst curve  of table 
TBID) and LCUNLD describes a complete cycle of load ing and 
unloading. 
REF Use reference geometry to initialize the stress ten sor.  The 
reference geometry is deﬁned by the keyword:*INITIA L_FOAM_-
REFERENCE_GEOMETRY (see there for more details). 
EQ.0.0:  oﬀ, 
EQ.1.0:  on. 
STOL Tolerance in stability check, see remark 2 . 
Remarks: 
1.  The LOG_LOG_INTERPOLATION option interpolates the strain rate eﬀect in 
the table TBID using log-log interpolation. 
2.  Bad choice of curves for the stress-strain respons e may lead to an unstable 
model, and there is an option to check this to a ce rtain tolerance level, see di- 
mensionless parameter STOL. The check is done by ex amining the eigenvalues 
of the tangent modulus at selected stretch points a nd a warning message is 
issued if an eigenvalue is less than –STOL × BULK, where BULK indicates the 
bulk modulus of the material.  For STOL < 0 the che ck is disabled, otherwise it 
should be chosen with care, a too small value may d etect instabilities that are 
insigniﬁcant in practice.  To avoid signiﬁcant inst abilities it is recommended to 
use smooth curves, at best the curves should be con tinuously diﬀerentiable, in 
fact for the incompressible case, a suﬃcient condit ion for stability is that the 
stress-stretch curve |u1D446(|u1D7≠6)  can be written as 
|u1D446(|u1D7≠6) =/u1D4:B(|u1D7≠6) −/u1D4:B(1
/radical.v1|u1D7≠6)
