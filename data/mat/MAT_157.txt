discretized to equally space the table values, it ma kes good sense 
from an accuracy standpoint that the table values r epresent the 
natural log of strain rate when the lowest strain r ate and highest 
strain rate diﬀer by several orders of magnitude.  There i s some 
additional computational cost associated with invok ing

Remarks: 
1.  Description of IHIS (Solid Elements).   Several of this material’s parameters 
may be overwritten on an element-by-element basis t hrough history variables 
using the *INITIAL_STRESS_SOLID keyword.  Bitwise ( binary) expansion of 
IHIS determines which material properties are to be  read: 
I H IS = |u1D44∆|fourCst× 16 + |u1D44∆|threeCst×8+ |u1D44∆|twoCst× 4 + |u1D44∆|oneCst× 2 + |u1D44∆|zeroCst, 
where each |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary ﬂag set to either 1 or 0.  The |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst are interpreted accord- 
ing to the following table.

The NHISV ﬁeld on *INITIAL_STRESS_SOLID must be set  equal to the sum of 
the number of variables to be read in, which depend s on IHIS (and the |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst):

Then, in the following order, *INITIAL_STRESS_SOLID  processes the history 
variables, HISV i, as: 
a)  6 material direction parameters when |u1D44∆|zeroCst= 1 
b)  21 anisotropic stiﬀness parameters when |u1D44∆|oneCst= 1 *.   
 The /u1D45E|u1D4J6Cst terms are the material direction cosine and sine f or the rotation from a 
co-rotational element’s system to the |u1D44∆-|u1D44F-/u1D450 material directions.  The /u1D450|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  terms are 
the upper triangular terms of the symmetric stiﬀnes s matrix, /u1D450|oneCst|oneCst , /u1D450|oneCst|twoCst , /u1D450|oneCst|threeCst , /u1D450|oneCst|fourCst ,

for the 3-dimensional case (solid elements) with th ree planes of symmetry with 
respect to the material coordinate system.  The int eraction terms |u1D439|oneCst|twoCst , |u1D439|twoCst|threeCst , and

If these conditions are violated, then the stress t ensor will be reduced to zero 
over NCFAIL time steps and then the element gets er oded.  A small value for 
NCFAIL (< 50) is recommended to avoid unphysical be havior; the default is 
10. The default values for the strengths XT, XC, YT , YC, ZT, ZC, SXY, SYZ, and 
SZX are 10 20 , that is, basically no limits.  The scale factors FF12, FF23, and FF31 
for the interaction terms are zero by default.  
4.  Tsai-Hill failure criterion (EXTRA = 2).   Brittle failure with diﬀerent strengths

 Converting Moldﬂow Results into LS-Dyna Keyword For mat: 
Starting in LS-PrePost 4.6, a feature has been adde d to map Moldﬂow results for short 
ﬁber reinforced composite injection molding to the LS-DYNA keyword format.  This 
feature reads in the results from Moldﬂow, maps the  results to the LS-DYNA mesh, and 
calculates the anisotropic elasticity tensor /u1D450|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  for structure analysis using this keyword 
with *INITIAL_STRESS_SHELL keyword card.  This feat ure can only be used with shell 
LS-DYNA elements.   
 
To convert the Moldﬂow results, the udm  format of the Moldﬂow solid mesh and the 
xml  format of the ﬁber orientation result from the mol ding simulation are required.  
These ﬁles are mapped onto the LS-DYNA shell mesh. 
 
LS-PrePost obtains the spatially varying /u1D450|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  for this keyword using a two-step process.  
First, the elastic properties of the homogenized un idirectional ﬁber reinforced 
composite are calculated from the Young’s modulus a nd the Poisson ratio of the ﬁber 
 Figure M157-1.   Moldﬂow conversion dialog box. *.   
 8.  The Pick Parts  section is used to select which parts of the Moldﬂ ow mesh is 
being mapped to the LS-Dyna parts.  When selecting the From , select the ap- 
propriate Moldﬂow part.  For the To , select the appropriate LS-DYNA part. 
9.  The Pick Segments  provides an orientation for the mapping onto the L S-DYNA 
part.  Just select two diﬀerent sides for Side1  and Side2  of the LS-DYNA part. 
10.  Then select Map  to make the conversion based on the above inputs. 
11.  After mapping.  the results can be output using th e Save *INITIAL to  section 
which saves the results so that they can be used fo r LS-DYNA calculations.
