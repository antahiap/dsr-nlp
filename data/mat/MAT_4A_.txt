This is  Material Type 215. A micromechanical material that distinguishes between a 
ﬁber/inclusion and a matrix material, developed by 4a engineering GmbH. It is 
available for the explicit code for shell, thick sh ell, and solid elements. Useful hints and 
an input example can be found in [ 1]. More theory and application notes are provided 
in [ 2].  
 
This material is intended for anisotropic composite  materials, especially for short 
(SFRT) and long ﬁber thermoplastics (LFRT). The mat rix behavior is modeled with an 
isotropic elasto-viscoplastic von Mises model.  The  ﬁber/inclusion behavior is 
transverse isotropic elastic.  This material model can be used for classical endless ﬁber 
composites. 
 
The inelastic homogenization for describing the com posite deformation behavior is 
based on: 
• Mori Tanaka Meanﬁeld Theory [ 3,4] 
• ellipsoidal inclusions using Eshelby’s solution [ 5,6] 
• orientation averaging [ 7] 
• a linear ﬁtted closure approximation to determine  the 4 th  order ﬁber orientation 
tensor out of the user provided 2 nd  order ﬁber orientation tensor. 
 
The software product 4a micromec can calculate and export the thermo-elastic 
composite properties [ 8]. 
 
Failure/damage of the composite can be considered w ith: 
• a ductile damage initiation and evolution model f or the matrix (DIEM) 
• ﬁber failure with a maximum stress criterion 
References [ 9] and [ 10 ] provide more details on the material characteriza tion. 
The (ﬁber) orientation can be deﬁned either for the  whole material using Cards 2 and 3 
or elementwise using *ELEMENT_(T)SHELL_BETA or *ELEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO. 
The manufacturing process highly inﬂuences the mech anical properties of SFRT and 
LFRT in injection molded parts.  By mapping the ﬁbe r orientation from the process 
simulation to the structural analysis the local ani sotropy can be considered [ 11 ,12 ]. The 
ﬁber orientation, length and volume fraction can th erefore as well be deﬁned for each 
integration point by using *INITIAL_STRESS_(T)SHELL (SOLID) [ 2]. Details on the 
history variables that can be initialized (extra hi story variables 9-18) can be found in the 
output section. *. MICROMEC  
 Card Summary: 
Cards 2 through 4 specify ﬁber orientation.  They m ay be overwritten with may be 
overwritten by *INITIAL_STRESS_(T)SHELL/SOLID. Card s 5 and 6 are for specifying 
parameters for the ﬁber/inclusion material.  Cards 7 through 9 give properties 
associated with the matrix material.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
NUMINT Number or percentage of failed integration points p rior to 
element deletion (default value is 1): 
GT.0.0: Number of integration points which must fail before  
element is deleted.  
LT.0.0: Applies only to shells. |N U MINT|  is the percentage of 
layers which must fail before an element fails.  Fo r shell 
formulations with 4 integration points per layer, t he 
layer is considered failed if any of the integratio n points 
in the layer fails.
