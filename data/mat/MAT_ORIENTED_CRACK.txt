Remarks: 
This is an isotropic elastic-plastic material which  includes a failure model with an 
oriented crack.  The von Mises yield condition is g iven by: 
/u1D̅1∫=/u1D4:D|twoCst−|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst
3  , 
where the second stress invariant, /u1D4:D|twoCst, is deﬁned in terms of the deviatoric stress 
components as 
/u1D4:D|twoCst=1
2|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   , 
and the yield stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst, is a function of the eﬀective plastic strain, |u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst, and the plastic 
hardening modulus, |u1D438|u1D4JDCst: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D438|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst  . 
The eﬀective plastic strain is deﬁned as: 
|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst=/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|u1D461Cst
|zeroCst  , 
where 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst=/radical.v52
3|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JDCst|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JDCst 
and the plastic tangent modulus is deﬁned in terms of the input tangent modulus, |u1D438|u1D461Cst, as 
|u1D438|u1D4JDCst=|u1D438|u1D438|u1D461Cst
|u1D438 − |u1D438|u1D461Cst  . 
Pressure in this model is found from evaluating an equation of state.  A pressure cutoﬀ 
can be deﬁned such that the pressure is not allowed  to fall below the cutoﬀ value. 
 
The oriented crack fracture model is based on a max imum principal stress criterion.  
When the maximum principal stress exceeds the fract ure stress, |u1D7≠∆/u1D45:.st, the element fails on 
a plane perpendicular to the direction of the maxim um principal stress.  The normal 
stress and the two shear stresses on that plane are  then reduced to zero.  This stress 
reduction is done according to a delay function tha t reduces the stresses gradually to 
zero over a small number of time steps.  This delay  function procedure is used to reduce *
