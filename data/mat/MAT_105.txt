value.  Likewise, the stress as a function of eﬀect ive plastic strain 
curve for the highest value of strain rate is used if the strain rate 
exceeds the maximum value.  The strain rate paramet ers, C and P; 
the curve ID, LCSR; EPS1 - EPS8; and ES1 - ES8 are ignored if a 
Table ID is deﬁned.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
EPSD Damage threshold, |u1D4JF/u1D451.st. Damage eﬀective plastic strain when 
material softening begins.   
S Damage material constant |u1D446.  Default = |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst200 ⁄ . 
DC Critical damage value |u1D437/u1D4:6.st. When the damage value |u1D437 reaches this 
value, the element is deleted from the calculation.
