RO Mass density 
K Bulk modulus.  This modulus is used for determining  the contact 
interface stiﬀness. 
N Material constant.  Deﬁne if LCID = 0 below; othe r wise, N is ﬁt 
from the load curve data.  See remarks below. 
MU Damping coeﬃcient (0.05 < recommended value < 0. 50) 
LCID Load curve ID that deﬁnes the force per unit area a s a function of 
the stretch ratio.  This curve can be given for eit her uniaxial or 
biaxial data depending on FITTYPE.  Load curve LC SR below 
must also be deﬁned. 
FITTYPE Type of ﬁt: 
EQ.1:  uniaxial data 
EQ.2:  biaxial data 
LCSR Load curve ID that deﬁnes the uniaxial or biaxial s tress ratio (see 
FITTYPE) as a function of the transverse stretch ra tio

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCVE Optional load curve ID that deﬁnes the relaxation f unction in 
shear.  This curve is used to ﬁt the coeﬃcients G i and BETA i (see 
Card 5).  If zero, deﬁne the coeﬃcients directly (r ecommended).   
NT Number of terms used to ﬁt the Prony series, whi ch must be less 
than or equal to 12.  This number should be equal t o the number 
of decades of time covered by the experimental data .  Deﬁne this 
number if LCVE is nonzero.  Carefully check the ﬁt in the d3hsp 
ﬁle to ensure that it is valid, since the least squ are ﬁt is not always *.   
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
Gi Optional shear relaxation modulus for the ith  term 
BETA i Optional decay constant if ith  term 
Remarks: 
If load curve data is deﬁned, the ﬁt generated by L S-DYNA must be closely checked in 
the d3hsp  output ﬁle.  It may occur that the nonlinear least  squares procedure in LS-
DYNA, which is used to ﬁt the data, is inadequate. 
 
The Hill strain energy density function for this hi ghly compressible foam is given by:

|u1D4J7Cst=|oneCst  , 
where |u1D436|u1D4J7Cst, |u1D44F|u1D4J7Cst, and |u1D4JB are material constants and /u1D4:D= |u1D7≠6|oneCst|u1D7≠6|twoCst|u1D7≠6|threeCst represents the ratio of the 
deformed to the undeformed state.  The principal Ca uchy stresses are

From the above equations the shear modulus is:

and the bulk modulus is: 
|u1D43∆ = 2|u1D7≠7 |parenleftCvJ|u1D4JB +1

The value for |u1D43∆ deﬁned in the input is used in the calculation of contact forces and for 
the material time step.  Generally, this value shou ld be equal to or greater than the |u1D43∆ 
given in the above equation.
