  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
FAILSM Stretch ratio for surrounding matrix materia l at failure ( applies 
to shell elements only).  If zero, failure is not c onsidered. 
FAILSHR Shear strain at failure at a material point  (applies to shell 
elements only).  If zero, failure is not considered .  This failure 
value is independent of FAILSF and FAILSM. 
AOPT Material axes option, see Figure M2-1  (bricks only): 
EQ.0.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined 
by element nodes as shown in Figure M2-1 .  Nodes 
1, 2, and 4 of an element are identical to the node s 
used for the deﬁnition of a coordinate system as by  
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_NODES. 
EQ.1.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined 
by a point in space and the global location of the el- 
ement center; this is the |u1D44∆-direction.  This option is 
for solid elements only. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined 
by vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COOR-
DINATE_VECTOR. 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes dete rmined by a 
line in the plane of the element deﬁned by the cros s 
product of the vector /u1D42F with the element normal.  
The plane of a solid element is the midsurface be- 
tween the inner surface and outer surface deﬁned by  
the ﬁrst four nodes and the last fou r nodes of the 
connectivity of the element, respectively. 
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D4JD, which deﬁne the centerline 
axis.  This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system 
ID number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_-
NODES, *DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYS TEM or 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_VEC TOR).  Available in 
R3 version of 971 and later.

Coeﬃcients |u1D436|threeCst, |u1D436|fourCst, and |u1D436|fiveCst must be deﬁned by the user.  |u1D436|sixCst is determined by LS-DYNA 
to ensure stress continuity at |u1D7≠6 = |u1D7≠6∗.  Sample values for the material coeﬃcients |u1D436|oneCst− |u1D436|fiveCst 
and |u1D7≠6∗ for ligament tissue can be found in Quapp and Weis s [1998].  The bulk modulus 
|u1D43∆ should be at least 3 orders of magnitude larger th an |u1D436|oneCst to ensure near-incompressible 
material behavior. 
 
Viscoelasticity is included through a convolution i ntegral representation for the time-
dependent second Piola-Kirchoﬀ stress /u1D412(/u1D402, |u1D461):

Here, /u1D412|u1D4J2Cst is the elastic part of the second Piola-Kirchoﬀ st ress as derived from the strain 
energy, and |u1D43A(|u1D461 − |u1D46≠)  is the reduced relaxation function, represented by  a Prony series: 
|u1D43A(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D446|u1D4J6Cstexp |parenleftCvJ|u1D461

Puso and Weiss [1998] describe a graphical method t o ﬁt the Prony series coeﬃcients to 
relaxation data that approximates the behavior of t he continuous relaxation function 
proposed by Y-C. Fung, as quasilinear viscoelastici ty. 
Remarks: 
Cards 1 through 4 must be included for both shell a nd brick elements, although for 
shells cards 3 and 4 are ignored and may be blank l ines. 
 
For shell elements, the ﬁber direction lies in the plane of the element.  The local axis is 
deﬁned by a vector between nodes n1 and n2, and the  ﬁber direction may be oﬀset from 
this axis by an angle FANG. 
 
For brick elements, the local coordinate system is deﬁned using the convention 
described previously for *.   *
