  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
RKS Rotational stiﬀness about the local |u1D46≠-axis  
LT.0.0: |RKS|  is the load curve ID deﬁning the elastic rotational 
moment along the local |u1D46≠-axis as a function of relative 
rotational displacement.  Useful for nonlinear elas tic 
behavior.

LT.0.0: |RKT|  is the load curve ID deﬁning the e lastic rotational 
moment along the local |u1D461-axis as a function of relative 
rotational displacement.  Useful for nonlinear elas tic 
behavior.
