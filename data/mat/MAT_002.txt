the midsurface between the inner su rface and outer

Thus, for solid elements, AOPT = 3 is only available for 
hexahedrons. /u1D41A is determined by taking the cross 
product of /u1D42F with the normal vector, /u1D41B is determined 
by taking the cross product of the normal vector wi th /u1D41A, 
and /u1D41C is the normal vector.  Then /u1D41A and /u1D41B are rotated 
about /u1D41C by an angle BETA. BE TA may be set in the 
keyword input for the element or in the input for t h is

be switched depending on the choice of MACF. The 
switch may occur before or after applying BETA de-

G Shear modulus for frequency independent damping.  F requency 
independent damping is based on a spring and slider  in series.  
The critical stress for the slider mechanism is SIG F.  For the best

SIGF.  This option applies only to solid elements.

Material Directions: 
We will give an overview of how LS-DYNA ﬁnds the pr incipal material directions for 
solid and shell elements for this material and othe r anisotropic materials based on the 
input.  We will call the material coordinate system  the {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} coordinate system.  The 
AOPT options illustrated in Figure M2-1  deﬁne the preliminary {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} system for all 
elements of the parts that use the material, but th is is not the ﬁnal material direction.  
The {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} system deﬁned by the AOPT options may be oﬀset by a ﬁnal rotation about 
the /u1D41C-axis.  The oﬀset angle we call BETA. Note that *EL EMENT_SOLID_ORTHO and 
*ELEMENT_SHELL_MCID allow you to set the preliminar y {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} coordinate system 
for individual solid and shell elements, instead of  using the preliminary system created 
with AOPT. Figures M2-2  and M2-3  give the ﬂow chart for ﬁnding the ﬁnal material 
direction based on the input to the *MAT keyword an d the *ELEMENT keyword.  As 
indicated in the ﬁgures, the orientation of the ﬁna l material axes is updated 
continuously through the simulation as the element moves and deforms, in accordance 
with the invariant numbering scheme (INN in *CONTRO L_ACCURACY). 
 
For solid elements, the BETA angle is speciﬁed in o ne of two ways.  When using 
AOPT = 3, the BETA parameter deﬁnes the oﬀset angle  for all elements that use the 
material.  The BETA parameter on *MAT has no meanin g for the other AOPT options.  
Alternatively, a BETA angle can be deﬁned for indiv idual solid elements as described in 
Remark 5 for *ELEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO.  The BETA angle set using the ORTHO 
option is available for all values of AOPT, and it overrides the BETA angle on the *MAT 
card for AOPT = 3 (see Figure M2-2 ). Note that when the BETA angle is applied in 
either case depends on the value of MACF (if availa ble) of the *MAT keyword.  With 
MACF two of the material directions may be switched .  
 
There are two fundamental diﬀerences between shell and solid element orthotropic 
materials.  (In the following discussion, tshell el ements fall into the “shell” category.)  
First, the /u1D41C-direction is always normal to a shell element such  that the /u1D41A and /u1D41B-directions 
are within the plane of the element.  Second, for s ome anisotropic materials, shell 
elements may have unique ﬁber directions within eac h layer through the thickness of 
the element so that a layered composite can be mode led with a single element.
