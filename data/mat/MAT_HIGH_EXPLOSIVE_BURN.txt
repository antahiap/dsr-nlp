This is  Material Type 8.  It allows the modeling of the det onation of a high explosive.  In 
addition, an equation of state must be deﬁned.  See  Wilkins [1969] and Giroux [1973].

Remarks: 
Burn fractions, |u1D439, which multiply the equations of states for high e xplosives, control the 
release of chemical energy for simulating detonatio ns.  At any time, the pressure in a 
high explosive element is given by: 
|u1D4JD = |u1D439|u1D4JDeos (|u1D449, |u1D438) , 
where |u1D4JDeos  is the pressure from the equation of state (either  types 2, 3, or 14), |u1D449 is the 
relative volume, and |u1D438 is the internal energy density per unit initial vo lume.

2-164 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 In the initialization phase, a lighting time, |u1D461|u1D4J9Cst, is computed for each element by dividing 
the distance from the detonation point to the cente r of the element by the detonation 
velocity, |u1D437.  If multiple detonation points are deﬁned, the cl osest detonation point 
determines t l.  The burn fraction |u1D439 is taken as the maximum, 
|u1D439 = max(|u1D439|oneCst, |u1D439|twoCst)  ,

1 − |u1D449/u1D4:6.st/u1D4:D.st 
where |u1D449/u1D4:6.st/u1D4:D.st is the Chapman-Jouguet relative volume and |u1D461 is current time.  If |u1D439 exceeds 1, 
it is reset to 1.  This calculation of the burn fra ction usually requires several time steps 
for |u1D439 to reach unity, thereby spreading the burn front o ver several elements.  After 
reaching unity, |u1D439 is held constant.  This burn fraction calculation is based on work by 
Wilkins [1964] and is also discussed by Giroux [197 3]. 
 
If the beta burn option is used, BETA = 1.0, any vo lumetric compression will cause 
detonation and  
|u1D439 = |u1D439|twoCst  . 
|u1D439|oneCst is not computed. BETA  =  1 does not allow for the  initialization of the lighting time. 
 
If the programmed burn is used, BETA = 2.0, the und etonated high explosive material 
will behave as an elastic perfectly plastic materia l if the bulk modulus, shear modulus, 
and yield stress are deﬁned.  Therefore, with this option the explosive material can 
compress without causing detonation.  The location and time of detonation is controlled 
by *INITIAL_DETONATION. 
 
As an option, the high explosive material can behav e as an elastic perfectly-plastic solid 
prior to detonation.  In this case we update the st ress tensor, to an elastic trial stress, ∗
