LS-DYNA R13 1-1 (EOS) *EOS  
 
When deﬁning an equation of state, the type of equa tion of state is speciﬁed by a 
corresponding 3-digit number in the command name, e .g., *EOS_004, or equivalently, 
by it’s more descriptive designation, e.g., *EOS_GR UNEISEN.  The equations of state 
can be used with a subset of the materials that are  available for solid elements; see the 
MATERIAL MODEL REFERENCE TABLES in the beginning of  the *MAT section of 
this Manual.   *EOS_015 is linked to the type 2 thi ck shell element and can be used to 
model engine gaskets. 
 
The meaning associated with particular extra histor y variables for a subset of material 
models and equations of state are  tabulated at http://www.dynasupport.com/howtos-
/material/history-variables .  The ﬁrst three extra history variables when usin g an 
equation of state are (1) internal energy, (2) pres sure due to bulk viscosity, and (3) the 
element volume from the previous time step.

An additional option TITLE may be appended to all the *EOS keywords.  If this option 
is used then an additional line is read for each se ction in 80a format which can be used 
to describe the equation of state.  At present LS-D YNA does not make use of the title.  
Inclusion of title simply gives greater clarity to input decks.  
Deﬁnitions and Conventions 
In order to prescribe the boundary and/or initial t hermodynamic condition, manual 
computations are often necessary.  Conventions or d eﬁnitions must be established to 
simplify this process.  Some basic variables are de ﬁned in the following.  Since many of 
these variables have already been denoted by diﬀere nt symbols, the notations used here 
are unique in this section only!  They are presente d to only clarify their usage.  A 
corresponding SI unit set is also presented as an e xample. 
First consider a few volumetric parameters since th ey are a measure of compression (or 
expansion). 
Volume: 
|u1D449 ≈ (m|threeCst) 
Mass: 
|u1D44≠ ≈ (Kg) 
Current speciﬁc volume (per mass): 
|u1D71≠ =|u1D449
|u1D44≠=1
|u1D7≠+≈ |parenleftCv6|u1D4JA|threeCst
Kg |parenriµhtCv6 
Reference speciﬁc volume: 
|u1D71≠|zeroCst=|u1D449|zeroCst
|u1D44≠=1
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst≈ |parenleftCv6|u1D4JA|threeCst
Kg |parenriµhtCv6 
Relative volume: 
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst=|u1D449
|u1D449|zeroCst=(|u1D449 |u1D44≠ ⁄ )
(|u1D449|zeroCst|u1D44≠ ⁄ )=|u1D71≠
|u1D71≠|zeroCst=|u1D7≠+|zeroCst
|u1D7≠+ 
Current normalized volume increment:  *EOS 
LS-DYNA R13 1-3 (EOS) |u1D4J1|u1D71≠ 
|u1D71≠=|u1D71≠ − |u1D71≠|zeroCst
|u1D71≠= 1 −1
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst= 1 −|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst 
A frequently used volumetric parameter is: 
|u1D7≠7 =1
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst− 1 =|u1D71≠|zeroCst− |u1D71≠
|u1D71≠= −|u1D4J1|u1D71≠ 
|u1D71≠=|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst− 1 
Sometimes another volumetric parameter is used: 
|u1D7≠2 =|u1D71≠|zeroCst
|u1D71≠=|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst 
Thus, the relation between |u1D7≠7 and |u1D7≠2  is, 
|u1D7≠7 =|u1D71≠|zeroCst− |u1D71≠
|u1D71≠= |u1D7≠2 − 1 
The following table summarizes these volumetric par ameters. 
VARIABLES COMPRESSION NO LOAD EXPANSION 
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst=|u1D71≠
|u1D71≠|zeroCst=|u1D7≠+|zeroCst
|u1D7≠+ < 1 1 > 1 
|u1D7≠2=1
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst=|u1D71≠|zeroCst
|u1D71≠=|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst > 1 1 < 1 
|u1D7≠7=1
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst−1=|u1D7≠2−1 > 0 0 < 0 
V0 – Initial Relative Volume 
There are 3 deﬁnitions of density that must be dist inguished from each other: 
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst= |u1D7≠+ref  
= Density at nominal reference ⁄ state, usually non-stre ss or non-deformed state. 
|u1D7≠+|dividesCv1|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst= Density at time 0 
|u1D7≠+ = Current density 
 
Recalling the current relative volume 
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst=|u1D7≠+|zeroCst
|u1D7≠+=|u1D71≠
|u1D71≠|zeroCst, 
at time = 0 the relative volume is 
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst= |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst=|u1D7≠+|zeroCst
|u1D7≠+|dividesCv1|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst=|u1D71≠||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst
|u1D71≠|zeroCst. *EOS   
1-4 (EOS) LS-DYNA R13 Generally, the V0 input parameter in an *EOS card r efers to this |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst.  |u1D7≠+|zeroCst is generally the 
density deﬁned in the *MAT card.  Hence, if a mater ial is mechanically compressed at 
t = 0, V0, or |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst, the initial relative volume, may be computed and i nput accordingly 
(|u1D71≠|zeroCst≠ |u1D4490 ). 
 
The “reference” state is a unique state with respec t to which the material stress tensor is 
computed.  Therefore |u1D71≠|zeroCst is very critical in computing the pressure level i n a material.  
Incorrect choice of |u1D71≠|zeroCst would lead to incorrect pressure computed.  In gen eral, |u1D71≠|zeroCst is 
chosen such that at zero compression or expansion, the material should be in 
equilibrium with its ambient surrounding.  In many of the equations shown in the EOS 
section, |u1D7≠7 is frequently used as a measure of compression (or  expansion).  However, the 
users must clearly distinguish between |u1D7≠7 and |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst. 
E0 – Internal Energy 
Internal energy represents the thermal energy state  (temperature dependent 
component) of a system.  One deﬁnition for internal  energy is 
|u1D438 = |u1D44≠|u1D436|u1D463Cst|u1D447 ≈ (Joule) 
Note that the capital “ |u1D438” here is the absolute internal energy.  It is not the same as that 
used in the subsequent *EOS keyword input, or some equations shown for each *EOS 
card.  This internal energy is often deﬁned with re spect to a mass or volume unit. 
 
Internal energy per unit mass (also called speciﬁc internal energy): 
|u1D4J2 =|u1D438
|u1D44≠= |u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D447 ≈ |parenleftCvJJoule 
Kg |parenriµhtCvJ 
Internal energy per unit current volume:  
|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst=|u1D44≠
|u1D449|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D447 = |u1D7≠+|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D447 =|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D447
|u1D71≠≈ |parenleftCvJJoule 
m3=N
m2|parenriµhtCvJ 
Internal energy per unit reference volume: 
|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts=|u1D44≠
|u1D449|zeroCst|u1D436|u1D463Cst|u1D447 = |u1D7≠+|zeroCst|u1D436|u1D463Cst|u1D447 =|u1D436|u1D463Cst|u1D447
|u1D71≠|zeroCst≈ |parenleftCvJJoule 
m3=N
m2|parenriµhtCvJ 
|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts typically refers to the capital “E” shown in some equations under this “EOS” 
section.  Hence the initial “ internal energy per unit reference volume ”, E0, a keyword input 
parameter in the *EOS section can be computed from 
|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts|dividesCv2|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst= |u1D7≠+|zeroCst|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D447||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst 
To convert from |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCst to |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst, simply divide |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCst by |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst 
|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst= |u1D7≠+|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D447 = |<racketleftCv1|u1D7≠+|zeroCst|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D447|<racketriµhtCv1|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst=|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst  *EOS 
LS-DYNA R13 1-5 (EOS) Equations of States (EOS) 
A thermodynamic state of a homogeneous material, no t undergoing any chemical 
reactions or phase changes, may be deﬁned by two st ate variables.  This relation is 
generally called an equation of state.  For example , a few possible forms relating 
pressure to two other state variables are 
|u1D443 = |u1D443(|u1D7≠+, |u1D447) = |u1D443(|u1D71≠, |u1D4J2) = |u1D443(|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst, |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst) = |u1D443(|u1D7≠7, |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts) 
The last equation form is frequently used to comput e pressure.  The EOS for solid phase 
materials is sometimes partitioned into 2 terms, a cold pressure and a thermal pressure  
|u1D443 = |u1D443|u1D4J≠Cst(|u1D7≠7) + |u1D443|u1D447Cst(|u1D7≠7, |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts) 
|u1D443|u1D4J≠Cst(|u1D7≠7) is the cold pressure hypothetically evaluated alon g a 0-degree-Kelvin isotherm.  
This is sometimes called a 0-K pressure-volume rela tion or cold compression curve.  
|u1D443|u1D447Cst(|u1D7≠7, |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts) is the thermal pressure component that depends on both volumetric 
compression and thermal state of the material.  
 
Diﬀerent forms of the EOS describe diﬀerent types o f materials and how their 
volumetric compression (or expansion) behaviors.  T he coeﬃcients for each EOS model 
come from data-ﬁtting, phenomenological description s, or derivations based on 
classical thermodynamics, etc.  
Linear Compression 
In low pressure processes, pressure is not signiﬁca ntly aﬀected by temperature.  When 
volumetric compression is within an elastic linear deformation range, a linear bulk 
modulus may be used to relate volume changes to pre ssure changes.  Recalling the 
deﬁnition of an isotropic bulk modulus is [Fung 196 5], 
∆|u1D71≠
|u1D71≠= −|u1D443
|u1D43∆. 
This may be rewritten as 
|u1D443 = |u1D43∆ |<racketleftCvJ−∆|u1D71≠
|u1D71≠|<racketriµhtCvJ= |u1D43∆|u1D7≠7. 
The bulk modulus, |u1D43∆, thus is equivalent to |u1D436|oneCst in *EOS_LINEAR_POLYNOMIAL when 
all other coeﬃcients are zero.  This is a simplest form of an EOS.  To initialize a pressure 
for such a material, only |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst must be deﬁned.  
Initial Conditions 
In general, a thermodynamic state must be deﬁned by  two state variables.  The need to 
specify |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst and/or |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts|dividesCv2|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst depends on the form of the EOS chosen.  The user s hould 
review the equation term-by-term to establish what parameters to be initialized. *EOS   
1-6 (EOS) LS-DYNA R13 For many of the EOS available, pressure is speciﬁed  (given), and the user must make an 
assumption on either |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts|dividesCv2|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst or |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst.  Consider two possibilities (1) |u1D447||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst is deﬁned or 
assumed from which |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts|dividesCv2|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst may be computed, or (2) |u1D7≠+|dividesCv1|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst is deﬁned or assumed from 
which |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst|zeroCst may be obtained. 
When to Use EOS 
For small strains considerations, a total stress te nsor may be partitioned into a 
deviatoric stress component and a mechanical pressu re. 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst+|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst

Similarly, the total strain tensor may be partition ed into a deviatoric strain component 
(volume-preserving deformation) and a volumetric de formation.

|threeCst is called the mean normal strain, and |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst  is called the dilatation or volume

|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst =|u1D449 − |u1D449|zeroCst
|u1D449|zeroCst 
Roughly speaking, a typical convention may refer to  the relation |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|minuteCst= |u1D4J3 (|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst) as a 
“constitutive equation”, and |u1D443 = |u1D4J3 (|u1D7≠7, |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts) as an EOS.  The use of an EOS may be 
omitted only when volumetric deformation is very sm all, and ||u1D443| ≪ |dividesCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst|dividesCv2. 
A Note About Contact When Using an Equation of Stat e 
When a part includes an equation of state, it is im portant that the initial geometry of 
that part not be perturbed by the contact algorithm .  Such perturbation can arise due to 
initial penetrations in the contact surfaces but ca n usually be avoided by setting the 
variable IGNORE to 1 or 2 in the *CONTACT input or by using a segment based contact 
(SOFT = 2). *EOS_LINEAR_POLYNOMIAL  *EOS

1-8 (EOS) LS-DYNA R13 Remarks: 
1.  Pressure.   The linear polynomial equation of state is linear  in internal energy.  
The pressure is given by: 
|u1D443 = |u1D436|zeroCst+ |u1D436|oneCst|u1D7≠7 + |u1D436|twoCst|u1D7≠7|twoCst+ |u1D436|threeCst|u1D7≠7|threeCst+ |parenleftCv2|u1D436|fourCst+ |u1D436|fiveCst|u1D7≠7 + |u1D436|sixCst|u1D7≠7|twoCst|parenriµhtCv2|u1D438. 
where terms |u1D436|twoCst|u1D7≠7|twoCst and |u1D436|sixCst|u1D7≠7|twoCst are set to zero if |u1D7≠7 < 0 , |u1D7≠7 = |u1D7≠+ |u1D7≠+|zeroCst⁄ − 1 , and |u1D7≠+ |u1D7≠+|zeroCst⁄ is 
the ratio of current density to reference density.  |u1D7≠+ is a nominal or reference 
density deﬁned in the *MAT_NULL card. 
The linear polynomial equation of state may be used  to model gas with the 
gamma law equation of state.  This may be achieved by setting: 
|u1D436|zeroCst= |u1D436|oneCst= |u1D436|twoCst= |u1D436|threeCst= |u1D436|sixCst= 0 
and 
|u1D436|fourCst= |u1D436|fiveCst= |u1D6F∆ − 1 
where  
|u1D6F∆ =|u1D436|u1D4JDCst
|u1D436|u1D463Cst 
is the ratio of speciﬁc heats.  Pressure for a perf ect gas is then given by: 
|u1D443 = (|u1D6F∆ − 1)|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst|u1D438 = (|u1D6F∆ − 1)|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts
|u1D463|u1D4JFCst 
|u1D438 has the units of pressure (where |u1D438 = |u1D4J2|u1D449Cst|zeroCsts and |u1D463|u1D4JFCst= |u1D7≠+|zeroCst|u1D7≠+ ⁄). 
2.  Initial Pressure.   When |u1D436|zeroCst= |u1D436|oneCst= |u1D436|twoCst= |u1D436|threeCst= |u1D436|sixCst= 0, it does not necessarily 
mean that the initial pressure is zero ( |u1D4430≠ |u1D436 0!).  The initial pressure depends 
on the values of all the coeﬃcients and on |u1D7≠7|dividesCv1|u1D461=0 and |u1D438|dividesCv1|u1D461=0.  The pressure in a 
material is computed from the whole equation above,  |u1D443 = |u1D443(µ, |u1D438) .  It is always 
preferable to initialize the initial condition base d on |u1D7≠7|dividesCv1|u1D461=0 and |u1D438|dividesCv1|u1D461=0.  The use of 
|u1D436|zeroCst= |u1D436|oneCst= |u1D436|twoCst= |u1D436|threeCst= |u1D436|sixCst= 0 must be done with caution as it may change the 
form and behavior of the material.  The safest way is to use the whole EOS 
equation to manually check for the pressure value.  For example, for an ideal 
gas, only |u1D436|fourCst and |u1D436|fiveCst are nonzero; |u1D436|fourCst and |u1D436|fiveCst are equal to |u1D6F∆ − 1 while all other 
coeﬃcients ( |u1D436|zeroCst, |u1D436|oneCst, |u1D436|twoCst, |u1D436|threeCst, and |u1D436|sixCst) are zero to satisfy the perfect gas equation 
form.  
3.  V0 and E0.   V0 and E0 deﬁned in this card must be the same as  the time-zero 
ordinates for the 2 load curves deﬁned in the *BOUN DARY_AMBIENT_EOS 
card, if it is used.  This is so that they would bo th consistently deﬁne the same 
initial state for a material. *EOS_JWL  *EOS

Remarks: 
1.  Equation of State.   The JWL equation of state deﬁnes the pressure as 
|u1D4JD = |u1D434 |parenleftCvJ1 −|u1D714
|u1D44J|oneCst|u1D449|parenriµhtCvJ |u1D4J2−|u1D44JCst |oneCsts|u1D449Cst+ |u1D43J |parenleftCvJ1 −|u1D714
|u1D44J|twoCst|u1D449|parenriµhtCvJ |u1D4J2−|u1D44JCst |twoCsts|u1D449Cst+|u1D714|u1D438 
|u1D449, 
and is usually used for detonation products of high  explosives. 
A, B, and E0 have units of pressure.  R1, R2, OMEG,  and V0 are dimensionless.  
It is recommended that a unit system of gram, centi meter, microsecond be used 
when a model includes high explosive(s).  In this c onsistent unit system, pres- 
sure is in Mbar.    
2.  Afterburn.   The AFTERBURN option allows the addition of after burn energy 
|u1D444 to the calculation of pressure by replacing |u1D438 in the above equation with (|u1D438 +
|u1D444), that is, the last term on the right-hand side bec omes 
|u1D714(|u1D438 + |u1D444)
|u1D449 
The simple afterburn option adds the energy at a co nstant rate (OPT = 1) or a 
linearly-increasing rate (OPT = 2) between times T1  and T2 such that the total 
energy added per unit volume at time T2 is the spec iﬁed energy QT.  
For the Miller’s extension model (OPT = 3), the aft erburn energy is added us- 
ing a time-dependent growth term 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠6 
|u1D4J1|u1D461 = |u1D44∆(1 − |u1D7≠6)|u1D4JACst|u1D4JD|u1D4JBCst,         |u1D444 = |u1D7≠6|u1D444|zeroCst  . 
Here, |u1D4JA, |u1D4JB, and |u1D7≠6 are dimensionless, with |u1D7≠6 a positive fraction less than 1.0. The 
parameter |u1D44∆ has units consistent with this growth equation, an d |u1D444|zeroCst has units of 
pressure. *EOS_JWL  *EOS  
LS-DYNA R13 1-13 (EOS) The values for |u1D444|zeroCst, |u1D44∆, |u1D4JA, |u1D4JB published by Miller and Guirguis (1993) are calibr at- 
ed in the units of g, cm, µs, with the consistent p ressure unit of Mbar, though 
in principle any consistent set of units may be use d for calibration.  The factors 
CONM, CONL, and CONT convert the unit system of the  model being ana- 
lyzed to the calibration unit system in which the M iller’s extension parameters 
are speciﬁed, such that a mass value in model units  may be multiplied by 
CONM to obtain the corresponding value in calibrati on units.  These conver- 
sion factors allow consistent evaluation of the gro wth equation in the calibrat- 
ed units.  For user convenience, predeﬁned conversi on factors are provided for 
converting various choices for the model units syst em to the calibration unit 
system used by Miller and Guirguis. 
3.  History Variables.   When this equation of state is used with *MAT_HIG H_EX-
PLOSIVE_BURN in which the variable BETA is set to 0  or 2, the absolute value 
of the history variable labeled as “eﬀective plasti c strain” is the explosive light- 
ing time.  This lighting time takes into account sh adowing if invoked (see 
*CONTROL_EXPLOSIVE_SHADOW).   
There are four additional history variables for the  JWL equation of state.  Those 
history variables are internal energy, bulk viscosi ty in units of pressure, vol- 
ume, and burn fraction, respectively.  To output th e history variables, set the 
variable NEIPH in *DATABASE_EXTENT_BINARY.  
The AFTERBURN option introduces an additional 5 th  history variable that rec- 
ords the added afterburn energy |u1D444 for simple afterburn (OPT = 1 or 2) but 
contains the growth term |u1D7≠6 when using the Miller’s extension model (OPT = 3).*EOS  *EOS_SACK_TUESDAY

Remarks: 
Equation of State Form 7 is used to calculate the s hock initiation (or failure to initiate) 
and detonation wave propagation of solid high explo sives.  It should be used instead of 
the ideal HE burn options whenever there is a quest ion whether the HE will react, there 
is a ﬁnite time required for a shock wave to build up to detonation, and/or there is a 
ﬁnite thickness of the chemical reaction zone in a detonation wave.  At relatively low 
initial pressures (<2-3 GPa), this equation of stat e should be used with material type 10 
for accurate calculations of the unreacted HE behav ior.  At higher initial pressures, 
material type 9 can be used.  A JWL equation of sta te deﬁnes the pressure in the 
unreacted explosive as 
|u1D443|u1D4J2Cst= |u1D4JF|oneCst|u1D4J2−|u1D4JFCst|fiveCsts|u1D449Cst|u1D4J2Csts+ |u1D4JF|twoCst|u1D4J2−|u1D4JFCst|sixCsts|u1D449Cst|u1D4J2Csts+ |u1D4JF|threeCst|u1D447|u1D4J2Cst
|u1D449|u1D4J2Cst, |parenleftCv2|u1D4JF|threeCst= |u1D714|u1D4J2CstC|vCst|rCsts|parenriµhtCv2 
where |u1D449|u1D4J2Cst and |u1D447|u1D4J2Cst are the relative volume and temperature, respectiv ely, of the unreacted 
explosive.  Another JWL equation of state deﬁnes th e pressure in the reaction products 
as 
|u1D443|u1D4JDCst= |u1D44∆|u1D4J2−|u1D46JCst|u1D4JDCst |oneCsts|u1D449Cst|u1D4JDCsts+ |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D46JCst|u1D4JDCst |twoCsts|u1D449Cst|u1D4JDCsts+|u1D4J4|u1D447|u1D4JDCst
|u1D449|u1D4JDCst, |parenleftCv3|u1D4J4 = |u1D714|u1D4JDCstC|vCst|pCsts|parenriµhtCv3 
where |u1D449|u1D4JDCst and |u1D447|u1D4JDCst are the relative volume and temperature, respectiv ely, of the reaction 
products.  As the chemical reaction converts unreac ted explosive to reaction products, 
these JWL equations of state are used to calculate the mixture of unreacted explosive 
and reaction products deﬁned by the fraction reacte d |u1D439 (|u1D439 = 0  implies no reaction, |u1D439 = 1  
implies complete reaction).  The temperatures and p ressures are assumed to be equal 
(|u1D447|u1D4J2Cst= |u1D447|u1D4JDCst, |u1D4JD|u1D4J2Cst= |u1D4JD|u1D4JDCst) and the relative volumes are additive, that is, 
|u1D449 = (1 − |u1D439)|u1D449|u1D4J2Cst+ |u1D439|u1D449|u1D4JDCst 
The chemical reaction rate for conversion of unreac ted explosive to reaction products 
consists of three physically realistic terms:  an i gnition term in which a small amount of 
explosive reacts soon after the shock wave compress es it; a slow growth of reaction as 
this initial reaction spreads; and a rapid completi on of reaction at high pressure and 
temperature.  The form of the reaction rate equatio n is

Details of the computational methods and many examp les of one and two dimensional 
shock initiation and detonation wave calculation ca n be found in the references 
(Cochran and Chan [1979], Lee and Tarver [1980]).  Unfortunately, suﬃcient 
experimental data has been obtained for only two so lid explosives to develop very 
reliable shock initiation models:  PBX-9504 (and th e related HMX-based explosives LX-
14,LX-10,LX-04, etc.) and LX-17 (the insensitive TA TB-based explosive).  Reactive ﬂow 
models have been developed for other explosives (TN T, PETN, Composition B, 
propellants, etc.) but are based on very limited ex perimental data.

Remarks: 
A deﬂagration (burn rate) reactive ﬂow model requir es an unreacted solid equation of 
state, a reaction product equation of state, a reac tion rate law and a mixture rule for the 
two (or more) species.  The mixture rule for the st andard ignition and growth model 
[Lee and Tarver 1980] assumes that both pressures a nd temperatures are completely 
equilibrated as the reaction proceeds.  However, th e mixture rule can be modiﬁed to 
allow no thermal conduction or partial heating of t he solid by the reaction product 
gases.  For this relatively slow process of airbag propellant burn, the thermal and 
pressure equilibrium assumptions are valid.  The eq uations of state currently used in 
the burn model are the JWL, Gruneisen, the van der Waals co-volume, and the perfect 
gas law, but other equations of state can be easily  implemented.  In this propellant burn, 
the gaseous nitrogen produced by the burning sodium  azide obeys the perfect gas law 
as it ﬁlls the airbag but may have to be modeled as  a van der Waal’s gas at the high 
pressures and temperatures produced in the propella nt chamber.  The chemical reaction 
rate law is pressure, particle geometry and surface  area dependent, as are most high-
pressure burn processes.  When the temperature proﬁ le of the reacting system is well 
known, temperature dependent Arrhenius chemical kin etics can be used. 
 
Since the airbag propellant composition and perform ance data are company private 
information, it is very diﬃcult to obtain the requi red information for burn rate 
modeling.  However, Imperial Chemical Industries (I CI) Corporation supplied pressure 
exponent, particle geometry, packing density, heat of reaction, and atmospheric 
pressure burn rate data which allowed us to develop  the numerical model presented 
here for their NaN 3 + Fe 2O3 driver airbag propellant.  The deﬂagration model, its 
implementation, and the results for the ICI propell ant are presented in [Hallquist, et.al., 
1990].

form: 
|u1D4JD = |u1D434|u1D4J2−|u1D44JCst |oneCsts|u1D449Csts+ |u1D43J|u1D4J2−|u1D44JCst |twoCsts|u1D449Csts+|u1D714|u1D436|u1D463Cst|u1D447Cst 
|u1D449 − |u1D4J1  , 
where |u1D4JD is pressure (in Mbars), |u1D449 is the relative speciﬁc volume (inverse of relativ e 
density), |u1D714 is the Gruneisen coeﬃcient, |u1D436|u1D463Cst is heat capacity (in Mbars -cc/cc°K), |u1D447 is the 
temperature in °K, |u1D4J1 is the co-volume, and |u1D434, |u1D43J, |u1D44J|oneCst and |u1D44J|twoCst  are constants.  Setting |u1D434 =
|u1D43J = 0  yields the van der Waal’s co-volume equation of st ate.  The JWL equation of state 
is generally useful at pressures above several kilo bars, while the van der Waal’s is 
useful at pressures below that range and above the range for which the perfect gas law 
holds.  Additionally, setting |u1D434 = |u1D43J = |u1D4J1 = 0  yields the perfect gas law.  If accurate values 
of |u1D714 and |u1D436|u1D463Cst plus the correct distribution between “cold” compr ession and internal 
energies are used, the calculated temperatures are very reasonable and thus can be used 
to check propellant performance. 
 
The reaction rate used for the propellant deﬂagrati on process is of the form: 
∂|u1D439
∂|u1D461= |u1D44D(1 − |u1D439)|u1D466Cst|u1D439|u1D46JCst|u1D4JD|u1D464Cst|uni23DFClft|uni23DFCex|uni23DFCex|uni23DFCmd|uni23DFCex|uni23DFCex|uni23DFCrt
|zeroCst<|u1D439Cst<|u1D439Cstlimit1 + |u1D449(1 − |u1D439)|u1D462Cst|u1D439|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JD|u1D46≠Cst|uni23DFClft|uni23DFCex|uni23DFCex|uni23DFCmd|uni23DFCex|uni23DFCex|uni23DFCrt
|u1D439Cstlimit2 <|u1D439Cst<|oneCst 
where |u1D439 is the fraction reacted ( |u1D439 = 0  implies no reaction, |u1D439 = 1  is complete reaction), |u1D461 
is time, and |u1D4JD is pressure (in Mbars), |u1D4JF, |u1D46≠, |u1D462, |u1D464, |u1D46J, |u1D466, |u1D439limit1   and |u1D439limit2  are constants used 
to describe the pressure dependence and surface are a dependence of the reaction rates.  
Two (or more) pressure dependant reaction rates are  included in case the propellant is a 
mixture or exhibited a sharp change in reaction rat e at some pressure or temperature.  
Burning surface area dependencies can be approximat ed using the (1 − |u1D439)|u1D466Cst|u1D439|u1D46JCst terms.  
Other forms of the reaction rate law, such as Arrhe nius temperature dependent |u1D4J2−|u1D438Cst |u1D44JCst|u1D447Cst ⁄  
type rates, can be used, but these require very acc urate temperatures calculations.  
Although the theoretical justiﬁcation of pressure d ependent burn rates at kilobar type 
pressures is not complete, a vast amount of experim ental burn rate as a function of 
pressure data does demonstrate this eﬀect and hydro dynamic calculations using 
pressure dependent burn accurately simulate such ex periments. 
 
The deﬂagration reactive ﬂow model is activated by any pressure or particle velocity 
increase on one or more zone boundaries in the reac tive material.  Such an increase 
creates pressure in those zones and the decompositi on begins.  If the pressure is 
relieved, the reaction rate decreases and can go to  zero.  This feature is important for 
short duration, partial decomposition reactions.  I f the pressure is maintained, the 
fraction reacted eventually reaches one and the mat erial is completely converted to 
product molecules.  The deﬂagration front rates of advance through the propellant 
calculated by this model for several propellants ar e quite close to the experimentally 
observed burn rate versus pressure curves. 
 *EOS  *EOS_PROPELLANT_DEFLAGRATION  
1-36 (EOS) LS-DYNA R13 To obtain good agreement with experimental deﬂagrat ion data, the model requires an 
accurate description of the unreacted propellant eq uation of state, either an analytical ﬁt 
to experimental compression data or an estimated ﬁt  based on previous experience with 
similar materials.  This is also true for the react ion products equation of state.  The more 
experimental burn rate, pressure production and ene rgy delivery data available, the 
better the form and constants in the reaction rate equation can be determined. 
 
Therefore, the equation used in the burn subroutine  for the pressure in the unreacted 
propellant is 
|u1D443|u1D462Cst= R1 × |u1D4J2−R5×|u1D449Cst |u1D462Csts+ R2 × |u1D4J2−R6\|tCst|iCst|mCst|eCst|sCst |u1D449Cst |u1D462Csts+R3 × |u1D447|u1D462Cst
|u1D449|u1D462Cst− FRER   , 
where |u1D449|u1D462Cst and |u1D447|u1D462Cst are the relative volume and temperature respective ly of the unreacted 
propellant.  The relative density is obviously the inverse of the relative volume.  The 
pressure |u1D443|u1D4JDCst in the reaction products is given by: 
|u1D443|u1D4JDCst= A × |u1D4J2−XP1×|u1D449Cst |u1D4JDCsts+ B × |u1D4J2−XP2×|u1D449Cst |u1D4JDCsts+|u1D43A × |u1D447|u1D4JDCst
|u1D449|u1D443Cst− CCRIT   . 
As the reaction proceeds, the unreacted and product  pressures and temperatures are 
assumed to be equilibrated ( |u1D447|u1D462Cst= |u1D447|u1D4JDCst= |u1D447, |u1D443 = |u1D443|u1D462Cst= |u1D443|u1D4JDCst) while the relative volumes are 
additive: 
|u1D449 = (1 − |u1D439)|u1D449|u1D462Cst+ |u1D439|u1D449|u1D4JDCst  
where |u1D449 is the total relative volume.  Other mixture assum ptions can and have been 
used in diﬀerent versions of DYNA2D/3D.  The reacti on rate law has the form: 
|u1D71J|u1D439 
|u1D71J|u1D461 = GROW1 × (|u1D443 + FREQ)EM (|u1D439 + FMXIG)AR1 (1 − |u1D439 + FMIXG)ES1 
+ GROW2 × (|u1D443 + FREQ)EN (|u1D439 + FMIXG)AR2 (1 − |u1D439 + FMIXG)ES2   . 
If |u1D439 exceeds FMXGR, the GROW1 term is set equal to zero , and, if |u1D439 is less than FMN-
GR, the GROW2 term is zero.  Thus, two separate (or  overlapping) burn rates can be 
used to describe the rate at which the propellant d ecomposes. 
 
This equation of state subroutine is used together with a material model to describe the 
propellant.  In the airbag propellant case, a null material model (type #10) can be used.  
Material type 10 is usually used for a solid propel lant or explosive when the shear 
modulus and yield strength are deﬁned.  The propell ant material is deﬁned by the 
material model and the unreacted equation of state until the reaction begins.  The 
calculated mixture states are used until the reacti on is complete and then the reaction 
product equation of state is used.  The heat of rea ction,  ENQ, is assumed to be a 
constant and the same at all values of |u1D439 but more complex energy release laws could be 
implemented.

Remarks: 
The pore collapse model described in the TENSOR man ual [23] is no longer valid and 
has been replaced by a much simpler method.  This i s due in part to the lack of 
experimental data required for the more complex mod el.  It is desired to have a close 
approximation of the TENSOR model in the LS-DYNA co de to enable a quality link 
between them.  The TENSOR model deﬁnes two curves, the virgin loading curve and 
the completely crushed curve, as shown in Figure EOS11-1 , as well as the excess 
compression point required for pore collapse to beg in, |u1D7≠7|oneCst, and the excess compression 
point required to completely crush the material, |u1D7≠7|twoCst.  From this data and the maximum 
excess compression the material has attained, |u1D462max , the pressure for any excess 
compression, |u1D7≠7, can be determined. 
 
Unloading occurs along the virgin loading curve unt il the excess compression surpasses 
|u1D7≠7|oneCst.  After that, the unloading follows a path between the completely crushed curve and 
the virgin loading curve.  Reloading will follow th is curve back up to the virgin loading *EOS_TENSOR_PORE_COLLAPSE  *EOS  
LS-DYNA R13 1-39 (EOS) curve.  Once the excess compression exceeds |u1D7≠7|twoCst, then all unloading will follow the 
completely crushed curve. 
 
For unloading between |u1D7≠7|oneCst and |u1D7≠7|twoCst a partially crushed curve is determined by: 
|u1D4JDpc |parenleftCv1|u1D7≠7|parenriµhtCv1 = |u1D4JDcc |<racketleftCvJ|parenleftCv11 + |u1D7≠7|u1D43JCst|parenriµhtCv1|parenleftCv11 + |u1D7≠7|parenriµhtCv1

|u1D449 increases to account for pore recovery in the mate rial.

The bulk sound speed is determined from the slope o f the completely crushed curve at 
the current pressure to avoid instabilities in the time step. 
 
The virgin loading and completely crushed curves ar e modeled with monotonic cubic-
splines.  An optimized vector interpolation scheme is then used to evaluate the cubic-
splines.  The bulk modulus and sound speed are deri ved from a linear interpolation on 
the derivatives of the cubic-splines. *EOS_IDEAL_GAS  *EOS

1.  Pressure.   The pressure in the ideal gas law is deﬁned as 
|u1D4JD = |u1D7≠+(|u1D436|u1D4JDCst− |u1D436|u1D463Cst)|u1D447
|u1D436|u1D4JDCst= |u1D436|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst+ |u1D436|u1D43FCst|u1D447 + |u1D436|u1D444Cst|u1D447|twoCst

where |u1D436|u1D4JDCst and |u1D436|u1D463Cst are the speciﬁc heat capacities at constant pressu re and at 
constant volume, respectively. |u1D7≠+ is the density.  The relative volume is deﬁned 
as 
|u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst=|u1D449
|u1D449|zeroCst=(|u1D449 |u1D44≠ ⁄ )
(|u1D449|zeroCst|u1D44≠ ⁄ )=|u1D71≠
|u1D71≠|zeroCst=|u1D7≠+|zeroCst
|u1D7≠+  , 
where |u1D7≠+|zeroCst is a nominal or reference density deﬁned in the *M AT_NULL card.  
The initial pressure can then be manually computed as 
|u1D443||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst  =   |u1D7≠+|dividesCv1|u1D461Cst=|zeroCst(|u1D436|u1D443Cst− |u1D436|u1D449Cst)|u1D447||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst

The initial relative volume, |u1D71≠|u1D4JFCst||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst (V0), initial temperature, |u1D447||u1D461Cst=|zeroCst(T0), and heat 
capacity information are deﬁned in the *EOS_IDEAL_G AS input.  Note that 
the “reference” density is typically a density at a  non-stressed or nominal stress 
state.  The initial pressure should always be check ed manually against simula- 
tion result. 
2.  Energy Conservation.  With adiabatic ﬂag on, the adiabatic state is conse rved, 
but exact  internal energy conservation is sacriﬁced. 
3.  Deviation from Ideal Gas Model.   The ideal gas model is good for low density 
gas only.  Deviation from the ideal gas behavior ma y be indicated by the com- 
pressibility factor deﬁned as 
|u1D44D =|u1D443|u1D71≠ 
|u1D44J|u1D447  
When |u1D44D deviates from 1, the gas behavior deviates from id eal. 
4.  Initial Temperature and Initial Relative Volume.  V0 and T0 deﬁned in this 
card must be the same as the time-zero ordinates fo r the 2 load curves deﬁned 
in the *BOUNDARY_AMBIENT_EOS card, if it is used.  This is so that they 
both would consistently deﬁne the same initial stat e for a material. *EOS_PHASE_CHANGE  *EOS

This is  Equation of State Form 14.  The JWLB (Jones-Wilkens -Lee-Baker) equation of 
state, developed by Baker [1991] and further descri bed by Baker and Orosz [1991], 
describes the high pressure regime produced by over driven detonations while retaining 
the low pressure expansion behavior required for st andard acceleration modeling.  The 
derived form of the equation of state is based on t he JWL form due to its computational 
robustness and asymptotic approach to an ideal gas at high expansions.  Additional 
exponential terms and a variable Gruneisen paramete r have been added to adequately 
describe the high-pressure region above the Chapman -Jouguet state.

This is Equation of State Form 15.  This EOS works with solid elements and thick shell 
formulations ELFORM = 2, 3, 5 and 7 to model the re sponse of gaskets.  For the thick 
shell formulation #2 only, it is completely decoupl ed from the shell material, meaning 
in the local coordinate system of the shell, this m odel deﬁnes the normal stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D467Cst|u1D467Cst , and 
does not change any of the other stress components.  The model is a reduction of the

The Murnaghan equation of state deﬁnes pressure as

To model ﬂuid ﬂows accurately, |u1D6F∆ is often set to 7, and /u1D458|zeroCst is chosen such that 
/u1D450|zeroCst=/radical.v5|u1D6F∆/u1D458|zeroCst
|u1D7≠+|zeroCst≥ 10|u1D463|mCst|aCst|xCst    , 
where |u1D463|mCst|aCst|xCst  is the maximum expected ﬂuid ﬂow velocity.  This w ill ensure low 
compressibility while allowing for a relatively lar ge time step size. *EOS  *EOS_USER_DEFINED

LS-DYNA R13 2-1 (MAT) *MAT 
 
LS-DYNA has historically referenced each material m odel by a number.  As shown 
below, a three digit numerical designation can stil l be used, e.g., *MAT_001, and is 
equivalent to a corresponding descriptive designati on, e.g., *MAT_ELASTIC. The two 
equivalent commands for each material model, one nu merical and the other descriptive, 
are listed below.  The numbers in square brackets ( see key below) identify the element 
formulations for which the material model is implem ented.  The number in the curly 
brackets, {n}, indicates the default number of history variables  per element integration 
point that are stored in addition to the 7 history variables which are stored by default.  
Just as an example, for the type 16 fully integrate d shell elements with 2 integration 
points through the thickness, the total number of h istory variables is 8× (|u1D4JB +7).  For 
the Belytschko-Tsay type 2 element the number is 2 × (|u1D4JB +7).   
 
The meaning associated with particular extra histor y variables for a subset of material 
models and equations of state are  tabulated at http://www.dynasupport.com/howtos-
/material/history-variables . 
 
An additional option TITLE may be appended to a *MAT keyword in which case an 
additional line is read in 80a format which can be used to describe the material.  At 
present, LS-DYNA does not make use of the title.  I nclusion of titles simply gives 
greater clarity to input decks.

1 Error associated with advection inherently leads t o state variables that may be inconsistent with 
nonlinear constitutive routines and thus may lead t o nonphysical results, nonconservation of energy, a nd 
even numerical instability in some cases.  Caution is advised, particularly when using the 2 nd  tier of 
material models implemented for ALE multi-material solids (designated by [8B]) which are largely

Remarks: 
Curves and tables are sometimes needed for deﬁning material properties.  An example 
would be a curve of eﬀective stress as a function o f eﬀective plastic strain deﬁned using 
the command *DEFINE_CURVE.  In general, the followi ng can be said about curves 
and tables that are referenced by material models:   
1.  Curves are internally rediscretized using equal in crements along the |u1D46J-axis.   
2.  Curve data is interpolated between rediscretized d ata points within the 
deﬁned range of the curve and extrapolated as neede d beyond the deﬁned 
range of the curve. 
3.  Extrapolation is not employed for table value.  Se e the manual entries for the 
*DEFINE_TABLE_… keywords.  
4.  See Remarks under *DEFINE_CURVE and *DEFINE_TABLE.*MAT  MATERIAL MODEL REFERENCE TABLES  
2-10 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 MATERIAL MODEL REFERENCE TABLES 
The tables provided on the following pages list the  material models, some of their 
attributes, and the general classes of physical mat erials to which the numerical models 
might be applied. 
If a material model, without consideration of *MAT_ ADD_EROSION, *MAT_ADD_-
THERMAL_EXPANSION, *MAT_ADD_SOC_EXPANSION, *MAT_ADD _DAMAGE, 
*MAT_ADD_GENERALIZED_DAMAGE or *MAT_ADD_INELASTICIT Y, includes 
any of the following attributes, a “Y” will appear in the respective column of the table: 
 SRATE - Strain-rate eﬀects 
 FAIL - Failure criteria 
 EOS - Equation-of-State required for 3D solids and  2D

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
PID Part ID for which the chemical shrinkage eﬀect applies 
LCID Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning the chemical 
shrinkage coeﬃcient, |u1D6FD, or a proxy in experiments for the 
chemical shrinkage coeﬃcient, |u1D6F+, as a function of temperature, |u1D447. 
If |u1D6F+ as a function of |u1D447 is deﬁned, |u1D6F+ is converted to the chemical 
shrinkage coeﬃcient by LS-DYNA (see Remark 2 ).  
Remarks: 
1.  Chemical Shrinkage Effect on Strain.   If the chemical shrinkage eﬀect is 
included, the strain rate tensor, /u1D6C6̇, is given by 
/u1D6C6̇=/u1D6C6̇|u1D4J2Cst+/u1D6C6̇|u1D4JDCst+/u1D6C6̇|u1D4J≠Cst  . 
Here, /u1D6C6̇|u1D4J2Cst is the elastic strain rate tensor, /u1D6C6̇|u1D4JDCst is the plastic strain rate tensor, and /u1D6C6̇|u1D4J≠Cst 
is the chemical shrinkage strain rate tensor. /u1D6C6̇|u1D4J≠Cst is given by 
/u1D6C6̇|u1D4J≠Cst= |u1D6FD|u1D447̇/u1D408  . 
Here |u1D6FD is the chemical shrinkage coeﬃcient and |u1D447̇ is the rate of temperature 
change.  
2.  Chemical Shrinkage Coefﬁcient.   The chemical shrinkage coeﬃcient can be 
deﬁned in two ways with LCID: either directly or th rough the proxy variable 
from experiments, |u1D6F+. If |u1D6F+ is deﬁned as the ordinate, LS-DYNA internally con-
verts the ordinate of the load curve, LCID, to |u1D6FD: 
|u1D6FD = (1 − |u1D6F+)|threeCst− 1  . *MAT_ADD_CHEM_SHRINKAGE  *MAT  
LS-DYNA R13 2-43 (MAT) Note that DATTYP on *DEFINE_CURVE must be set to  -100 if LCID deﬁnes |u1D6F+ as 
a function of temperature. 
3.  Thermal Expansion with Shrinkage Effects.   If both thermal expansion and 
chemical shrinkage eﬀects are modeled in one simula tion, the thermal expan- 
sion should be deﬁned with *MAT_THERMAL_ISOTROPIC_T ITLE.  The TI-
TLE keyword option must be deﬁned to distinguish be tween the thermal 
expansion and chemical shrinkage. *MAT  *MAT_ADD_COHESIVE  
2-44 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 *MAT_ADD_COHESIVE  
The ADD_COHESIVE option oﬀers the possibility to us e a selection of three 
dimensional material models in LS-DYNA in conjuncti on with cohesive elements. 
 
Usually the cohesive elements (ELFORM = 19 and 20 o f *SECTION_SOLID) can only be 
used with a small number of material models (41-50,  138, 184, 185, 186, 240).  But with 
this additional keyword, a larger number of standar d three dimensional material 
models can be used that would only be available for  solid elements in general.  
Currently the following material models are support ed: 1, 3, 4, 6, 15, 24, 41-50, 57, 81, 82, 
83, 89, 96, 98, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 115, 120, 123, 124, 141, 168, 173, 187, 188, 193, 224, 
225, 251, 252, 255, 277, and 307.

Cohesive elements possess 3 kinematic variables, na mely, two relative displacements |u1D6FF|oneCst, 
|u1D6FF|twoCst in tangential directions and one relative displace ment |u1D6FF|threeCst in normal direction.  In a 
corresponding constitutive model, they are used to compute 3 associated traction 
stresses |u1D461|oneCst, |u1D461|twoCst, and |u1D461|threeCst.  For example, in the elastic case (*MAT_COHESIVE_ ELASTIC):

To be able to use such three dimensional material m odels in a cohesive element 
environment, an assumption is necessary to transfor m 3 relative displacements to 6 
strain rates.  Therefore, it is assumed that neithe r lateral expansion nor in-plane

Many of the constitutive models in LS-DYNA do not a llow failure and erosion.  The 
ADD_DAMAGE_DIEM option provides a way of including damage and failure in these 
models.  DIEM comprises various “damage initiation and evolution models.” See 
remarks for details. 
 
This keyword originates from a split out of *MAT_AD D_EROSION, where only 
“sudden” failure criteria without damage remain.  I t applies to nonlinear element 
formulations including 2D continuum elements, beam element formulation 1, 3D shell 
elements (including isogeometric shells), 3D solid elements (including isogeometric 
solids) and thick shells. 
NOTE:  All *MAT_ADD_DAMAGE_DIEM commands in a

Remarks: 
1.  DEPS.   In DIEM, you may invoke up to 5 damage initiation  and evolution 
criteria.  For the sake of eﬃciency, the parameter DEPS can be used to only 
check these criteria in quantiﬁed increments of pla stic strain.  In other words, 
the criteria are only checked when the eﬀective pla stic strain goes beyond 
DEPS , 2 × DEPS , 3 × DEPS , etc.  For DEPS = 0 the checks are performed in ea ch 
step there is plastic ﬂow.  A reasonable value of D EPS could, for instance, be

2-52 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 2.  Damage Initiation and Evolution Variables.   Assume that |u1D4JB initia- 
tion/evolution types have been speciﬁed in the inpu t deck ( |u1D4JB = NDIEMC ). At 
each integration point a damage initiation variable , |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4J6Cst, and an evolution histo- 
ry variable |u1D437|u1D4J6Cst exist, such that, 
|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4J6Cst∈[0,∞) 
and 
|u1D437|u1D4J6Cst∈[0,1]  , |u1D4J6 = 1,…|u1D4JB  . 
These are initially set to zero and evolve with the  deformation of the elements 
according to rules associated with the speciﬁc dama ge initiation and evolution 
type chosen, see below for details. 
These quantities can be post-processed as ordinary material history variables 
and their positions in the history variables array is given in d3hsp , search for 
the string Damage history listing . The damage initiation variables do not inﬂu- 
ence the results but serve to indicate the onset of  damage.  As an alternative, 
the keyword *DEFINE_MATERIAL_HISTORIES can be used to output the 
instability and damage, following

Damage - - - - Eﬀective damage  |u1D437, see below 
The damage evolution variables govern the damage in  the material and are 
used to form the global damage |u1D437∈[0,1] .  Each criterion is of either of DCTYP 
set to maximum ( DCT Y P = 0 ) or multiplicative ( DCT Y P = 1 ), or one could 
choose to not couple damage to the stress by settin g DCT Y P = −1 . This means 
that the damage value is calculated and stored, but  it is not aﬀecting the stress 
as for the other options, so if all DCTYP are set t o −1 there will be no damage 
or failure.  Letting /u1D4:Cmax  denote the set of evolution types with DCTYP set t o 
maximum and /u1D4:Cmult  denote the set of evolution types with DCTYP set t o multi- 
plicative the global damage, |u1D437, is deﬁned as 
|u1D437 = max(|u1D437|mCst|aCst|xCst , |u1D437|mCst /u.st/l.st|tCst )  , 
where

LS-DYNA R13 2-53 (MAT) The damage variable relates the macroscopic (damage d) to microscopic (true) 
stress by 
|u1D7≠∆ = (1 − |u1D437)|u1D7≠∆̃  . 
Once the damage has reached the level of |u1D437|eCst /r.st/o.st/d.st |eCst  (=0.99 by default) the stress is 
set to zero and the integration point is assumed fa iled and not processed there- 
after.  For NUMFIP > 0, a shell element is eroded a nd removed from the ﬁnite 
element model when NUMFIP integration points have f ailed.  For NUM-
FIP < 0, a shell element is eroded and removed from  the ﬁnite element model 
when -NUMFIP percent of the layers have failed. 
Damage Initiation, /u1D̅4E/u1D46B: 
For each evolution type  |u1D4J6, |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4J6Cst governs the onset of damage.  For |u1D4J6 ≠/u1D45̅, the evolution of 
|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4J6Cst is independent from the evolution of  |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4J7Cst.  The following list enumerates the 
algorithms for modelling damage initiation. 
 
In this subsection we suppress the superscripted |u1D4J6 indexing the evolution type. 
1.  Ductility Based on Stress Triaxiality (DITYP = 0).  For the ductile initiation 
option, a function |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D7≠2, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst) represents the plastic strain at onset of dam- 
age (P1).  This is a function of stress triaxiality  deﬁned as 
|u1D7≠2 = −|u1D4JD
/u1D45E  , 
with |u1D4JD being the pressure and /u1D45E the von Mises equivalent stress.  Optionally 
this can be deﬁned as a table with the second depen dency being on the eﬀec- 
tive plastic strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, where a negative sign of the ﬁrst strain rate in the 
table means that it is in logarithmic scale. The da mage initiation history varia- 
ble evolves according to 
|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st=/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠Cst|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst  . 
2.  Shear (DITYP = 1).  For the shear initiation option, a function |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst(/u1D̅0:, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst) 
represents the plastic strain at onset of damage (P 1).  This is a function of a 
shear stress function deﬁned as 
/u1D̅0:=/u1D45E+/u1D458/u1D446.st|u1D4JD
/u1D̅0F  . 
Here |u1D4JD is the pressure, /u1D45E is the von Mises equivalent stress and /u1D̅0F is the maxi- 
mum shear stress deﬁned as a function of the princi pal stress values: 
/u1D̅0F=|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst /∗.st/o.st/r.st− |u1D7≠∆|mCst|iCst|nCst /o.st/r.st|parenriµhtCv2
2  . *MAT  *MAT_ADD_DAMAGE_DIEM  
2-54 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 Introduced here is also the pressure inﬂuence param eter /u1D458|u1D46≠Cst (P2).  Optionally 
this can be deﬁned as a table with the second depen dency being on the eﬀec- 
tive plastic strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, where a negative sign of the ﬁrst strain rate in the 
table means that it is in logarithmic scale. The da mage initiation history varia- 
ble evolves according to 
|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st=/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠Cst|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst. 
3.  MSFLD (DITYP = 2).   For the MSFLD initiation option, a function |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst=
|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D6F+, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst) represents the plastic strain at onset of damage ( P1).  This is a function 
of the ratio of principal plastic strain rates deﬁn ed as 
|u1D6F+ =|u1D7≠≠̇|mCst|iCst|nCst /o.st/r.st|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠̇|mCst|aCst /∗.st/o.st/r.st|u1D4JDCst . 
The MSFLD criterion is only relevant for shells and  with restrictions (discussed 
in the section MSFLD and FLD with solid and thick shell elements ) for 
hexa/penta solids/tshells.  The principal strains s hould be interpreted as the 
in-plane principal strains.  For simplicity the pla stic strain evolution in this 
formula is assumed to stem from an associated von M ises ﬂow rule.  Hence, 
|u1D6F+ =|u1D46≠|mCst|iCst|nCst /o.st/r.st
|u1D46≠|mCst|aCst /∗.st/o.st/r.st 
with |u1D46≠ being the deviatoric stress.  This ensures that th e calculation of |u1D6F+, is in a 
sense, robust at the expense of being slightly inac curate for materials with ani- 
sotropic yield functions and/or non-associated ﬂow rules.  Optionally this can 
be deﬁned as a table with the second dependency bei ng on the eﬀective plastic 
strain rate, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, where a negative sign of the ﬁrst strain rate in the table means 
that it is in logarithmic scale.  For |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst= 0, the value of |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst is set to a large num- 
ber to prevent the onset of damage for no plastic e volution.  Furthermore, the 
plastic strain used in this failure criteria is a m odiﬁed eﬀective plastic strain 
that only evolves when the pressure is negative, me aning the material is not 
aﬀected in compression. 
This modiﬁed plastic strain can be monitored as the  second history variable of 
the initiation history variables in the binary outp ut database.  For P3 = 0, the 
damage initiation history variable is calculated di rectly from the ratio of (mod- 
iﬁed) plastic strain and the critical plastic strai n 
|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st= max|u1D461Cst≤|u1D447Cst|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst  . 
This should be interpreted as the maximum value up to this point in time.  If 
P3 = 1 the damage initiation history variable is in stead incrementally updated 
from the ratio of (modiﬁed) plastic strain and the critical plastic strain *MAT_ADD_DAMAGE_DIEM  *MAT  
LS-DYNA R13 2-55 (MAT) |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st=/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠Cst|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst  . 
For this initiation option with shells, P2 is used to determine the layer in the 
shell where the criterion is evaluated.  If P2 = 0,  the criterion is evaluated in the 
mid-layer only, whereas if P2 = 1, it is evaluated in the outer layers only (bot- 
tom and top).  This can be used to distinguish betw een a membrane instability 
typically used for FLD evaluations (P2 = 0) and a b ending instability (P2 = 1).  
For shells, as soon as |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st reaches 1 in any of the integration points of inte rest, 
all  integration points in the shell goes over in damag e mode, meaning subse- 
quent damage is applied to the entire element.  For  solids/tshells, only P2 = 0 
is currently supported, and when |u1D714/u1D4:̅.st reaches 1 in the center of the section then 
all elements in the section goes into damage mode.  Again, more details for 
solids or thick shells are provided in the section titled MSFLD and FLD with 
solid and thick shell elements . 
4.  FLD (DITYP = 3).  The FLD initiation criterion is identical to MSFLD  with one 
subtle diﬀerence: the plastic strain used to evalua te the criteria does not ac- 
count for the sign of the hydrostatic stress but is  instead identical to the eﬀec- 
tive plastic strain directly from the underlying ma terial model.  In other words, 
it is not the modiﬁed plastic strain used in the MS FLD criterion, but apart from 
that it is an identical criterion. 
5.  Ductile based on normalized principal stress (DITYP  = 4).  For the ductile 
initiation option the plastic strain at the onset o f damage (P1) is taken as a func- 
tion of |u1D6FD and |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, that is |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D6FD, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst). Here |u1D6FD is the normalized principal stress 
|u1D6FD =/u1D45E+/u1D458/u1D451.st|u1D4JD
|u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst /∗.st/o.st/r.st   , 
where |u1D4JD is the pressure, /u1D45E is the von Mises equivalent stress, |u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst /∗.st/o.st/r.st is the major 
principal stress, and /u1D458/u1D451.st is the pressure inﬂuence parameter speciﬁed in the  P2 
ﬁeld.  Optionally, this can be deﬁned as a table wi th the second dependency 
being on the eﬀective plastic strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, where a negative sign of the ﬁrst 
strain rate in the table means that it is in logari thmic scale. The damage initia- 
tion history variable evolves according to 
|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st=/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:̅.st|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠Cst|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst  . 
 
MSFLD and FLD with solid and thick shell elements 
 
When using MSFLD or FLD with solid or thick shell e lements, the following restrictions 
apply: *MAT  *MAT_ADD_DAMAGE_DIEM  
2-56 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 • The part should be a thin walled section, with a well-deﬁned “ thickness ” 
direction, /u1D4∫5, and associated “ plane ” indicated in blue in Figure 2-1 . 
• Only low order hexahedra or pentahedra may be use d. 
• The same number of elements in /u1D4∫5-direction must be used, essentially in the form 
of an extruded shell mesh.  The stack of elements a t any location, from bottom to 
top, comprises the “section”. 
• The element numbering scheme must in itself indic ate the thickness direction, /u1D4∫5, 
as illustrated in Figure 2-1 , for each element in the part. 
• The geometry may be curved, but the mesh topology  must not change.  Thus, for 
T-intersections and similar geometries, appropriate  pre-processing measures 
must be undertaken.

/u1D45∫|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst|u1D714/u1D4:̅.st≥ 1 
Here /u1D45∫ is a characteristic length of the element.  Fractu re energy is related to plastic 
displacement as follows 
|u1D43A/u1D45:.st=/integral.v:|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D4J1|u1D462|u1D4JDCst|u1D462Cst/u1D45:.sts|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst  , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst is the yield stress.  The following list enumerate s the algorithms available for 
modelling damage. 
1.  Linear (DETYP = 0).  With this option, if |u1D6F+ = 0  (Q3) and Q1 is positive, the 
damage variable evolves linearly with the plastic d isplacement after onset of 
damage: 
|u1D437̇=|u1D462̇|u1D4JDCst
|u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst  .  
Here |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst is the plastic displacement at failure (Q1).  
If Q1 is negative, then –Q1 refers to a table that deﬁnes |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst as a function of triax- 
iality and damage, that is, |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst= |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D7≠2, |u1D437) . In this case with |u1D6F+ = 0 , the damage 
evolution law generalizes to:  
|u1D437̇=|u1D462̇|u1D4JDCst
∂|u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst
∂|u1D437 . 
For a ﬁxed triaxiality, |u1D7≠2, |u1D462̅/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst:= |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D7≠2, 1)  deﬁnes the plastic displacement at fail- 
ure, and the shape of |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst(|u1D7≠2, |u1D437)  as a function of |u1D437 determines the post-instability 
characteristics.  
A linear curve, as illustrated by the solid line in  Figure 2-2 , corresponds exactly 
to a constant plastic displacement to failure equal  to |u1D462̅/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst and can be seen as a 
reference curve for this discussion.  For simplicit y assume uniaxial tension ( |u1D7≠2 =
1/3). A curve with positive curvature, represented by the dash-dots in Fig- 
ure 2-2 , means that damage evolves quickly right after ons et of instability and 
more slowly when approaching failure.  In contrast,  damage evolves slowly 
early and more quickly later on for a curve with ne gative curvature, represent- 
ed by the dashes.  The qualitative eﬀect these curv es have in a uniaxial tension 
test is also illustrated.  The correlation between a damage curve and the actual 
behavior in tests is not straightforward, thus thes e curves need to be estab- 
lished on a trial-and-error basis. 
For |u1D6F+ > 0  and |u1D462/u1D45:.st|u1D4JDCst> 0, the damage evolution follows an exponential law g iven 
by *MAT  *MAT_ADD_DAMAGE_DIEM

Many of the constitutive models in LS-DYNA do not a llow failure and erosion.  The

these models. GISSMO is the “generalized incrementa l stress-state dependent damage

This keyword originates from a split out of *MAT_AD D_EROSION, where only 
“sudden” failure criteria without damage remain, an d applies to nonlinear element 
formulations including 2D continuum elements, beam element formulation 1, 3D shells 
(including isogeometric shells), 3D thick shells, 3 D solids (including isogeometric

The STOCHASTIC option allows spatially varying fail ure behavior.  See *DEFINE_-

equivalent plastic strain to failure as a function of triax-

a 3D table can be used, where failure strain is a f unc-

meaning an odd number for NIP should be used.  The other

reduce the stresses.  Those still below the critica l value 
still do not couple, only if they reach their crite rion.  
EQ.2.0: Active.  All of the non-mid- plane IPs immediately start 
to reduce the stresses.  NUMFIP is active. 
EQ.3.0: Active.  Same as 2 but when D = 1 is reached in the 
middle integration point, the element is eroded ins tan- 
taneously.  NUMFIP is disregarded.  
EQ.4.0: Active.  Damage and fai lure are applied only to the 
midpoint.  When D = 1 at the midpoint, the element is 
eroded.  NUM FIP is disregarded.  Integration points

Remarks: 
The GISSMO damage model is a phenomenological formu lation that allows for an 
incremental description of damage accumulation, inc luding softening and failure.  It is 
intended to provide a maximum in variability for th e description of damage for a 
variety of metallic materials, such as *MAT_024, *M AT_036, and *MAT_103. The input 
of parameters is based on tabulated data, allowing the user to directly convert test data 
to numerical input.  The model was originally devel oped by Neukamm et al.  [2008] and 
further investigated and enhanced by Eﬀelsberg et a l.  [2012] and Andrade et al.  [2014, 
2016]. *MAT  *MAT_ADD_DAMAGE_GISSMO  
2-66 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 The model is based on an incremental formulation of  damage accumulation: 
∆|u1D437 =DMGEXP×|u1D437|parenleftCv4|oneCst−|oneCst
DMGEXP |parenriµhtCv4
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst 
where, 
|u1D437 Damage value  (0 ≤ |u1D437 ≤ 1).  For numerical reasons, |u1D437 is initialized to a 
value of 10 -20  for all damage types in the ﬁrst time step. 
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st Equivalent plastic strain to failure, determined f rom LCSDG as a function 
of the current triaxiality value |u1D7≠2 (and Lode parameter /u1D4:F as an option). 
A typical failure curve LCSDG for metal sheet, mode lled with shell ele- 
ments is shown in Figure 2-3 . Triaxiality should be monotonically increas- 
ing in this curve.  A reasonable range for triaxial ity is -2/3 to 2/3 if shell 
elements are used (plane stress). 
For 3-dimensional stress states (solid elements), t he possible range of tri- 
axiality goes from −∞ to +∞, but to get a good resolution in the internal 
load curve discretization (depending on parameter L CINT of *CON-
TROL_SOLUTION) you should deﬁne lower limits, such as -1 to 1 if 
LCINT = 100 (default). 
 ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst Equivalent plastic strain increment 
 
For constant values of failure strain, this damage rate can be integrated to get a relation 
of damage and actual equivalent plastic strain:

LS-DYNA R13 2-67 (MAT) Triaxiality, |u1D7≠2, as a measure of the current stress state is deﬁned as 
|u1D7≠2 =|u1D7≠∆|u1D43BCst
|u1D7≠∆/u1D440.st  , 
with hydrostatic stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D43BCst, and von Mises stress, |u1D7≠∆/u1D440.st. Lode parameter /u1D4:F as an additional 
measure of the current stress state is deﬁned as 
/u1D4:F=2 7
2/u1D4:D|threeCst
|u1D7≠∆/u1D440.st|threeCst  , 
with third invariant of the stress deviator, /u1D4:D|threeCst.  
 
For DTYP = 0, damage is accumulated according to th e description above, yet no 
softening and failure is taken into account.  Thus,  parameters ECRIT, DCRIT and FAD-
EXP will not have any inﬂuence.  This option can be  used to calculate pre-damage in 
multi-stage deformations without inﬂuencing the sim ulation results. 
 
For DTYPE = 1, elements will be deleted if |u1D437 ≥ 1.  
 
Depending on the set of parameters given by ECRIT ( or DCRIT) and FADEXP, a 
Lemaitre-type coupling of damage and stress (eﬀective stress concept)  can be used. 
Three principal ways to deﬁne damage can be used: 
1.  Input of a ﬁxed value of critical plastic strain ( ECRIT > 0.). As soon as the 
magnitude of plastic strain reaches this value, the  current damage parameter |u1D437 
is stored as critical damage DCRIT and the damage c oupling ﬂag is set to uni- 
ty, in order to facilitate an identiﬁcation of crit ical elements in post-processing.  
From this point on, damage is coupled to the stress  tensor using the following 
relation: 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D7≠∆̃ 
⎣⎢⎡1 − |parenleftCvJ|u1D437 − DCRIT 
1 − DCRIT |parenriµhtCvJFADEXP 
⎦⎥⎤ 
This leads to a continuous reduction of stress, up to the load-bearing capacity 
completely vanishing as |u1D437 reaches unity.  The fading exponent FADEXP can be 
element size dependent to allow for the considerati on of an element-size de- 
pendent amount of energy to be dissipated during el ement fade-out. 
2.  Input of a load curve deﬁning critical plastic str ain as a function of triaxiality 
(ECRIT < 0.), pointing to load curve ID |ECRIT| . This allows for a deﬁnition of 
triaxiality-dependent material instability, which t akes account of instability 
and localization occurring depending on the actual load case.  One possibility 
is the use of instability curves predicted by insta bility models (e.g., Swift, Hill, 
Marciniak-Kuczynski, etc.). Another possibility is the use of a transformed 
Forming Limit Diagram as an input for the expected onset of softening and 
localization.  Using this load curve, the instabili ty measure |u1D439 is accumulated *MAT  *MAT_ADD_DAMAGE_GISSMO  
2-68 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 using the following relation, which is similar to t he accumulation of damage |u1D437 
except for the instability curve is used as an inpu t: 
∆|u1D439 =DMGEXP 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J9Cst /u1D45C.st|u1D4J≠Cst |u1D439|parenleftCv4|oneCst−|oneCst
DMGEXP |parenriµhtCv4∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst 
with, 
 |u1D439 Instability measure ( 0 ≤ |u1D439 ≤ 1 ).  
 |u1D7≠≠p,loc  Equivalent plastic strain to instability, determin ed from ECRIT 
 ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst Equivalent plastic strain increment 
As soon as the instability measure |u1D439 reaches unity, the current value of damage 
|u1D437 in the respective element is stored.  Damage will from this point on be cou- 
pled to the ﬂow stress using the relation described  above. 
3.  If no input for ECRIT is made, parameter DCRIT wil l be considered.  Coupling 
of damage to the stress tensor starts if this value  (damage threshold) is exceeded 
(0 ≤ DCRIT ≤ 1).  Coupling of damage to stress is d one using the relation de- 
scribed above. 
This input allows for the use of extreme values als o – for example, DCRIT = 1.0 
would lead to no coupling at all, and element delet ion under full load (brittle 
fracture). 
 
The values of SHRF and BIAXF generally lie between 0.0 and 1.0 where 0.0 means full 
regularization and 1.0 means no regularization unde r shear (triaxiality = 0.0 for 
SHRF = 1.0) or biaxial tension (triaxiality = 2/3 f or BIAXF = 1.0).  Any other 
intermediate triaxiality follows a linear interpola tion between triaxiality 0.0 and 1/3 and 
also between triaxiality 1/3 and 2/3. Notice that a  full regularization is always 
undertaken for a one-dimensional tensile stress sta te (triaxiality = 1/3) according to the 
factors deﬁned under LCREGD. For the sake of genera lization, both SHRF and BIAXF 
can also assume negative values (e.g., SHRF = -1.0 and BIAXF = -1.0).  In this case, 
regularization is aﬀected not at triaxialities 0.0 and 2/3 but rather at the triaxialities 
where the failure curve (LCSDG) crosses the instabi lity curve (-ECRIT).  The use of a 
triaxiality-dependent regularization approach may b e necessary because simple 
regularization only depending on the element size c an be unrealistic for certain stress 
states. 
If the results of a ﬁrst simulation should be trans ferred to a second computation with 
potentially modiﬁed mesh size, such as mapping from  forming to crash, it might be 
necessary to alter damage values (and maybe plastic  strain) as well.  For that purpose, 
reference element size REFSZ can be deﬁned.  With R EFSZ  >  0, corresponding damage 
is computed in the same fashion as the actual damag e, just with the given reference 
element size instead, and written to history variab le ND + 9. An alternative approach is *MAT_ADD_DAMAGE_GISSMO  *MAT  
LS-DYNA R13 2-69 (MAT) available with the deﬁnition of REFSZ  <  0. In tha t case, a plastic strain with regard to 
|REFS Z | is computed ﬁrst:  
∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|/R.st/E.st/F.st/S.st/Z.st |=∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/u1D45:.st(|REFS Z |) − |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/E.st/C.st/R.st/∆.st/ε.st 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/u1D45:.st(/u1D45∫|u1D4J2Cst) − |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/E.st/C.st/R.st/∆.st/ε.st             (if |u1D439 ≥ 1) 
The accumulated value of that is written to history  variable ND + 17. Afterwards, 
damage with respect to the |REFS Z | is computed similarly to the standard damage 
accumulation, only using this new reference plastic  strain: 
∆|u1D437|/R.st/E.st/F.st/S.st/Z.st |=DMGEXP×(|u1D437|/R.st/E.st/F.st/S.st/Z.st |)|parenleftCv4|oneCst−|oneCst
DMGEXP |parenriµhtCv4
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/u1D45:.st(|REFS Z |)∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|/R.st/E.st/F.st/S.st/Z.st | 
This “reference damage” is stored on history variab le ND + 9. 
History Variables: 
History variables of the GISSMO damage model are wr itten to the post-processing 
database.  Therefore, NEIPH and NEIPS must be set i n *DATABASE_EXTENT_-BINA-
RY.  The damage history variables start at position  ND, which is displayed in d3hsp  ﬁle 
as, for example, “ﬁrst damage history variable = 6”  which means that ND = 6.  For 
example, if you wish to view the damage parameter ( ﬁrst GISSMO history variable) for 
a *MAT_024 shell element, you must set NEIPS = 6.  In LS-PrePost, you access the 
damage parameter as history variable #6.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation for which this erosion deﬁni tion applies.  
A unique number or label must be speciﬁed (see *PAR T). 
EXCL The exclusion number (default value of 0.0 is recom mended).  For 
any failure value in *MAT_ADD_EROSION which is set to this 
exclusion number, the associated failure criterion is not invoked.  
Or in other words, only the failure values which ar e not set to the 
exclusion number are invoked.  The default value of  EX CL (0.0) 
eliminates from consideration any failure criterion  who se failure 
value is left blank or set to 0.0.   
As an example, to prevent a material from developin g tensile 
pressure, the user could specify an unusual value f or the 
exclusion number, such as 1234, set MN PRES to 0.0, and set all 
the other failure values in *MAT_ADD_ERO SION to 1234.  
However, use of an exclusion number in this way is nonessential 
since the same eﬀect could be achieved without use of the 
exclusion number by setting MN PRES to a very small negative 
value and leaving all the other failure values blank (or set to 
zero).    
MXPRES Maximum pressure at failure, |u1D443|mCst|aCst|xCst .  If the value is exactly zero, it 
is automatically excluded to maintain compatibility  with old 
input ﬁles. 
MNEPS Minimum principal strain at failure, |u1D7≠≠|mCst|iCst|nCst .  If the value is e xactly 
zero, it is automatically excluded to maintain comp atibility with 
old input ﬁles. *MAT_ADD_EROSION  *MAT

If the value is exactly zero, it is automatically e xcluded to 
maintain compatibility with old input ﬁles.  If the  value is 
negative, then |EFFEPS|  is the eﬀective plastic strain at failure.  In 
combination with cohesive elements, EF FEPS is the maximum 
eﬀective in-plane strain.

whether the failure is in tension or compression, r espectively.  If 
the value is exactly zero, it is automatically excluded to maintain 
compatibility with old input ﬁles.

GT.0.0: Number of integration points which must fail before  
element is deleted  
LT.0.0: Applies only to shells. |N U MFIP|  is the percentage of 
integration points which must exceed the failure cr ite- 
rion before the element fails.  If NUMFIP < - 100, then 
|N U MFIP|-100  is the number of failed integration 
points prior to element deletion. 
NCS Number of failure conditions to satisfy before fail ure occurs.  For 
example, if SIGP1 and SIGVM are deﬁned and if NCS =  2, both 
failure criteria must be met before element deletio n can occur.  
The default is set to unity.

Remarks: 
1.  Failure Criteria.   In addition to failure time, supported criteria f or failure are: 
a)  |u1D443 ≥ |u1D443max , where |u1D443 is the pressure (positive in compression), and |u1D443|mCst|aCst|xCst  is 
the maximum pressure at failure 
b)  |u1D7≠≠|threeCst≤ |u1D7≠≠|mCst|iCst|nCst , where |u1D7≠≠|threeCst is the minimum principal strain, and |u1D7≠≠|mCst|iCst|nCst  is the mini- 
mum principal strain at failure 
c)  |u1D443 ≤ |u1D443|mCst|iCst|nCst , where |u1D443 is the pressure (positive in compression), and |u1D443|mCst|iCst|nCst  is 
the minimum pressure at failure 
d)  |u1D7≠∆|oneCst≥ |u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst|xCst , where |u1D7≠∆|oneCst is the maximum principal stress, and |u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst|xCst  is the 
maximum principal stress at failure 
e)  /radical.v:|threeCst
|twoCst|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst≥ |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|mCst|aCst|xCst , where |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst are the deviatoric stress components, and |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|mCst|aCst|xCst  
is the equivalent stress at failure 
f)  |u1D7≠≠|oneCst≥ |u1D7≠≠|mCst|aCst|xCst , where |u1D7≠≠|oneCst is the maximum principal strain, and |u1D7≠≠|mCst|aCst|xCst  is the max- 
imum principal strain at failure 
g)  |u1D6F∆|oneCst≥ |u1D6F∆|mCst|aCst|xCst /2, where |u1D6F∆|oneCst is the maximum tensorial shear strain = (|u1D7≠≠|oneCst− |u1D7≠≠|threeCst)/

where |u1D7≠∆|oneCst is the maximum principal stress, |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst is a speciﬁed threshold 
stress, |u1D7≠∆|oneCst≥ |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst≥ 0, and K/f.st is the stress impulse for failure.  Stress values *MAT  *MAT_ADD_EROSION  
2-78 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 below the threshold value are too low to cause frac ture even for very long 
duration loadings. 
i)  A nonlocal failure criterion which is mainly inten ded for windshield im- 
pact can be deﬁned using ENGCRT, RADCRT, and one ad ditional “main” 
failure criterion (only SIGP1 is available at the m oment).  All three param- 
eters should be deﬁned for one part, namely the win dshield glass and the 
glass should be discretized with shell elements.  T he course of events of 
this nonlocal failure model is as follows: If the m ain failure criterion SIGP1 
is fulﬁlled, the corresponding element is ﬂagged as  center of impact, but 
no element erosion takes place yet.  Then, the inte rnal energy of shells in- 
side a circle, deﬁned by RADCRT, around the center of impact is tested 
against the product of the given critical energy EN GCRT and the “area 
factor”.  The area factor is deﬁned as, 
Area Factor =total area of shell elements found inside the circl e 
2/u1D̅0B× RADCRT |twoCst 
The reason for having two times the circle area in the denominator is that 
we expect two layers of shell elements, as would ty pically be the case for 
laminated windshield glass.  If this energy criteri on is exceeded, all ele- 
ments of the part are now allowed to be eroded by t he main failure crite- 
rion. 
j)  An element size dependent mixed-mode fracture crit erion (MMFC) can be 
deﬁned for shell elements using load curves LCEPS12 , LCEPS23, and 
LCEPSMX.  Failure happens if NCS (see Card 1) of th ese three criteria are 
met 
LCEPS12 :    |u1D6F∆|oneCst|twoCst =|oneCst
|twoCst(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst− |u1D7≠≠|twoCst) ≥ |u1D6F∆|oneCst|twoCst |u1D4J≠Cst(/u1D45∫|u1D4J2Cst)     if    − 2.0 ≤ |u1D7≠≠|twoCst|u1D7≠≠|oneCst⁄ ≤ −0.5
LCEPS13 :    |u1D6F∆|oneCst|threeCst =|oneCst
|twoCst(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst− |u1D7≠≠|threeCst) ≥ |u1D6F∆|oneCst|threeCst |u1D4J≠Cst(/u1D45∫|u1D4J2Cst)   if    − 0.5 ≤ |u1D7≠≠|twoCst|u1D7≠≠|oneCst⁄ ≤ 1.0
LCEPSMX :    |u1D7≠≠|oneCst≥ |u1D7≠≠|oneCst|u1D4J≠Cst(/u1D45∫|u1D4J2Cst)            if    − 0.5 ≤ |u1D7≠≠|twoCst|u1D7≠≠|oneCst⁄ ≤ 1.0 
where |u1D6F∆|oneCst|twoCst  and |u1D6F∆|oneCst|threeCst  are in-plane and through-thickness shear strains, |u1D7≠≠|oneCst and 
|u1D7≠≠|twoCst are in-plane major and minor strains, and |u1D7≠≠|threeCst is the through-thickness 
strain.  The characteristic element size is /u1D45∫|u1D4J2Cst and it is computed as the 
square root of the shell element area.  More detail s can be found in Zhu & 
Zhu (2011). 
2.  NUMFIP.   Element erosion depends on the type of element an d the value of 
NUMFIP. 
a)  When NUMFIP > 0, elements erode when NUMFIP points  fail.  
b)  For shells only, when -100 ≤ NUMFIP < 0, elements erode when |N U MFIP|  
percent of the integration points fail.   *MAT_ADD_EROSION  *MAT  
LS-DYNA R13 2-79 (MAT) c)  For shells only, when NUMFIP < -100, elements erod e when  |N U MFIP| −
100  integration points fail.   
For NUMFIP > 0 and -100 ≤ NUMFIP < 0, layers retain  full strength until the 
element is eroded.  For NUMFIP < -100, the stress a t an integration point im- 
mediately drops to zero when failure is detected at  that integration point. 
3.  Instability.   If the keyword *DEFINE_MATERIAL_HISTORIES is used  to 
output the instability, the following table gives a  summary of the output prop- 
erties.  Currently only failure values based on the  ﬁrst two cards of this key- 
word are supported but others can be added on reque st; for the unsupported 
options the output will be zero.  The instability v alue is deﬁned as the quantity 
of interest divided by its corresponding upper limi t (restricted to be positive).

4.  VOLFRAC.   The volumes associated with individual integratio n points in 
higher order ﬁnite elements and isogeometric elemen ts varies widely.  Thus, 
the number of failed integration points is not a re liable criterion for determin- 
ing element failure.  To obtain a more stable and c onsistent response, LS-DY-
NA uses the volume fraction of the failed material for these types of elements. *MAT  *MAT_ADD_FATIGUE

Remarks: 
1.  S-N Curves.   For fatigue analysis based on stress (OPTION = <B LANK>), S-N 
curves can be deﬁned by *DEFINE_CURVE or by a prede ﬁned equation.  
There are 4 diﬀerent predeﬁned equations: 
a)  LCID = -1 : 
/u1D441|u1D446|u1D44FCst= |u1D44∆ 
b)  LCID = -2 : 
log(|u1D446) = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F log( /u1D441) 
c)  LCID  =  -3 : 
|u1D446 = |u1D44∆ /u1D441|u1D44FCst 
d)  LCID = -4 : 
|u1D446 = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F log(/u1D441) 
Here /u1D441 is the number of cycles for fatigue failure and |u1D446 is the stress amplitude.  
Note that the two equations can be converted to eac h other, with some minor 
algebraic manipulation on the constants |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F. 
To deﬁne an S-N curve with multiple slopes, the S-N  curve can be split into 
multiple segments with each segment deﬁned by a set  of parameters A i, B i and *MAT_ADD_FATIGUE  *MAT  
LS-DYNA R13 2-85 (MAT) STHRES i. Up to 8 sets of the parameters (A i, B i and STHRES i) can be deﬁned.  
The lower limit of the ith  segment is represented by the threshold stress 
STHRES i, as shown in Figure 2-4 . This only applies to the case where LCID < 0.   
2.  Related Keywords.   This model is applicable to frequency domain fati gue 
analysis, deﬁned by the keywords: *FREQUENCY_DOMAIN _RANDOM_VI-
BRATION_FATIGUE and *FREQUENCY_DOMAIN_SSD_FATIGUE.  It also 
applies to time domain fatigue analysis, deﬁned by the keyword *FATIGUE 
(see these keywords for further details).

2-86 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 *MAT_ADD_GENERALIZED_DAMAGE  
This option provides a way of including generalized  (tensor type) damage and failure 
in standard LS-DYNA material models.  The basic ide a is to apply a general damage 
model (e.g. GISSMO) using several history variables  as damage driving quantities at the 
same time.  With this feature it may be possible to  obtain, for example, anisotropic 
damage behavior or separate stress degradation for volumetric and deviatoric 
deformations.  A maximum of three simultaneous dama ge evolutions (meaning 
deﬁnition of 3 history variables) is possible.  A d etailed description of this model can be 
found in Erhart et al.  [2017].  
 
This option currently applies to shell element type s 1, 2, 3, 4, 16, and 17 and solid 
element types -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 13, 15, 16, a nd 17.

value” in the following:  
EQ.0: Equivalent plastic strain rate is the driving quant ity for 
the damage if IFLG1 = 0. Alternatively, if IFLG1 = 1, 
components of the plastic strain rate tensor are driving 
quantities for damage (see Remarks 2  and 3).

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCSRS Load curve ID deﬁning failure history value scaling  factor for 
LCS DG as a function of history value rate.  If the ﬁrs t rate value in 
the curve is negative, it is assumed that all rate values are given 
as natural logarithm of the history rate. 
GT.0: Scale ECRIT as well. 
LT.0: Do not scale ECRIT. 
SHRF Reduction factors for regularization at triaxi ality = 0 (shear) 
BIAXF Reduction factors for regularization at triax iality = 2/3 (biaxial) 
LCDLIM Load curve ID deﬁning damage limit values as a func tion of 
triaxiality.  Damage can be restricted to values le ss than 1.0 to 
prevent further stress reduction and failure for ce rtain 
triaxialities. 
MIDFAIL Mid-plane failure option for shell elements .  If active, then critical 
strain is only checked at the mid- plane integration point, meaning 
an odd number for NIP should be used.  Damage is co mputed at *MAT  *MAT_ADD_GENERALIZED_DAMAGE

the other integration points, but no coupling to th e stresses is 
done ﬁrst.  As soon as the mid-plane IP reaches ECRIT/DCRIT, 
then all the other IPs are also checked (exception:  MIDFAIL = 4).  
EQ.0.0: Inactive 
EQ.1.0: Active. The stresses immediately begin to reduce for 
non-mid- plane IPs that are already above their critical 
value.  Coupling only occurs for IPs that reach the ir cri- 
terion.   
EQ.2.0: Active. The stresses immediately begin to reduce for all 
the non-mid-plane IPs.  NUMFIP is active. 
EQ.3.0: Active. Same as 2, but when D = 1 is reached in the 
middle integration point, the element is eroded ins tan- 
taneously.  NUMFIP is disregarded.  
EQ.4.0: Active. Damage and failure is applied only on the 
midpoint.  When D = 1 on the midpoint, the element is 
eroded.  NUM FIP is disregarded.  Integration points 
away from the midplane see no stress reduction and no 
failure. 
NFLOC Optional “local” number of failed integration point s prior to 
element deletion.  Overwrites the deﬁnition of NUM FIP for 
history variable HIS n. 
Remarks: 
1.  Comparison to GISSMO Damage Model.   The GISSMO damage model is 
described in detail in the remarks of *MAT_ADD_DAMA GE_GISSMO.  If 
NHIS = 1 and HIS1 = 0 is used, this keyword behaves  the same as GISSMO. 
The main diﬀerence between this keyword and GISSMO is that up to 3 inde- 
pendent but simultaneous damage evolutions are poss ible.  Therefore, parame- 
ters LCSDG, ECRIT, DMGEXP, DCRIT, FADEXP, LCREGD, L CSRS, SHRF, BI-
AXF, and LCDLIM can be deﬁned separately for each h istory variable. *MAT_ADD_GENERALIZED_DAMAGE  *MAT

3.  History Variables.   The increment of the damage parameter is computed i n 
GISSMO based on a driving quantity that has the dim ension of a strain rate:

epf  
The history variables deﬁned by the user through HI S i should thus have the 
dimension of a strain as the rate is computed inter nally by 
MAT_ADD_GENERALIZED_DAMAGE:

Remarks: 
General 
 
The resulting stress from an integration point with  inelasticities is the sum of the stress 
/u1D̅48/u1D4:C.st from each link, weighed by its weight, |u1D464/u1D4:C.st (see WEIGHT above).  A link in this 
context can also be referred to as a network or a p hase, depending on the physical 
interpretation, and we use the subscript /u1D4:C to refer to a speciﬁc one.  So, the stress, /u1D̅48, is in 
the end given by 
/u1D̅48= |summationCv1 |u1D464/u1D4:C.st/u1D̅48/u1D4:C.stNIELINKS(+|oneCst)
/u1D4:C.st=|oneCst  . 
The data for the links are speciﬁed by the user, ex cept for a possible last one which is 
internally created if the weights do not sum to uni ty (whence the +1 in the number of 
terms in the sum above).  This last link will get i ts stress /u1D̅48NIELINKS+|oneCst  only from the 
material model without any inelasticities, and its weight will be 
|u1D464NIELINKS+|oneCst = 1 − |summationCv1 |u1D464/u1D4:C.stNIELINKS 
/u1D4:C.st=|oneCst  , 
that is, just enough for the total weight to sum to  1. The stress for each link will be 
treated next, for which we drop the subscript /u1D4:C for the sake of clarity, and emphasize 
that this ﬁrst part will only treat creep and plast icity, since viscoelasticity is somewhat 
diﬀerent and explained on its own at the end of thi s section.

Inﬁnitesimal description 
 
The inelasticity feature assumes that the strain or  strain rate is somehow decomposed 
into an elastic and inelastic part.  This decomposi tion is in general not trivial and 
depends upon the underlying material model, but to make things simple we can begin 
by restricting ourselves to a small deformation con text.  In this case the decomposition 
is additive , so 
/u1D̅:A=/u1D̅:A|u1D4J2Cst+/u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst  , 
where /u1D̅:A is the total  (given) strain, /u1D̅:A|u1D4J2Cst is the elastic  strain, and /u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst is the inelastic  strain.  A 
material model then amounts to determining the stre ss for the elastic strain, which can 
be written as 
/u1D̅48=/u1D̅48(/u1D̅:A|u1D4J2Cst) =/u1D̅48(/u1D̅:A−/u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst). 
The material model used as a basis for this feature , that is, the model indicated by 
parameter MID above, here acts as the function /u1D̅48(∗). If no inelasticity is added to the 
model, /u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst=/u1D̅CE and the stress will be given by /u1D̅48(/u1D̅:A). It is simply a plain evaluation of the 
material model in the absence of this keyword.  For  linear elasticity, for instance, the 
function would be given by Hooke’s law 
/u1D̅48(/u1D̅:A) =/u1D46A/u1D̅:A  , 
where /u1D46A is the Hooke elasticity tensor.  Needless to say, the material model itself can 
deal with inelasticities of various kinds, such as plasticity, creep, thermal expansion and 
viscoelasticity, so the variable /u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst is restricted to the inelasticities speciﬁcally de ﬁned here ...

LS-DYNA R13 2-107 (MAT) and thus added to whatever is used in the material model.  For the sake of generality, 
we allow the inelastic strain to come from many sou rces and be combined: 
/u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst=/u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst|oneCst+/u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst|twoCst+/u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst|threeCst+⋯  . 
Here each superscript on the right-hand side refers  to a speciﬁc combination of LAW 
and MODEL (excluding viscoelastic laws). 
 
Large strain formulation 
 
For incrementally updated material models, using hy poelasticity with an objective rate 
of stress, the exposition above is generalized to l arge deformations by applying the 
appropriate time derivative to strains and stresses : 
/u1D̅:A→/u1D46B ,/u1D̅:A|u1D4J2Cst→/u1D46B|u1D4J2Cst,/u1D̅:A|u1D4J6Cst→/u1D46B|u1D4J6Cst,/u1D̅48→/u1D̅48/u1D6FB.st,… 
Here /u1D46B is the rate of deformation tensor, and /u1D6FB indicates an objective time derivative 3. 
For now, we restrict the evolution of inelastic str ain to be based on a von Mises stress 
potential: 
/u1D46B|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst= |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D71J|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt
|u1D71J/u1D̅48  , 
where 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt=/radical.v53
2/u1D4∫4:/u1D4∫4   |parenleftCvJ/u1D4∫4=/u1D̅48−1
3/u1D̅48:/u1D4̅0|parenriµhtCvJ 
is the von Mises eﬀective stress, and |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst is the rate of eﬀective inelastic strain for the 
MODEL and LAW corresponding to superscript /u1D45̅. The constitutive law is thus written 
as 
/u1D̅48/u1D6FB.st=/u1D̅48/u1D6FB.st(/u1D46B|u1D4J2Cst) =  /u1D̅48/u1D6FB.st(/u1D46B−/u1D46B|u1D4J6Cst)  . 
For hyperelastic materials the role of /u1D46B|u1D4J2Cst is replaced by the elastic deformation gradient,  /u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst, 
and instead of a constitutive law for the rate of s tress, the total stress is given as 
/u1D̅48=/u1D̅48(/u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst)  . 
The evolution of the elastic deformation gradient i s taken as 
/u1D46Ḋ|u1D4J2Cst= (/u1D4̅:−/u1D4̅:|u1D4J6Cst)/u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst  , 
where /u1D4̅:=/u1D̅15.st/u1D4∫̅
/u1D̅15.st/u1D4∫∫ is the spatial velocity gradient  and /u1D4̅:|u1D4J6Cst is the inelastic part.  For simplicity, we 
assume zero plastic spin for all involved features,  thus /u1D4̅E|u1D4J6Cst=/u1D̅CE and /u1D4̅:|u1D4J6Cst=/u1D46B|u1D4J6Cst.  
 
From here, we will give the evolution law of the eﬀ ective inelastic strain for the 
available contributions.

In other words, it is the classical von Mises plast icity available in many standard

Creep (LAW = 5) 
 
For creep, the inelastic strain is represented by t he creep strain, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J≠Cst. The evolution 
depends on the model speciﬁed.

Here |u1D447 is the current temperature. 
 
Viscoelasticity 
 
In the absence of viscoelasticity, we are now done with the description of the stress 
update, and we simply set 
/u1D4∫4/u1D4:C.st=/u1D4∫4
|u1D4JD/u1D4:C.st= |u1D4JD 
where we use /u1D4∫4/u1D4:C.st and |u1D4JD/u1D4:C.st to denote the ﬁnal deviatoric stress and pressure in link /u1D4:C that is 
used in the weighted sum at the beginning of this s ection.  The /u1D4∫4 and |u1D4JD are to be 
understood as the deviatoric stress and pressure re sulting from treatment of creep and 
plasticity that we just covered, so /u1D̅48=/u1D4∫4− |u1D4JD/u1D4̅0. For viscoelasticity the stress in link /u1D4:C will 
be subject to stress decay (relaxation and creep), in that it evolves according to the 
speciﬁed viscoelastic law.  For deviatoric and volu metric decay coeﬃcients |u1D6FD|u1D46≠Cst and |u1D6FD|u1D4JDCst, 
we have for the hypoelastic law (MODEL = 1) 
/u1D4∫4/u1D4:C.st/na˙la.st=/u1D4∫4/na˙la.st− |u1D6FD|u1D46≠Cst/u1D4∫4/u1D4:C.st
|u1D4JḊ/u1D4:C.st= |u1D4JḊ− |u1D6FD|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JD/u1D4:C.st 
The hyperelastic laws are formulated directly in te rms of the Kirchhoﬀ stress /u1D̅4∫=/u1D4:D/u1D̅48, 
where /u1D4:D= det /u1D46D. More speciﬁcally, using the notation /u1D45E= −|oneCst
|threeCst/u1D̅4∫:/u1D4̅0 and /u1D4∫5=/u1D̅4∫+/u1D45E/u1D4̅0, we

The Kirchhoﬀ stress for link /u1D4:C is obtained as /u1D̅4∫/u1D4:C.st=/u1D4∫5/u1D4:C.st−/u1D45E/u1D4:C.st/u1D4̅0. Here we use /u1D46D̅|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst=/u1D4:D|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst−|oneCst/|threeCst/u1D46D|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst, 
where /u1D4:D|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst= det /u1D46D|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst, and /u1D46D|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst is the deformation gradient between the conﬁgurati on at 
time |u1D46≠ and time |u1D461. For law #1, /u1D46D̅|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst is used to push the stress forward from time |u1D46≠ to time 
|u1D461, while for law #2, /u1D46D|u1D46≠Cst→|u1D461Cst is used to transform the stress from time |u1D46≠ to time |u1D461, both 
essential to preserve frame invariance. 
 
The decay coeﬃcients can be constants but can also dependent on the state of the 
system (stress, internal variables, temperature, et c.). Note that if the decay coeﬃcients 
are equal to zero ( |u1D6FD|u1D46≠Cst= |u1D6FD|u1D4JDCst= 0), this is equivalent to not having viscoelasticity .  
Currently, we can specify temperature dependent dec ay coeﬃcients to aﬀect both the 
deviatoric and volumetric stress, formalized in the  following. 
 
Viscoelasticity (LAW = 6) 
 
For viscoelasticity, the decay of stress is governe d by the decay coeﬃcients |u1D6FD|u1D46≠Cst and |u1D6FD|u1D4JDCst, 
optionally incorporating shift functions depending on the temperature |u1D447. In this 
implementation, the shear and bulk decay are given as 
|u1D6FD|u1D46≠Cst= |u1D6FD/u1D4:A.st/u1D̅1∫/u1D4:A.st(|u1D447)
|u1D6FD|u1D4JDCst= |u1D6FD/u1D4:E.st/u1D̅1∫/u1D4:E.st(|u1D447) 
where /u1D̅1∫∗ (∗ being |u1D43A or |u1D43∆) are shift functions given by 
/u1D̅1∫∗(|u1D447) =
⎩|<raceleftCex|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex|<raceleftCex⎧

|u1D43JCst∗+|u1D447Cst−|u1D447Cst∗|parenriµhtCvJif |u1D43J∗≠ 0 (Williams − Landel − Ferry) 
 
This is essentially the viscoelastic law available in *MAT_GENERAL_VISCOELASTIC 
(*MAT_076), except that the driving mechanism for t he stress is here /u1D4∫4/na˙la.st and |u1D4JḊ rather 
than 2|u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D46B/d.st |eCst|vCst  and |u1D43∆/u1D4:C.st|u1D437v ol . Note also, that in contrast to *MAT_076, the shif t coeﬃcients 
are to be given for each link and for both the shea r and bulk decay.  This allows for 
using independent shifts for each link, and if the traditional usage of the shift functions 
is desired one needs to put the same triplet (i.e.,  the values of |u1D447∗, |u1D434∗ and |u1D43J∗) on all links 
(parameters P3-P5 for shear, and P6-P8 for bulk).  If *MAT_ELASTIC is used in 
combination with viscoelasticity here, the two form ulations can be made (almost) 
equivalent after proper transformation of input dat a.  For instance, the following two 
material deﬁnitions (1 and 2) are equivalent;

in *MAT_ELASTIC, and |u1D43A/u1D4:C.st and |u1D43∆/u1D4:C.st in *MAT_GENERAL_VISCOELASTIC, we have 
|u1D43A = |summationCv1 |u1D43A/u1D4:C.st,         |u1D43∆ = |summationCv1 |u1D43∆/u1D4:C.st

which implies that the add inelasticity approach is  somewhat more restrictive than the 
general approach.  However, an almost pure shear/bu lk link can be created by setting 
the bulk/shear decay coeﬃcient to a very large numb er compared to the simulation 
time.  To be speciﬁc, to get a shear link set |u1D6FD/u1D4:E.st≫1/|u1D447 and to get a bulk link set |u1D6FD/u1D4:A.st≫1/
|u1D447, where |u1D447 is the termination time.  See also VFLAG in *MAT_G ENERAL_HYPERE-

2-114 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
a function of eﬀective pressure ( |u1D46J-axis) which is posi- 
tive when in compression . 
Remarks: 
1.  Permeability Units.  The units of PERM are length/time (volume ﬂow rate of 
water per unit area per gradient of pore pressure h ead). 
2.  Thermal Expansion.  THEXP represents the thermal expansion of the mater ial 
caused by the pore ﬂuid (units: 1/temperature). It should be set equal to |u1D4JB|u1D6F+|u1D464Cst, 
where |u1D4JB is the porosity of the soil and |u1D6F+|u1D464Cst is the volumetric thermal expansion 
coeﬃcient of the pore ﬂuid.  If the pore ﬂuid is wa ter, the thermal expansion 
coeﬃcient varies strongly with temperature; a curve  of coeﬃcient as a function 
of temperature may be input instead of a constant v alue. Note that this proper- 
ty is for volumetric  strain increase, whereas regular thermal expansion  coeﬃ- 
cients (e.g. on *MAT or *MAT_ADD_THERMAL_EXPANSION)  are linear, 
meaning they describe thermal expansion in one dire ction.  The volumetric 
expansion coeﬃcient is three times the linear therm al expansion coeﬃcient.  
The regular thermal expansion coeﬃcients apply to t he soil skeleton and to 
drained parts.  Pore pressure can be generated due to the diﬀerence of expan- 
sion coeﬃcients of the soil skeleton and pore ﬂuid,  that is, if THEXP is not 
equal to three times the regular thermal expansion coeﬃcient for the part. *MAT_ADD_PORE_AIR  *MAT

LCPGD i Curves deﬁning non-linear Darcy’s laws along |u1D46J, |u1D466 and /u1D46̅-
directions 
Remarks: 
1.  Card 1.   This card must be deﬁned for all materials requir ing consideration of 
pore air pressure.  The pressure contribution of po re air is |parenleftCv1|u1D7≠+ − |u1D7≠+atm |parenriµhtCv1RT ×
PORE , where |u1D7≠+ and |u1D7≠+atm  are the current and atmospheric air densities, |u1D44J is air’s 
gas constant, |u1D447 is atmospheric air temperature and PORE is the por osity.  The 
values for |u1D44J, |u1D447 and PORE are assumed to be constant during simulat ion. 
2.  Permeability Model.   The unit of PERM i is |<racketleftCv1Length|<racketriµhtCv1|threeCst[time]/[mass] , (air ﬂow 
velocity per gradient of excess pore pressure), i.e . 
(CDARC Y + CDF × ||u1D463|u1D4J6Cst|) × PORE × |u1D463|u1D4J6Cst= PERM|u1D4J6 ×|u1D71J|u1D443|u1D44∆Cst
|u1D71J|u1D46J|u1D4J6Cst, |u1D4J6 = 1,2,3 
where |u1D463i is the pore air ﬂow velocity along the ith  direction, |u1D71J|u1D443|u1D44∆Cst/|u1D71J|u1D46J|u1D4J6Cst is the pore 
air pressure gradient along the i th  direction, and |u1D46J|oneCst= |u1D46J, |u1D46J|twoCst= |u1D466, |u1D46J|threeCst=/u1D46̅. 
3.  Default Values for PERM2 and PERM3.   PERM2 and PERM3 are assumed to 
be equal to PERM1 when they are not deﬁned.  A deﬁn ition of “0” means no 
permeability. 
4.  Local Coordinate Systems.   When MID is an orthotropic material, such as 
*MAT_002 or *MAT_142, |parenleftCv1|u1D46J, |u1D466,/u1D46̅|parenriµhtCv1, or (1,2,3) , refers to the local material coordi- 
nate system (|u1D44∆, |u1D44F,/u1D450); otherwise it refers to the global coordinate syst em. 
5.  CDF for Viscosity.   CDF can be used to consider the viscosity eﬀect f or high 
speed air ﬂow. 
6.  Nonlinearity.   LCPGD i can be used to deﬁne a non-linear Darcy’s law as 
follows: 
(CDARC Y + CDF × ||u1D463|u1D4J6Cst|) × PORE × |u1D463|u1D4J6Cst= PERM|u1D4J6 × |u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst|u1D71J|u1D443|u1D44∆Cst
|u1D71J|u1D46J|u1D4J6Cst, |u1D4J6 = 1,2,3 
where |u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst is the value of the function deﬁned by the LCPGD i ﬁeld.  The linear 
version of Darcy’s law (see Remark 2 ) can be recovered when the LCPGD i 
curves are deﬁned as straight lines of slope of 1. *MAT_ADD_PROPERTY_DEPENDENCE  *MAT

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation for which the property d ependence applies  
PROP Name of the property (same as the variable for a ma terial model 
in keyword card).  For example, “E” is used for You ng’s modulus 
in *MAT_ELASTIC.  See Remark 4 . 
LCID Curve ID to deﬁne the property d ependence.  For the FREQ 
keyword option, the abscissa values deﬁne frequency ; for the 
TIME keyword option, the abscissa values deﬁne time .  The 
ordinate values deﬁne the property at each frequenc y or each 
time 
Remarks: 
1.  Overview.  This keyword deﬁnes how a property (for example, th e Young’s 
modulus) of a material changes with frequency (for FREQ option) or with time 
(for TIME option).  Particularly, *MAT_ADD_PROPERTY _DEPENDENCE_-
FREQ can be used in direct SSD analysis (*FREQUENCY _DOMAIN_SSD_DI-
RECT_FREQUENCY_DEPENDENT). 
2.  Properties without Frequency/Time Dependence.   Some properties of a 
material model have no frequency or time dependence .  A warning message *MAT  *MAT_ADD_PROPERTY_DEPENDENCE  
2-118 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 will be issued if a dependence curve is deﬁned on a  property of a material, 
which has no frequency or time dependence. 
3.  Initial Property Values.   The original property value deﬁned in a material card 
will be overridden by the property values deﬁned at  frequency or time 0 in this 
keyword.  If the starting frequency or time of LCID  in this keyword is larger 
than 0, then the original property value deﬁned in the material card is used 
until the starting frequency or time of LCID is rea ched. 
4.  Supported Material Models and Properties.   So far, only the Young’s 
modulus (E) of *MAT_ELASTIC is supported by this ke yword.  More material 
models (and properties) will be supported in the fu ture. *MAT_ADD_PZELECTRIC  *MAT  
LS-DYNA R13 2-119 (MAT) *MAT_ADD_PZELECTRIC  
The ADD_PZELECTRIC option is used to occupy an arbi trary material model in LS-
DYNA with a piezoelectric property.  This option ap plies to 4-node solids, 6-node 
solids, 8-node solids, thick shells, 2D plane strai n elements and axisymmetric solids.  
Orthotropic properties are assumed.  This feature i s available in SMP since 115324/dev 
and MPP since 126577/dev.  We recommend a double pr ecision executable.

Remarks: 
When invoking the isotropic thermal expansion prope rty (no local |u1D466 and /u1D46̅ parameters) 
for a material, the stress update is based on the e lastic strain rates given by 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J2Cst= |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst − |u1D6F+(|u1D447)|u1D447̇|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
rather than on the total strain rates |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . For a material with the stress based on the 
deformation gradient, |u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , the elastic part of the deformation gradient is us ed for the 
stress computations: 
|u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J2Cst=/u1D4:D|u1D447Cst−|oneCst/|threeCst|u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   , 
where /u1D4:D|u1D447Cst is the thermal Jacobian.  The thermal Jacobian is updated using the rate given 
by  
/u1D4:Ḋ|u1D447Cst= 3|u1D6F+(|u1D447)|u1D447̇/u1D4:D|u1D447Cst  . 
For orthotropic properties, which apply only to mat erials with anisotropy, these 
equations are generalized to 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J2Cst= |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst − |u1D6F+|u1D4J8Cst(|u1D447)|u1D447̇/u1D45E|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J8Cst /u1D45E|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst

|u1D6FḊ|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D447)|u1D447̇|u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst  . 
Here /u1D45E|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  represents the matrix with material directions wit h respect to the current 
conﬁguration whereas |u1D444|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  are the corresponding directions with respect to t he initial 
conﬁguration.  For (shell) materials with multiple layers of diﬀerent anisotropy 
directions, the mid surface layer determines the or thotropy for the thermal expansion. *MAT_NONLOCAL  *MAT  
LS-DYNA R13 2-127 (MAT) *MAT_NONLOCAL  
In nonlocal failure theories, the failure criterion  depends on the state of the material 
within a radius of inﬂuence which surrounds the int egration point.  An advantage of 
nonlocal failure is that mesh size sensitivity on f ailure is greatly reduced leading to 
results which converge to a unique solution as the mesh is reﬁned. 
 
Without a nonlocal criterion, strains will tend to localize randomly with mesh 
reﬁnement leading to results which can change signi ﬁcantly from mesh to mesh.  The 
nonlocal failure treatment can be a great help in p redicting the onset and the evolution 
of material failure.  This option can be used with two and three-dimensional solid 
elements, three-dimensional shell elements, and thi ck shell elements.  This option 
applies to a subset of elastoplastic materials that  include a damage-based failure 
criterion.

Remarks: 
1.  NHV and NHVT . NHV is a count of the number of variables for which  
increments of the variable are used in the nonlocal  function.  NHVT is a count 
of the number of variables for which the whole valu e of the variable is used in 
the nonlocal function.  NHVT type variables would b e used only if the variable 
is itself an increment of some value which is rare.   Many history variables are 
calculated by a sum of increments, but since the va riable is the sum, one would 
include this variable in the NHV type variables for  nonlocal treatment so that 
only the increments are modiﬁed. 
2.  History Variables.   For elastoplastic material models in LS-DYNA whic h use 
the plastic strain as a failure criterion, setting the variable NL1 to 1 would ﬂag 
plastic strain for nonlocal treatment.  A sampling of other history variables that 
can be ﬂagged for nonlocal treatment are listed in the table below.  The value L

3.  Integration Points and Nonlocal Equations.   When applying the nonlocal 
equations to shell and thick shell elements, integr ation points lying in the same 
plane within the radius determined by the character istic length are considered.  
Therefore, it is important to deﬁne the connectivit y of the shell elements con- 
sistently within the part ID, so that, for example,  the outer integration points lie 
on the same surface. 
4.  Nonlocal Equations.   The equations and our implementation are based on  the 
implementation by Worswick and Lalbin [1999] of the  nonlocal theory to Pi- 
jaudier-Cabot and Bazant [1987].  Let  Ω|u1D4JFCst be the neighborhood of radius, L, of

Remarks: 
1.  Finite Strains.   This hypoelastic material model may not be stable  for ﬁnite 
(large) strains.   If large strains are expected, a  hyperelastic material model, 
such as *MAT_002, would be more appropriate. 
2.  Damping Factors.  The axial and bending damping factors are used to d amp 
down numerical noise.  The update of the force resu ltants, |u1D439|u1D4J6Cst, and moment 
resultants, |u1D44≠|u1D4J6Cst, includes the damping factors:

stress given by 
|u1D7≠∆ = 0.05|u1D7≠+ /u1D450/u1D4:F //u1D6E5 |u1D461 
where |u1D7≠+ is the mass density, /u1D450 is the material wave speed, /u1D4:F is the element 
length, and /u1D6E5 |u1D461  is the computation time step.  *MAT_ELASTIC  *MAT_001  
LS-DYNA R13 2-133 (MAT) 5.  FLUID Keyword Option.   For the FLUID keyword option, the bulk modulus 
ﬁeld, |u1D43∆, must be deﬁned, and both the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio 
ﬁelds are ignored.  Fluid-like behavior is obtained  where the bulk modulus, |u1D43∆, 
and pressure rate, |u1D4JD, are given by: 
|u1D43∆ =|u1D438
3(1 − 2/u1D̅08)
|u1D4JḊ= − |u1D43∆|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J6Cst  
and the shear modulus is set to zero.  A tensor vis cosity is used which acts only 
the deviatoric stresses, |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst, given in terms of the damping coeﬃcient as: 
|u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst=V C × ∆/u1D4:F× |u1D44∆ × |u1D7≠+|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst 
where ∆/u1D4:F is a characteristic element length, |u1D44∆ is the ﬂuid bulk sound speed, |u1D7≠+ is 
the ﬂuid density, and |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst is the deviatoric strain rate. *MAT_002  *MAT_ OPTION TROPIC_ELASTIC  
2-134 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 *MAT _OPTION TROPIC_ELASTIC 
This is  Material Type 2.  This material is valid for modeli ng the elastic-orthotropic 
behavior of solids, shells, and thick shells.  An a nisotropic option is available for solid 
elements.  For orthotropic solids an isotropic fric tional damping is available. 
 
Depending on the element type and solver, the imple mentation of this material model 
changes.  See the theory manual for more details th an the overview provided here.  In 
the case of solids with an explicit solver or nonli near implicit solver (meaning 
NSOLVR ≠ 1 on *CONTROL_IMPLICIT_SOLUTION), the mode l is the (hyperelastic) 
St.  Venant-Kirchhoﬀ model.  The stress update is p erformed using the second Piola-
Kirchhoﬀ tensor.  It is then transformed into the C auchy stress for output.  For shells 
(and this includes the 2D continuum elements, that is, shell types 13, 14, and 15), the 
model is implemented in the local coordinates of th e shell as linear elasticity for explicit 
and nonlinear implicit.  While the material respons e is linear, the shells themselves can 
undergo ﬁnite rotations consistent with applied for ces.  For the linear implicit solver, 
this material model is a linear elasticity model.  
NOTE:  This material does not support speciﬁcation of a m a- 
terial angle, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst, for each through-thickness integra- 
tion point of a shell.

direction is from node 1 to node 2 of the element.  The 
/u1D41B-direction is orthogonal to the /u1D41A-dir ection and is in the 
plane formed by nodes 1, 2, and 4. When this option  is 
used in two- dimensional planar and axisymmetric 
analysis, it is critical that the nodes in the elem ent deﬁ- 
nition be numbered counterclockwise for this option  to

ment (see Figure M2-1 ). The plane of a solid element is 
the midsurface between the inner su rface and outer 
surface deﬁned by the ﬁrst four nodes and the last four 
nodes of the connectivity of the element, respectiv ely.  
Thus, for solid elements, AOPT = 3 is only available for 
hexahedrons. /u1D41A is determined by taking the cross 
product of /u1D42F with the normal vector, /u1D41B is determined 
by taking the cross product of the normal vector wi th /u1D41A, 
and /u1D41C is the normal vector.  Then /u1D41A and /u1D41B are rotated 
about /u1D41C by an angle BETA. BE TA may be set in the 
keyword input for the element or in the input for t h is 
keyword.  Note that for solids, the material axes m ay 
be switched depending on the choice of MACF. The 
switch may occur before or after applying BETA de- 
pending on the value of MACF.  
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotropic in a cylindrical coordinate sys tem 
with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D443, which deﬁne the centerline ax- 
is.  This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: |AOPT|  is a coordinate system ID (see *DEFINE_CO-

G Shear modulus for frequency independent damping.  F requency 
independent damping is based on a spring and slider  in series.  
The critical stress for the slider mechanism is SIG F.  For the best 
results, the value of G should be 250- 1000 times greater than 
SIGF.  This option applies only to solid elements.

minor Poisson’s ratio if EA > EC or EB > EC, and th e major Poisson’s ratio if 
the EC > EA or EC > EB.

Material Directions: 
We will give an overview of how LS-DYNA ﬁnds the pr incipal material directions for 
solid and shell elements for this material and othe r anisotropic materials based on the 
input.  We will call the material coordinate system  the {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} coordinate system.  The 
AOPT options illustrated in Figure M2-1  deﬁne the preliminary {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} system for all 
elements of the parts that use the material, but th is is not the ﬁnal material direction.  
The {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} system deﬁned by the AOPT options may be oﬀset by a ﬁnal rotation about 
the /u1D41C-axis.  The oﬀset angle we call BETA. Note that *EL EMENT_SOLID_ORTHO and 
*ELEMENT_SHELL_MCID allow you to set the preliminar y {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} coordinate system 
for individual solid and shell elements, instead of  using the preliminary system created 
with AOPT. Figures M2-2  and M2-3  give the ﬂow chart for ﬁnding the ﬁnal material 
direction based on the input to the *MAT keyword an d the *ELEMENT keyword.  As 
indicated in the ﬁgures, the orientation of the ﬁna l material axes is updated 
continuously through the simulation as the element moves and deforms, in accordance 
with the invariant numbering scheme (INN in *CONTRO L_ACCURACY). 
 
For solid elements, the BETA angle is speciﬁed in o ne of two ways.  When using 
AOPT = 3, the BETA parameter deﬁnes the oﬀset angle  for all elements that use the 
material.  The BETA parameter on *MAT has no meanin g for the other AOPT options.  
Alternatively, a BETA angle can be deﬁned for indiv idual solid elements as described in 
Remark 5 for *ELEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO.  The BETA angle set using the ORTHO 
option is available for all values of AOPT, and it overrides the BETA angle on the *MAT 
card for AOPT = 3 (see Figure M2-2 ). Note that when the BETA angle is applied in 
either case depends on the value of MACF (if availa ble) of the *MAT keyword.  With 
MACF two of the material directions may be switched .  
 
There are two fundamental diﬀerences between shell and solid element orthotropic 
materials.  (In the following discussion, tshell el ements fall into the “shell” category.)  
First, the /u1D41C-direction is always normal to a shell element such  that the /u1D41A and /u1D41B-directions 
are within the plane of the element.  Second, for s ome anisotropic materials, shell 
elements may have unique ﬁber directions within eac h layer through the thickness of 
the element so that a layered composite can be mode led with a single element.   
 *MAT_002  *MAT_ OPTION TROPIC_ELASTIC  
2-144 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 As a result of the /u1D41C-direction being deﬁned by the element normal, MACF  does not 
apply to shells.  Similarly, AOPT = 1 and AOPT = 4 are not available for shells.  Also, 
AOPT = 2 requires only the vector /u1D41A be speciﬁed since /u1D41D is not used.  The shell 
procedure projects the inputted /u1D41A-direction onto each element surface. 
 
Note that when AOPT = 0 is used in two-dimensional planar and axisymmetric 
analysis, it is critical that the nodes in the elem ent deﬁnition be numbered counter- 
clockwise for this option to work correctly.  
 
Similar to solid elements, the {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} coordinate system determined by AOPT is then 
modiﬁed by a rotation about the /u1D41C-axis which we will call /u1D̅1∫.  For those materials that 
allow a unique rotation angle for each integration point through the element thickness, 
the rotation angle is calculated by 
/u1D̅1∫|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D6FD + |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst  , 
where |u1D6FD is a rotation for the element, and |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst is the rotation for the ith  layer of the 
element.  The |u1D6FD angle can be input using the BETA parameter on the  *MAT data but 
will be overridden for individual elements if *ELEM ENT_SHELL_BETA (*ELEMENT_-
TSHELL_BETA) is used.  The |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst angles are input using the ICOMP = 1 option of *SE C-
TION_SHELL (*SECTION_TSHELL) or with *PART_COMPOSIT E (*PART_COMPOS-
ITE_TSHELL).  If |u1D6FD or |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst is omitted, they are assumed to be zero. 
 
All anisotropic shell materials have the BETA param eter on the *MAT card available for 
both AOPT = 0 and AOPT = 3, except for materials 91  and 92 which have it available 
(but called FANG instead of BETA) for AOPT = 0, 2, and 3. 
 
All anisotropic shell materials allow an angle for each integration point through the 
thickness, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst, except for  materials 2, 86, 91, 92, 117, 130, 170, 172, and 1 94.   *MAT_ OPTION TROPIC_ELASTIC  *MAT_002

approach for hypo-elastoplasticity, using the Jauma nn rate for objectivity.  The 
rate of Cauchy stress /u1D6D4 can be expressed as 
/u1D6D4̇=/u1D402|parenleftCv2/u1D6C6̇−/u1D6C6̇|u1D447Cst−/u1D6C6̇|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 +/u1D402̇/u1D402−|oneCst/u1D6D4  , 
where /u1D402 is the temperature dependent isotropic elasticity tensor, /u1D6C6̇ is the rate-
of-deformation, /u1D6C6̇|u1D447Cst is the thermal strain rate, and /u1D6C6̇|u1D4JDCst is the plastic strain rate.  
The coeﬃcient of thermal expansion is deﬁned as the  instantaneous value.  
Thus, the thermal strain rate becomes 
/u1D6C6̇|u1D447Cst= |u1D6F+|u1D447̇/u1D408 
where |u1D6F+ is the temperature dependent thermal expansion coe ﬃcient, |u1D447̇ is the 
rate of temperature and /u1D408 is the identity tensor.  Associated von Mises plas ticity 
is adopted, resulting in  
/u1D6C6̇|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst3/u1D42C
2|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt 
where |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain rate, /u1D42C is the deviatoric stress tensor, and 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt is the von Mises eﬀective stress.  The last term a ccounts for stress changes 
due to change in stiﬀness with respect to temperatu re, using the total elastic 
strain deﬁned as /u1D6C6|u1D4J2Cst=/u1D402−|oneCst/u1D6D4.  As a way to intuitively understand this contribu - 
tion, the special case of small displacement elasti city neglecting everything but 
the temperature dependent elasticity parameters giv es 
/u1D6D4̇=|u1D4J1
|u1D4J1|u1D461 (/u1D402/u1D6C6)  , 
showing that the stress may change without any chan ge in strain. 
2.  Model Requirements and Restrictions.   At least two temperatures and their 
corresponding material properties must be deﬁned.  The analysis will be ter- 
minated if a material temperature falls outside the  range deﬁned in the input.  
If a thermo-elastic material is considered, do not deﬁne SIGY and ETAN.

Relative volume is a ratio of the current volume to  the initial volume at the 
start of the calculation.  The tabulated data shoul d be given in order of increas- 
ing compression.  If the pressure drops below the c utoﬀ value speciﬁed, it is 
reset to that value.  For a detailed description we  refer to Kreig [1972]. The bulk unloading modulus is used
if the volumetric crushing option is on

There is no strain hardening on this surface.   
To eliminate the pressure dependence of the yield s trength, set: 
|u1D44∆|oneCst= |u1D44∆|twoCst= 0   and   |u1D44∆|zeroCst=1

This approach is useful when a von Mises type elast ic-plastic model is desired 
for use with the tabulated volumetric data. 
3.  Equivalent Plastic Strain.   The history variable labeled as “plastic strain” by 
LS-PrePost is actually plastic volumetric strain.  Note that when VCR = 1.0, 
plastic volumetric strain is zero. *MAT_VISCOELASTIC  *MAT_006

Burn fractions, |u1D439, which multiply the equations of states for high e xplosives, control the 
release of chemical energy for simulating detonatio ns.  At any time, the pressure in a 
high explosive element is given by: 
|u1D4JD = |u1D439|u1D4JDeos (|u1D449, |u1D438) , 
where |u1D4JDeos  is the pressure from the equation of state (either  types 2, 3, or 14), |u1D449 is the

2-164 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 In the initialization phase, a lighting time, |u1D461|u1D4J9Cst, is computed for each element by dividing 
the distance from the detonation point to the cente r of the element by the detonation 
velocity, |u1D437.  If multiple detonation points are deﬁned, the cl osest detonation point 
determines t l.  The burn fraction |u1D439 is taken as the maximum,

where |u1D449/u1D4:6.st/u1D4:D.st is the Chapman-Jouguet relative volume and |u1D461 is current time.  If |u1D439 exceeds 1, 
it is reset to 1.  This calculation of the burn fra ction usually requires several time steps 
for |u1D439 to reach unity, thereby spreading the burn front o ver several elements.  After 
reaching unity, |u1D439 is held constant.  This burn fraction calculation is based on work by 
Wilkins [1964] and is also discussed by Giroux [197 3]. 
 
If the beta burn option is used, BETA = 1.0, any vo lumetric compression will cause 
detonation and  
|u1D439 = |u1D439|twoCst  . 
|u1D439|oneCst is not computed. BETA  =  1 does not allow for the  initialization of the lighting time. 
 
If the programmed burn is used, BETA = 2.0, the und etonated high explosive material 
will behave as an elastic perfectly plastic materia l if the bulk modulus, shear modulus, 
and yield stress are deﬁned.  Therefore, with this option the explosive material can 
compress without causing detonation.  The location and time of detonation is controlled 
by *INITIAL_DETONATION. 
 
As an option, the high explosive material can behav e as an elastic perfectly-plastic solid 
prior to detonation.  In this case we update the st ress tensor, to an elastic trial stress, ∗

This is  Material Type 9.  
In the case of solids and thick shells, this materi al allows equations of state to be 
considered without computing deviatoric stresses.  Optionally, a viscosity can be 
deﬁned.  Also, erosion in tension and compression i s possible. 
Beams and shells that use this material type are co mpletely bypassed in the element 
processing; however, the mass of the null beam or s hell elements is computed and 
added to the nodal points which deﬁne the connectiv ity.  The mass of null beams is 
ignored if the value of the density is less than 10-11 .  The Young’s modulus and Poisson’s 
ratio are used only for setting the contact stiﬀnes s, and it is recommended that 
reasonable values be input.  The variables PC, MU, TEROD, and CEROD do not apply 
to beams and shells.  Historically, null beams and/ or null shells have been used as an 
aid in modeling of contact, but this practice is no w seldom needed.

Remarks: 
These remarks apply to solids and thick shells only . 
1.  Material Model.   When used with solids or thick shells, this mater ial must be 
used with an equation-of-state.  Pressure cutoﬀ is negative in tension.  A (devi- 
atoric) viscous stress of the form,  
|u1D7≠∆|minuteCst
|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = 2|u1D7≠7|u1D7≠≠|minuteCsṫ|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   ,  
is computed for nonzero |u1D7≠7, where |u1D7≠≠′̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  is the deviatoric strain rate and |u1D7≠7 is the 
dynamic viscosity.  Analyzing the dimensions of the  above equation gives 
units of the components in SI of 
|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|<racketriµhtCvJ~|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ |<racketleftCvJ1
|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ  . 
Therefore, |u1D7≠7 may have units of [Pa × s]. 
2.  Hourglass Control.   Null materials have no shear stiﬀness (except fro m 
viscosity) and hourglass control must be used with great care.  In some appli- 
cations, the default hourglass coeﬃcient may lead t o signiﬁcant energy losses.  
In general, for ﬂuids the hourglass coeﬃcient QM sh ould be small (in the range 
10 -6 to 10 -4), and the hourglass type IHQ should be set to 1 (d efault). 
3.  Yield Strength.   The Null material has no yield strength and behav es in a 
ﬂuid-like manner. 
4.  Cut-off Pressure.   The cut-oﬀ pressure, PC, must be deﬁned to allow for a 
material to “numerically” cavitate.  In other words , when a material undergoes 
dilatation above certain magnitude, it should no lo nger be able to resist this 
dilatation.  Since dilatation stress or pressure is  negative, setting the PC limit to 
a very small negative number would allow for the ma terial to cavitate once the 
pressure in the material goes below this negative v alue. *MAT_010  *MAT_ELASTIC_PLASTIC_HYDRO

Remarks: 
1.  Model Overview.   This model is applicable to a wide range of mater ials, 
including those with pressure-dependent yield behav ior.  The use of 16 points 
in the yield stress as a function of eﬀective plast ic strain curve allows complex 
post-yield hardening behavior to be accurately repr esented.  In addition, the 
incorporation of an equation of state permits accur ate modeling of a variety of 0Piecewise linear curve defining
the yield stress versus effective
plastic strain.  As illustrated, the
yield stress at zero plastic strain
should be nonzero.σy

failure, fracture, and disintegration eﬀects under tensile loads. 
The STOCHASTIC option allows spatially varying yiel d and failure behavior.  
See *DEFINE_STOCHASTIC_VARIATION for additional inf ormation. 
2.  Yield Stress and Plastic Hardening Modulus.   If ES and EPS values are 
undeﬁned, the yield stress and plastic hardening mo dulus are taken from SIG0 
and EH.  In this case, the bilinear stress-strain c urve shown in M10-1  is ob- 
tained with hardening parameter, |u1D6FD = 1 .  The yield strength is calculated as 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D438/uni210E.st|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst+ |parenleftCv1|u1D44∆|oneCst+ |u1D4JD|u1D44∆|twoCst|parenriµhtCv1max|<racketleftCv1|u1D4JD, 0|<racketriµhtCv1  . 
The quantity |u1D438/uni210E.st is the plastic hardening modulus deﬁned in terms o f Young’s 
modulus, |u1D438, and the tangent modulus, |u1D438|u1D461Cst, as follows 
|u1D438/uni210E.st=|u1D438|u1D461Cst|u1D438
|u1D438 − |u1D438|u1D461Cst. 
The pressure, |u1D4JD, is taken as positive in compression. 
If ES and EPS are speciﬁed, a curve like that shown  in Figure M10-1  may be 
deﬁned.  Eﬀective stress is deﬁned in terms of the deviatoric stress tensor, |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , 
as: 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt= |parenleftCvJ3
2|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2
 
and eﬀective plastic strain by: 
|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst=/integral.v:|parenleftCvJ2
3|u1D437|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JDCst|u1D437|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2
|u1D4J1|u1D461 |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst  , 
where |u1D461 denotes time and |u1D437|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JDCst is the plastic component of the rate of defor- 
mation tensor.  In this case the plastic hardening modulus on Card 1 is ignored 
and the yield stress is given as 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1  , 
where the value for |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1 is found by interpolating the data curve. 
3.  Spall Models.  A choice of three spall models is oﬀered to represe nt material 
splitting, cracking, and failure under tensile load s.   
a)  The pressure limit model, SPALL = 1, limits the hy drostatic tension to the 
speciﬁed value, |u1D4JDcut .  If pressures more tensile than this limit are ca lculat- 
ed, the pressure is reset to |u1D4JDcut .  This option is not strictly a spall model, 
since the deviatoric stresses are unaﬀected by the pressure reaching the 
tensile cutoﬀ, and the pressure cutoﬀ value, |u1D4JDcut , remains unchanged 
throughout the analysis. *MAT_ELASTIC_PLASTIC_HYDRO  *MAT_010  
LS-DYNA R13 2-173 (MAT) b)  The maximum principal stress spall model, SPALL = 2, detects spall if the 
maximum principal stress, |u1D7≠∆max , exceeds the limiting value - |u1D4JDcut .  Note 
that the negative sign is required because |u1D4JDcut  is measured positive in 
compression, while |u1D7≠∆max  is positive in tension.  Once spall is detected wi th 
this model, the deviatoric stresses are reset to ze ro, and no hydrostatic 
tension ( |u1D4JD < 0 ) is permitted.  If tensile pressures are calculate d, they are 
reset to 0 in the spalled material.  Thus, the spal led material behaves as a 
rubble or incohesive material. 
c)  The hydrostatic tension spall model, SPALL = 3, de tects spall if the pres- 
sure becomes more tensile than the speciﬁed limit, |u1D4JDcut .  Once spall is de- 
tected the deviatoric stresses are reset to zero, a nd nonzero values of 
pressure are required to be compressive (positive).   If hydrostatic tension 
(|u1D4JD < 0 ) is subsequently calculated, the pressure is reset  to 0 for that ele- 
ment. *MAT_011  *MAT_STEINBERG

This is  Material Type 11.  This material is available for m odeling materials deforming at 
very high strain rates (> 10 5 per second) and can be used with solid elements.  The yield 
strength is a function of temperature and pressure.   An equation of state determines the 
pressure. 
This model is applicable to a wide range of materia ls, including those with pressure-
dependent yield behavior.  In addition, the incorpo ration of an equation of state permits 
accurate modeling of a variety of diﬀerent material s.  The spall model options permit 
incorporation of material failure, fracture, and di sintegration eﬀects under tensile loads.

|u1D43A = |u1D43A|zeroCst|<racketleftCvJ1 + |u1D44F|u1D4JD|u1D449|oneCst|threeCst/fraction.v2−ℎ|parenleftCvJ|u1D438|u1D4J6Cst− |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst

|u1D438Cst/u1D45A.sts−|u1D438Cst |u1D4J6Csts  , 
where |u1D4JD is the pressure, |u1D449 is the relative volume, |u1D438/u1D450 (see Remark 4 ) is the cold 
compression energy, and |u1D438|u1D4JACst is the melting energy.  |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst is given by: 
|u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst(|u1D46J) =/integral.v:|u1D4JD(/u1D44B)|u1D4J1 /u1D44B |u1D46JCst

(1 − |u1D46J)(/u1D6FE.st/o.sts−|u1D44∆Cst)   
with 
|u1D46J = 1 − |u1D449  . 
|u1D438|u1D4JA is deﬁned as: 
|u1D438|u1D4JACst(|u1D46J) = |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst(|u1D46J) + 3|u1D44J|minuteCst|u1D447Cst/u1D45A.sts(|u1D46JCst) . 
|u1D438|u1D4JACst is in terms of the melting temperature |u1D447|u1D4JACst(|u1D46J): 
|u1D447|u1D4JACst(|u1D46J) =|u1D447mo exp(2|u1D44∆|u1D46J)

and the melting temperature at |u1D7≠+ = |u1D7≠+/u1D45C.st, |u1D447mo . 
In the above equations |u1D44J′ is deﬁned by  *MAT_STEINBERG  *MAT_011  
LS-DYNA R13 2-177 (MAT) |u1D44J|minuteCst=|u1D44J|u1D7≠+ 
|u1D434 , 
where |u1D44J is the gas constant and |u1D434 is the atomic weight.  If |u1D44J|minuteCst is not deﬁned, LS-
DYNA computes it with |u1D44J in the cm-gram-microsecond system of units. 
3.  Yield Strength.   The yield strength, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst, is given by: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆/u1D45C.st|minuteCst|<racketleftCvJ1 + |u1D44F′|u1D4JD|u1D449|oneCst|threeCst/fraction.v2−ℎ|parenleftCvJ|u1D438|u1D4J6Cst− |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst

|u1D438Cst/u1D45A.sts−|u1D438Cst |u1D4J6Csts 
if |u1D438|u1D4JA exceeds |u1D438|u1D4J6 (see Remark 2).  Here, |u1D7≠∆/u1D45C.st|minuteCst is: 
|u1D7≠∆/u1D45C.st|minuteCst= |u1D7≠∆/u1D45C.st|<racketleftCv11 + |u1D6FD|parenleftCv1|u1D6F∆|u1D4J6Cst+ |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1|<racketriµhtCv1|u1D4JBCst 
where |u1D7≠∆/u1D45C.st is the initial yield stress and  |u1D6F∆|u1D4J6Cst is the initial plastic strain.  If the work-
hardened yield stress |u1D7≠∆/u1D45C.st|minuteCst exceeds |u1D4JA, |u1D7≠∆/u1D45C.st|minuteCst
 is set equal to |u1D4JA.  After the materials 
melt, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466 and |u1D43A are set to one half their initial value. 
4.  Cold Compression Energy.   If the coeﬃcients EC0, …, EC9 are not deﬁned 
above, LS-DYNA will ﬁt the cold compression energy to a ten term polynomial 
expansion either as a function of |u1D7≠7 or |u1D7≠2 depending on ﬁeld FLAG as: 
|u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠2|u1D4J6Cst|parenriµhtCv2 = |summationCv1 EC |u1D4J6Cst|u1D7≠2|u1D4J6Cst/nine.st

|u1D4J6Cst=|zeroCst 
where EC |u1D4J6Cst is the ith  coeﬃcient and: 
|u1D7≠2 =|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+/u1D45C.st
|u1D7≠7 =|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+/u1D45C.st− 1 
A linear least squares method is used to perform th e ﬁt. 
5.  Spall Models.   A choice of three spall models is oﬀered to repre sent material 
splitting, cracking, and failure under tensile load s.   
a)  Pressure Limit Model.   The pressure limit model, SPALL = 1, limits the h y- 
drostatic tension to the speciﬁed value, |u1D4JDcut .  If a pressure more tensile 
than this limit is calculated, the pressure is rese t to |u1D4JDcut .  This option is not 
strictly a spall model, since the deviatoric stress es are unaﬀected by the 
pressure reaching the tensile cutoﬀ, and the pressu re cutoﬀ value, |u1D4JDcut , 
remains unchanged throughout the analysis.   
b)  Maximum Principal Stress Spall Model.   The maximum principal stress spall 
model, SPALL = 2, detects spall if the maximum prin cipal stress, |u1D7≠∆max , ex- 
ceeds the limiting value - |u1D4JDcut .  Note that the negative sign is required be- *MAT_011  *MAT_STEINBERG  
2-178 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 cause |u1D4JDcut  is measured positive in compression, while |u1D7≠∆max  is positive in 
tension.  Once spall is detected with this model, t he deviatoric stresses are 
reset to zero, and no hydrostatic tension ( |u1D4JD < 0 ) is permitted.  If tensile 
pressures are calculated, they are reset to 0 in th e spalled material.  Thus, 
the spalled material behaves as a rubble or incohes ive material. 
c)  Hydrostatic Tension Spall Model.   The hydrostatic tension spall model, 
SPALL = 3, detects spall if the pressure becomes mo re tensile than the 
speciﬁed limit, |u1D4JDcut .  Once spall is detected the deviatoric stresses a re reset 
to zero, and nonzero values of pressure are require d to be compressive 
(positive).  If hydrostatic tension ( |u1D4JD < 0 ) is subsequently calculated, the 
pressure is reset to 0 for that element. *MAT_STEINBERG_LUND  *MAT_011_LUND

C2 Coeﬃcient of drag term in rate dependent model 
YP Peierls stress for rate dependent model 
YA A thermal yield stress for rate dependent model 
YMAX Work hardening maximum for rate model 
Remarks: 
This model is similar in theory to the *MAT_STEINBE RG above but with the addition 
of rate eﬀects.  When rate eﬀects are included, the  yield stress is given by: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst=/˙raceleft.v2/u1D44C|u1D447Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, |u1D447|parenriµhtCv2 +/u1D44C|u1D434Cst|u1D4J3 |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2/˙raceright.v2|u1D43A|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD, |u1D447|parenriµhtCv1
|u1D43A|zeroCst  . 
There are two imposed limits on the yield stress.  The ﬁrst condition is on the 
nonthermal yield stress: 
/u1D44C|u1D434Cst|u1D4J3 |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 =/u1D44C|u1D434Cst|<racketleftCv11 + |u1D6FD|parenleftCv1|u1D6F∆|u1D4J6Cst+ |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1|<racketriµhtCv1|u1D4JBCst≤/u1D44Cmax   
and comes from the limit of the ﬁrst term in |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst being small.  In this case /u1D44C|u1D434Cst|u1D4J3 |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 
reduces to |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst|minuteCst from the *MAT_011 material model (see Remark 3  of *MAT_011).  The 
second limit is on the thermal part: 
/u1D44C|u1D447Cst≤/u1D44C|u1D443Cst  .*MAT_ISOTROPIC_ELASTIC_PLASTIC  *MAT_012  
LS-DYNA R13 2-183 (MAT) *MAT_ISOTROPIC_ELASTIC_PLASTIC  
This is  Material Type 12.  This is a very low cost isotropi c plasticity model for three-
dimensional solids.  In the plane stress implementa tion for shell elements, a one-step 
radial return approach is used to scale the Cauchy stress tensor if the state of stress 
exceeds the yield surface.  This approach to plasti city leads to inaccurate shell thickness 
updates and stresses after yielding.  This is the o nly model in LS-DYNA for plane stress 
that does not default to an iterative approach.

REM Element erosion option: 
EQ.0.0: failed element eroded after failure. 
NE.0.0: element is kept, no removal except by ∆|u1D461 below. 
TREM ∆|u1D461 for element removal: 
EQ.0.0: ∆|u1D461 is not considered (default). 
GT.0.0: element eroded if element time step size falls belo w ∆|u1D461. 
Remarks: 
When the eﬀective plastic strain reaches the failur e strain or when the pressure reaches 
the failure pressure, the element loses its ability  to carry tension and the deviatoric 
stresses are set to zero, causing the material to b ehave like a ﬂuid.  If ∆|u1D461 for element 
removal is deﬁned, the element removal option is ig nored. 
 
The element erosion option based on ∆|u1D461 must be used cautiously with the contact 
options.  Nodes to surface contact is recommended w ith all nodes of the eroded brick 
elements included in the node list.  As the element s are eroded the mass remains and 
continues to interact with the master surface. *MAT_014  *MAT_SOIL_AND_FOAM_FAILURE

This is  Material Type 14.  The input for this model is the same as for *MATERIAL_-
SOIL_AND_FOAM (Type 5); however, when the pressure reaches the tensile failure 
pressure, the element loses its ability to carry te nsion.  It should be used only in 
situations when soils and foams are conﬁned within a structure or are otherwise 
conﬁned by nodal boundary conditions. *MAT_JOHNSON_COOK  *MAT_015  
LS-DYNA R13 2-187 (MAT) *MAT_JOHNSON_COOK _{OPTION}  
This is  Material Type 15.  The Johnson/Cook strain and temp erature sensitive plasticity 
is sometimes used for problems where the strain rat es vary over a large range and 
adiabatic temperature increases due to plastic heat ing cause material softening.  When 
used with solid elements, this model requires an eq uation-of-state.  If thermal eﬀects 
and damage are unimportant, we recommend the much l ess expensive *MAT_SIMPLI-
FIED_JOHNSON_COOK model.  The simpliﬁed model can b e used with beam 
elements. 
Material type 15 is applicable to the high rate def ormation of many materials including 
most metals.  Unlike the Steinberg-Guinan model, th e Johnson-Cook model remains 
valid down to lower strain rates and even into the quasistatic regime.  Typical 
applications include explosive metal forming, balli stic penetration, and impact.

The quantity |u1D447 − |u1D447room  is stored as extra history variable 5.  In the cas e of a

In a coupled thermal/mechanical analysis, |u1D447 − |u1D447room  includes heat- 
ing/cooling from all sources, not just adiabatic he ating from the internal ener- 
gy. 
Constants for a variety of materials are provided i n Johnson and Cook [1983].  
A fully viscoplastic formulation is optional (VP) w hich incorporates the rate 
equations within the yield surface.  An additional cost is incurred, but the im- 
provement in the results can be dramatic. 
Due to nonlinearity in the dependence of ﬂow stress  on plastic strain, an accu- 
rate value of the ﬂow stress requires iteration for  the increment in plastic 
strain.  However, by using a Taylor series expansio n with linearization about 
the current time, we can solve for |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst with suﬃcient accuracy to avoid iteration. 
2.  Strain at Fracture.  The strain at fracture is given by 
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st= max|parenleftCv1|<racketleftCv1|u1D437|oneCst+ |u1D437|twoCstexp|u1D437|threeCst|u1D7≠∆∗|<racketriµhtCv1[1 + |u1D437|fourCstln|u1D7≠≠̇∗][1 + |u1D437|fiveCst|u1D447∗], EFMIN|parenriµhtCv1  , 
where |u1D7≠∆∗ is the ratio of pressure divided by eﬀective stres s 
|u1D7≠∆∗=|u1D4JD
|u1D7≠∆eff    . 
Fracture occurs when the damage parameter, 
|u1D437 =∑∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st  , 
reaches the value of 1.  |u1D437 is stored as extra history variable 4 in shell ele ments 
and extra history variable 6 in solid elements. 
3.  Spall Models.   A choice of three spall models is oﬀered to repre sent material 
splitting, cracking, and failure under tensile load s:  
a)  Pressure Limit Model.   The pressure limit model limits the minimum hy- 
drostatic pressure to the speciﬁed value, |u1D4JD ≥ |u1D4JDmin .  If the calculated pres- 
sure is more tensile than this limit, the pressure is reset to |u1D4JDmin .  This *MAT_JOHNSON_COOK  *MAT_015  
LS-DYNA R13 2-195 (MAT) option is not strictly a spall model since the devi atoric stresses are un- 
aﬀected by the pressure reaching the tensile cutoﬀ and the pressure cutoﬀ 
value |u1D4JDmin  remains unchanged throughout the analysis.   
b)  Maximum Principal Stress Model.  The maximum principal stress spall 
model detects spall if the maximum principal stress , |u1D7≠∆max , exceeds the lim- 
iting value |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst.  Once spall in solids is detected with this model , the devia- 
toric stresses are reset to zero, and no hydrostati c tension is permitted.  If 
tensile pressures are calculated, they are reset to  0 in the spalled material.  
Thus, the spalled material behaves as rubble.  
c)  Hydrostatic Tension Model.  The hydrostatic tension spall model detects 
spall if the pressure becomes more tensile than the  speciﬁed limit, |u1D4JDmin .  
Once spall in solids is detected with this model, t he deviatoric stresses are 
set to zero, and the pressure is required to be com pressive.  If hydrostatic 
tension is calculated, then the pressure is reset t o 0 for that element. 
4.  Shell Element Deletion Based on Time Step.  This material model also 
supports a shell element deletion criterion based o n the maximum stable time 
step size for the element, ∆|u1D461max  (see DTF on Card 1).  Generally, ∆|u1D461max  goes 
down as the element becomes more distorted.  To ass ure stability of time inte- 
gration, the global LS-DYNA time step is the minimu m of the ∆|u1D461max  values 
calculated for all elements in the model.  Using th is option allows the selective 
deletion of elements whose time step, ∆|u1D461max , has fallen below the speciﬁed min- 
imum time step, ∆|u1D461crit .  Elements which are severely distorted often indic ate 
that material has failed and supports little load, but these same elements may 
have very small time steps and, therefore, control the cost of the analysis.  This 
option allows these highly distorted elements to be  deleted from the calcula- 
tion, and, therefore, the analysis can proceed at a  larger time step, and, thus, at 
a reduced cost.  Deleted elements do not carry any load and are deleted from 
all applicable slide surface deﬁnitions.  Clearly, this option must be judiciously 
used to obtain accurate results at a minimum cost. 
5.  Optional Strain Rate Forms.   The standard Johnson-Cook strain rate term is 
linear in the logarithm of the strain rate (see Remark 1 ): 
1 + |u1D436 ln |u1D7≠≠̇∗ 
You can replace this term by setting RATEOP > 0.  T hese additional rate forms

This is  Material Type 16.  This model has been used to anal yze buried steel reinforced 
concrete structures subjected to impulsive loadings . 
This model can be used in two major modes - a simpl e tabular pressure-dependent 
yield surface and a potentially complex model featu ring two yield as a function of 
pressure functions with the means of migrating from  one curve to the other.  These 
modes are discussed in detail in the Remarks sectio n.  For both modes, load curve LCP 
is taken to be a strain rate multiplier for the yie ld strength.  Note that this model must 
be used with equation-of-state type 8, 9 or 11.

Remarks: 
1.  Response Mode I (Tabulated Yield Stress as a Functi on of Pressure).  This 
model is well suited for implementing standard geol ogic models like the 
Mohr-Coulomb yield surface with a Tresca limit, as shown in Figure M16-1 .  *MAT_PSEUDO_TENSOR  *MAT_016  
LS-DYNA R13 2-201 (MAT) Examples of converting conventional triaxial compre ssion data to this type of 
model are found in Desai and Siriwardane, 1984.  No te that under convention- 
al triaxial compression conditions, the LS-DYNA inp ut corresponds to an ordi- 
nate of |u1D7≠∆|oneCst− |u1D7≠∆|threeCst rather than the more widely used (|u1D7≠∆|oneCst− |u1D7≠∆|threeCst) 2 ⁄, where |u1D7≠∆|oneCst is the 
maximum principal stress and |u1D7≠∆|threeCstis the minimum principal stress. 
This material combined with equation-of-state type 9 (saturated) has been used 
very successfully to model ground shocks and soil-s tructure interactions at 
pressures up to 100 kbars (approximately 1.5 × 106 psi). 
To invoke Mode I of this model, set  |u1D44∆|zeroCst, |u1D44∆|oneCst, |u1D44∆|twoCst, |u1D44F|oneCst, |u1D44∆0f , and |u1D44∆1f  to zero.  The tabu- 
lated values of pressure should then be speciﬁed on  Cards 4 and 5, and the 
corresponding values of yield stress should be spec iﬁed on Cards 6 and 7.  The 
parameters relating to reinforcement properties, in itial yield stress, and tangent 
modulus are not used in this response mode and shou ld be set to zero. 
Note that |u1D44∆1f  is reset internally to 1 3 ⁄ even though it is input as zero; this de- 
ﬁnes a failed material curve of slope 3|u1D4JD, where |u1D4JD denotes pressure (positive in 
compression).  In this case the yield strength is t aken from the tabulated yield 
as a function of pressure curve until the maximum p rincipal stress ( |u1D7≠∆|oneCst) in the 
element exceeds the tensile cutoﬀ |u1D7≠∆cut  (input as variable SIGF).  When |u1D7≠∆|oneCst> |u1D7≠∆cut  
is detected, the yield strength is scaled back by a  fraction of the distance be- 
tween the two curves in each of the next 20 time st eps so that after those 20 
time steps, the yield strength is deﬁned by the fai lure curve.  The only way to 
inhibit this feature is to set |u1D7≠∆cut  (SIGF) arbitrarily large. TrescaMohr-Coulomb

2-202 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 2.  Response Mode II (Two Curve Model with Damage and F ailure).   This 
approach uses two yield versus pressure curves of t he form  
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D44∆|zeroCst+|u1D4JD
|u1D44∆|oneCst+ |u1D44∆|twoCst|u1D4JD 
The upper curve is best described as the maximum yi eld strength curve and 
the lower curve is the failed material curve.  Ther e are a variety of ways of 
moving between the two curves and each is discussed  below. 
a)  Mode II.A (Simple Tensile Failure).   To use this mode, deﬁne |u1D44∆|zeroCst, |u1D44∆|oneCst, |u1D44∆|twoCst, |u1D44∆0f , 
and |u1D44∆1f , set |u1D44F|oneCst to zero, and leave Cards 4 through 7 blank.  In th is case the 
yield strength is taken from the maximum yield curv e until the maximum 
principal stress ( |u1D7≠∆|oneCst) in the element exceeds the tensile cutoﬀ ( |u1D7≠∆cut ). When 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst> |u1D7≠∆cut  is detected, the yield strength is scaled back by a fraction of the 
distance between the two curves in each of the next  20 time steps so that 
after those 20 time steps, the yield strength is de ﬁned by the failure curve. 
b)  Mode II.B (Tensile Failure plus Plastic Strain Scal ing).   Deﬁne |u1D44∆|zeroCst, |u1D44∆|oneCst, |u1D44∆|twoCst, |u1D44∆0f , 
and |u1D44∆1f , set |u1D44F|oneCst to zero, and use Cards 4 through 7 to deﬁne a scal e factor, |u1D7≠2, 
(Cards 6 and 7) as a function of eﬀective plastic s train (Cards 4 and 5).  LS-
DYNA evaluates |u1D7≠2 at the current eﬀective plastic strain and then ca lculates 
the yield stress as 
|u1D7≠∆yield = |u1D7≠∆failed + |u1D7≠2(|u1D7≠∆max − |u1D7≠∆failed ) , 
where |u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst|xCst  and |u1D7≠∆failed  are found as shown in Figure M16-2 .  This yield 
strength is then subject to scaling for tensile fai lure as described above.  
This type of model describes a strain hardening or softening material, 
such as concrete. PressureYield

LS-DYNA R13 2-203 (MAT) c)  Model II.C (Tensile Failure plus Damage Scaling).  The change in yield stress 
as a function of plastic strain arises from the phy sical mechanisms such as 
internal cracking, and the extent of this cracking is aﬀected by the hydro- 
static pressure when the cracking occurs.  This mec hanism gives rise to the 
"conﬁnement" eﬀect on concrete behavior.  To accoun t for this phenome- 
non, a "damage" function was deﬁned and incorporate d.  This damage 
function is given the form: 
|u1D7≠6 =/integral.v:|parenleftCvJ1 +|u1D4JD
|u1D7≠∆cut |parenriµhtCvJ−|u1D44FCst|oneCsts
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠Cst|u1D4JDCsts
|zeroCst  . 
To use this model, deﬁne |u1D44∆|zeroCst, |u1D44∆|oneCst, |u1D44∆|twoCst, |u1D44∆0f , |u1D44∆1f , and |u1D44F|oneCst.  Cards 4 through 7 now 
give η as a function of λ. |u1D7≠2 scales the yield stress as 
|u1D7≠∆yield = |u1D7≠∆failed + |u1D7≠2(|u1D7≠∆max − |u1D7≠∆failed ) 
before applying any tensile failure criteria. 
3.  Mode II Concrete Model Options.  Material Type 16 Mode II provides for the 
automatic internal generation of a simple "generic"  model from concrete.  If A0 
is negative, then SIGF is assumed to be the unconﬁn ed concrete compressive 
strength, |u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst, and –A0 is assumed to be a conversion factor from  LS-DYNA pres- 
sure units to psi.  (For example, if the model stre ss units are MPa, A0  should be 
set to –145.) In this case the parameter values gen erated internally are 
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst= SIGF 
|u1D7≠∆cut = 1.7
⎝⎜⎛|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst|twoCst
−A0 ⎠⎟⎞|oneCst
|threeCst
 
|u1D44∆|zeroCst=|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst
4 |u1D44∆|oneCst=1
3 
|u1D44∆|twoCst=1
3|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst 
 |u1D44∆0f = 0 
|u1D44∆1f = 0.3 85 
Note that these |u1D44∆0f  and |u1D44∆1f  defaults will be overridden by non-zero entries on  
Card 3.  If plastic strain or damage scaling is des ired, Cards 5 through 8 as well 
as |u1D44F|oneCst should be speciﬁed in the input.  When |u1D44∆|zeroCst is input as a negative quantity, 
the equation-of-state can be given as 0 and a trili near EOS Type 8 model will be 
automatically generated from the unconﬁned compress ive strength and Pois- 
son's ratio.  The EOS 8 model is a simple pressure as a function of volumetric 
strain model with no internal energy terms, and sho uld give reasonable results 
for pressures up to 5 kbar (approximately 75,000 ps i). 
4.  Mixture Model.  A reinforcement fraction, |u1D4J3|u1D4JFCst, can be deﬁned (indirectly as 
PER 100 ⁄ ) along with properties of the reinforcement materi al.  The bulk modu- *MAT_016  *MAT_PSEUDO_TENSOR  
2-204 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 lus, shear modulus, and yield strength are then cal culated from a simple mix- 
ture rule.  For example, for the bulk modulus the r ule gives: 
|u1D43∆ = |parenleftCv11 − |u1D4J3|u1D4JFCst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D43∆|u1D4JACst+ |u1D4J3|u1D4JFCst|u1D43∆|u1D4JFCst  , 
where |u1D43∆|u1D4JACst and |u1D43∆|u1D4JFCst are the bulk moduli for the geologic material and the rein- 
forcement material, respectively.  This feature sho uld be used with caution.  It 
gives an isotropic eﬀect in the material instead of  the true anisotropic material 
behavior.  A reasonable approach would be to use th e mixture elements only 
where the reinforcing exists and plain elements els ewhere.  When the mixture 
model is being used, the strain rate multiplier for  the principal material is tak- 
en from load curve N1 and the multiplier for the re inforcement is taken from 
load curve N2. 
5.  Suggested Parameters.   The LLNL DYNA3D manual from 1991 [Whirley 
and Hallquist] suggests using the damage function ( Mode II.C) in Material 
Type 16 with the following set of parameters: 
|u1D44∆|zeroCst=|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst
4 
|u1D44∆|oneCst=1
3 |u1D44∆|twoCst=1
3|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst 
|u1D44∆|zeroCst/u1D45:.st=|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst
10  |u1D44∆|oneCst/u1D45:.st=1.5 
|u1D44F|oneCst=1.25  
and a damage table of: 
Card 4: 0.0  8.62E-06 2.15E-05 3.14E-05 3.95E-04

This set of parameters should give results consiste nt with Dilger, Koch, and 
Kowalczyk [1984] for plane concrete.  It has been s uccessfully used for rein- 
forced structures where the reinforcing bars were m odeled explicitly with em- 
bedded beam and shell elements.  The model does not  incorporate the major 
failure mechanism - separation of the concrete and reinforcement leading to 
catastrophic loss of conﬁnement pressure.  However,  experience indicates that 
this physical behavior will occur when this model s hows about 4% strain. *MAT_ORIENTED_CRACK  *MAT_017

Remarks: 
This is an isotropic elastic-plastic material which  includes a failure model with an 
oriented crack.  The von Mises yield condition is g iven by: 
/u1D̅1∫=/u1D4:D|twoCst−|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst
3  , 
where the second stress invariant, /u1D4:D|twoCst, is deﬁned in terms of the deviatoric stress 
components as 
/u1D4:D|twoCst=1
2|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   , 
and the yield stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst, is a function of the eﬀective plastic strain, |u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst, and the plastic 
hardening modulus, |u1D438|u1D4JDCst: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D438|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst  . 
The eﬀective plastic strain is deﬁned as: 
|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst=/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|u1D461Cst
|zeroCst  , 
where 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst=/radical.v52

and the plastic tangent modulus is deﬁned in terms of the input tangent modulus, |u1D438|u1D461Cst, as 
|u1D438|u1D4JDCst=|u1D438|u1D438|u1D461Cst
|u1D438 − |u1D438|u1D461Cst  . 
Pressure in this model is found from evaluating an equation of state.  A pressure cutoﬀ 
can be deﬁned such that the pressure is not allowed  to fall below the cutoﬀ value. 
 
The oriented crack fracture model is based on a max imum principal stress criterion.  
When the maximum principal stress exceeds the fract ure stress, |u1D7≠∆/u1D45:.st, the element fails on 
a plane perpendicular to the direction of the maxim um principal stress.  The normal 
stress and the two shear stresses on that plane are  then reduced to zero.  This stress 
reduction is done according to a delay function tha t reduces the stresses gradually to 
zero over a small number of time steps.  This delay  function procedure is used to reduce *MAT_ORIENTED_CRACK  *MAT_017  
LS-DYNA R13 2-207 (MAT) the ringing that may otherwise be introduced into t he system by the sudden fracture. 
The number of steps for stress reduction is 20 by d efault (CVELO = 0.0) or it is 
internally computed if CVELO > 0.0 is given, that i s: 
|u1D4JBsteps = int |<racketleftCvJ/u1D4:F|u1D4J2Cst
C V ELO × ∆|u1D461|<racketriµhtCvJ  , 
where /u1D4:F|u1D4J2Cst is the characteristic element length and ∆|u1D461 is the time step size. 
 
After a tensile fracture, the element will not supp ort tensile stress on the fracture plane, 
but in compression will support both normal and she ar stresses.  The orientation of this 
fracture surface is tracked throughout the deformat ion and is updated to properly 
model ﬁnite deformation eﬀects.  If the maximum pri ncipal stress subsequently exceeds 
the fracture stress in another direction, the eleme nt fails isotropically.  In this case the 
element completely loses its ability to support any  shear stress or hydrostatic tension, 
and only compressive hydrostatic stress states are possible.  Thus, once isotropic failure 
has occurred, the material behaves like a ﬂuid. 
 
This model is applicable to elastic or elastoplasti c materials under signiﬁcant tensile or 
shear loading when fracture is expected.  Potential  applications include brittle materials 
such as ceramics as well as porous materials such a s concrete in cases where pressure 
hardening eﬀects are not signiﬁcant. 
 
Crack propagation behavior to adjacent elements can  be controlled using parameter 
SOFT for thin, shell-like structures (for example, only 2 or 3 solids over thickness).  
Additionally, LS-DYNA must know where the plane or solid element midplane is at 
each integration point for projection of crack plan e on this element midplane.  
Therefore, element numbering must be as shown in Figure M17-1 . Currently, only solid 
element type 1 is supported with that option. 8

VP Formulation for rate eﬀects: 
EQ.0.0: scale yield stress (default) 
EQ.1.0: viscoplastic formulation 
Remarks: 
Elastoplastic behavior with isotropic hardening is provided by this model.  The yield 
stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst, is a function of plastic strain and obeys the equ ation: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst=/u1D458|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JBCst=/u1D458|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst + |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2|u1D4JBCst  , 
where |u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst  is the elastic strain to yield and  |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCstis the eﬀective plastic strain (logarithmic).  If 
SIGY is set to zero, the strain to yield is found b y solving for the intersection of the 
linearly elastic loading equation with the strain h ardening equation: 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D438|u1D7≠≠ 
|u1D7≠∆ =/u1D458|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JBCst 
which gives the elastic strain at yield as: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst = |parenleftCvJ|u1D438
/u1D458|parenriµhtCvJ|<racketleftCv4|oneCst
|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst|<racketriµhtCv4
  . 
If SIGY is nonzero and greater than 0.02 then: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst = |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst
/u1D458|parenriµhtCvJ|<racketleftCv4|oneCst
|u1D4JBCst|<racketriµhtCv4
  . 
Strain rate is accounted for using the Cowper and S ymonds model which scales the 
yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  . 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate.  A fully viscoplastic formulat ion is optional which 
incorporates the Cowper and Symonds formulation wit hin the yield surface.  An 
additional cost is incurred but the improvement is results can be dramatic. *MAT_019  *MAT_STRAIN_RATE_DEPENDENT_PLASTICITY

This is Material Type 19.  A strain rate dependent material can be deﬁned.  For an 
alternative, see Material Type 24.  A curve for the  yield strength as a function of the 
eﬀective strain rate must be deﬁned.  Optionally, Y oung’s modulus and the tangent 
modulus can also be deﬁned as a function of the eﬀe ctive strain rate.  Also, optional 
failure of the material can be deﬁned either by deﬁ ning a von Mises stress at failure as a 
function of the eﬀective strain rate (valid for sol ids/shells/thick shells) or by deﬁning a 
minimum time step size (only for shells).

Remarks: 
1.  Yield Stress.   In this model, a load curve is used to describe t he yield strength 
|u1D7≠∆|zeroCst as a function of eﬀective strain rate |u1D7≠≠̅̇ where 
|u1D7≠≠̅̇= |parenleftCvJ2
3|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2
 
and the prime denotes the deviatoric component.  Th e strain rate is available 
for post-processing as the ﬁrst stored history vari able.  If the viscoplastic op- 
tion is active, the plastic strain rate is output; otherwise, the eﬀective strain rate 
deﬁned above is output.   
The yield stress is deﬁned as 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅̇|parenriµhtCv1 + |u1D438|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst  , 
where |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain and |u1D438|u1D4JDCst is given in terms of Young’s mod- 
ulus and the tangent modulus by *MAT_019  *MAT_STRAIN_RATE_DEPENDENT_PLASTICITY  
2-212 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 |u1D438|u1D4JDCst=|u1D438|u1D438|u1D461Cst
|u1D438 − |u1D438|u1D461Cst  . 
Both the Young's modulus and the tangent modulus ma y optionally be made 
functions of strain rate by specifying a load curve  ID giving their values as a 
function of strain rate.  If these load curve IDs a re input as 0, then the constant 
values speciﬁed in the input are used. 
2.  Load Curves.   Note that all load curves used to deﬁne quantitie s as a function 
of strain rate must have the same number of points at the same strain rate val- 
ues.  This requirement is used to allow vectorized interpolation to enhance the 
execution speed of this constitutive model. 
3.  Material Failure.   This model also contains a simple mechanism for m odeling 
material failure.  This option is activated by spec ifying a load curve ID deﬁning 
the eﬀective stress at failure as a function of str ain rate.  For solid elements, 
once the eﬀective stress exceeds the failure stress  the element is deemed to 
have failed and is removed from the solution.  For shell elements the entire 
shell element is deemed to have failed if all integ ration points through the 
thickness have an eﬀective stress that exceeds the failure stress.  After failure 
the shell element is removed from the solution. 
In addition to the above failure criterion, this ma terial model also supports a 
shell element deletion criterion based on the maxim um stable time step size for 
the element, ∆|u1D461|mCst|aCst|xCst .  Generally, ∆|u1D461|mCst|aCst|xCst  goes down as the element becomes more 
distorted.  To assure stability of time integration , the global LS-DYNA time 
step is the minimum of the ∆|u1D461|mCst|aCst|xCst  values calculated for all elements in the mod- 
el.  Using this option allows the selective deletio n of elements whose time step 
∆|u1D461|mCst|aCst|xCst  has fallen below the speciﬁed minimum time step, ∆|u1D461crit .  Elements 
which are severely distorted often indicate that ma terial has failed and sup- 
ports little load, but these same elements may have  very small time steps and 
therefore control the cost of the analysis.  This o ption allows these highly dis- 
torted elements to be deleted from the calculation,  and, therefore, the analysis 
can proceed at a larger time step, and, thus, at a reduced cost.  Deleted ele- 
ments do not carry any load and are deleted from al l applicable slide surface 
deﬁnitions.  Clearly, this option must be judicious ly used to obtain accurate 
results at a minimum cost. 
4.  Viscoplastic Formulation.   A fully viscoplastic formulation is optional whic h 
incorporates the rate formulation within the yield surface.  An additional cost 
is incurred but the improvement is results can be d ramatic. *MAT_RIGID  *MAT_020

This is Material 20.  Parts made from this material  are considered to belong to a rigid 
body (for each part ID).  The coupling of a rigid b ody with MADYMO and CAL3D can 
also be deﬁned using this material.  Alternatively,  a VDA surface can be attached as 
surface to model the geometry, such as for the tool ing in metal forming applications.  
Optional global and local constraints on the mass c enter can be deﬁned.  A local 
consideration for output and user-deﬁned airbag sen sors may also optionally be chosen.

where  the latter are given by the cross products /u1D41C=/u1D41A×/u1D42F and 
/u1D41B=/u1D41C×/u1D41A.  This input is optional. 
Remarks: 
1.  Rigid Material.  The rigid material type 20 provides a convenient w ay of 
turning one or more parts comprised of beams, shell s, or solid elements into a 
rigid body.  Approximating a deformable body as rig id is a preferred modeling 
technique in many real world applications.  For exa mple, in sheet metal form- 
ing problems the tooling can properly and accuratel y be treated as rigid.  In the 
design of restraint systems the occupant can, for t he purposes of early design 
studies, also be treated as rigid.  Elements which are rigid are bypassed in the 
element processing and no storage is allocated for storing history variables; 
consequently, the rigid material type is very cost eﬃcient. 
2.  Parts.   Two unique rigid part IDs may not share common no des unless they 
are merged together using the rigid body merge opti on.  A rigid body, howev- 
er, may be made up of disjoint ﬁnite element meshes .  LS-DYNA assumes this 
is the case since this is a common practice in sett ing up tooling meshes in form- 
ing problems. *MAT_RIGID  *MAT_020  
LS-DYNA R13 2-219 (MAT) All elements which reference a given part ID corres ponding to the rigid mate- 
rial should be contiguous, but this is not a requir ement.  If two disjoint groups 
of elements on opposite sides of a model are modele d as rigid, separate part 
IDs should be created for each of the contiguous el ement groups if each group 
is to move independently.  This requirement arises from the fact that LS-DYNA 
internally computes the six rigid body degrees-of-f reedom for each rigid body 
(rigid material or set of merged materials), and if  disjoint groups of rigid ele- 
ments use the same part ID, the disjoint groups wil l move together as one rigid 
body. 
3.  Inertial Properties.   Inertial properties for rigid materials may be de ﬁned in 
either of two ways.  By default, the inertial prope rties are calculated from the 
geometry of the constituent elements of the rigid m aterial and the density spec- 
iﬁed for the part ID.  Alternatively, the inertial properties and initial velocities 
for a rigid body may be directly deﬁned, and this o verrides data calculated 
from the material property deﬁnition and nodal init ial velocity deﬁnitions. 
4.  Contact and Material Constants.  Young's modulus, E, and Poisson's ratio, υ, 
are used for determining sliding interface paramete rs if the rigid body interacts 
in a contact deﬁnition.  Realistic values for these  constants should be deﬁned 
since unrealistic values may contribute to numerica l problems with contact. 
5.  Constraints.   Constraint directions for rigid materials (CMO eq ual to +1 or -1) 
are ﬁxed, that is, not updated, with time.  To impo se a constraint on a rigid 
body such that the constraint direction is updated as the rigid body rotates, use 
*BOUNDARY_PRESCRIBED_MOTION_RIGID_LOCAL. 
We strongly advise you not to apply nodal constrain ts, for instance, by 
*BOUNDARY_SPC_ OPTION , to nodes of a rigid body as doing so may com- 
promise the intended constraints in the case of an explicit simulation.  Such 
SPCs will be skipped in an implicit simulation and a warning issued.   
If the intended constraints are not with respect to  the calculated center-of-mass 
of the rigid body, *CONSTRAINED_JOINT_ OPTION  may often be used to 
obtain the desired eﬀect.  This approach typically entails deﬁning a second 
rigid body which is fully constrained and then deﬁn ing a joint between the two 
rigid bodies.  Another alternative for deﬁning rigi d body constraints that are 
not with respect to the calculated center-of-mass o f the rigid body is to manual- 
ly specify the initial center-of-mass location usin g *PART_INERTIA.  When 
using *PART_INERTIA, a full set of mass properties must be speciﬁed.  Note 
that the dynamic behavior of the rigid body, howeve r, is aﬀected by its mass 
properties. 
6.  Coupling with MADYMO.   Only basic coupling is available for coupling wit h 
MADYMO 5.4.1. The coupling ﬂags (N and M) must matc h with SYSTEM and *MAT_020  *MAT_RIGID

This model will predict realistic behavior for ﬁnit e displacement and rotations as long 
as the strains are small. 
 
In the implementation for shell elements, the stres ses are integrated in time and are 
updated in the corotational coordinate system.  In this procedure the local material axes 
are assumed to remain orthogonal in the deformed co nﬁguration.  This assumption is 
valid if the strains remain small. *MAT_021  *MAT_ORTHOTROPIC_THERMAL  
2-228 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13  
The failure models were derived by William Feng.  T he ﬁrst one deﬁnes the matrix 
dominated failure mode, 
|u1D439|u1D4JACst= |u1D434|oneCst(/u1D4:C|oneCst− 3) + |u1D434|oneCst|oneCst (/u1D4:C|oneCst− 3)|twoCst+ |u1D434|twoCst(/u1D4:C|twoCst− 3) − 1  , 
and the second deﬁnes the ﬁber dominated failure mo de, 
|u1D439/u1D45:.st= |u1D434|fiveCst(/u1D4:C|fiveCst− 1) + |u1D434|fiveCst|fiveCst (/u1D4:C|fiveCst− 1)|twoCst+ |u1D434|fourCst(/u1D4:C|fourCst− 1) − 1  . 
When either is greater than zero, the integration p oint fails, and the element is deleted 
after NIP integration points fail.

By convention in this material model, the ﬁber dire ction is aligned with the |u1D44∆ direction 
of the local orthotropic coordinate system.  
 
The curing option implies that orthotropic chemical  shrinkage is to be considered, 
resulting from a curing process in the material.  T he state of cure |u1D6FD is an internal 
material variable that follows the Kamal model

The coeﬃcients, |u1D6F∆|u1D44∆Cst, |u1D6F∆|u1D44FCst, and |u1D6F∆|u1D4J≠Cst, can be deﬁned as functions of the state of cure |u1D6FD.  
Furthermore, the coeﬃcients of thermal expansion, |u1D6F+|u1D44∆Cst, |u1D6F+|u1D44FCst, and |u1D6F+|u1D4J≠Cst, can also be deﬁned as 
functions of the state of cure, |u1D6FD, and the temperature, |u1D447, if the curing option is used.

This is  Material Type 22.  With this model, an orthotropic material with optional brittle 
failure for composites can be deﬁned following the suggestion of [Chang and Chang 
1987a, 1987b].  Failure can be modeled with three c riteria; see the LS-DYNA Theory 
Manual.  By using the user deﬁned integration rule (see *INTEGRATION_SHELL), the 
constitutive constants can vary through the shell t hickness. 
For all shells, except the DKT formulation, laminat ed shell theory can be activated to 
properly model the transverse shear deformation.  L amination theory is applied to 
correct for the assumption of a uniform constant sh ear strain through the thickness of 
the shell.  For sandwich shells where the outer lay ers are much stiﬀer than the inner 
layers, the response will tend to be too stiﬀ unles s lamination theory is used.  To turn on 
lamination theory, see *CONTROL_SHELL.

2.  The ATRACK Field.   The initial material directions are set using AOP T and the 
related data.  By default, the material directions in shell elements are updated 
each cycle based on the rotation of the 1-2 edge, o r else the rotation of all edges 
if the invariant node numbering option is set on *C ONTROL_ACCURACY.  
When ATRACK = 1, an optional scheme is used in whic h the |u1D44∆-direction of the 
material tracks element deformation as well as rota tion. 
At the start of the calculation, a line is passed t hrough each element center in 
the direction of the material |u1D44∆-axis.  This line will intersect the edges of the e l- 
ement at two points.  The referential coordinates o f these two points are stored 
and then used throughout the calculation to locate these points in the de- 
formed geometry.  The material |u1D44∆-axis is assumed to be in the direction of the 
line that passes through both points.  If ATRACK = 0, the layers of a layered 
composite will always rotate together.  However, if  ATRACK = 1, the layers 
 
4  ranges over the shell integration points. *MAT_COMPOSITE_DAMAGE  *MAT_022  
LS-DYNA R13 2-235 (MAT) can rotate independently which may be more accurate , particularly for shear 
deformation.  This option is available only for she ll elements. 
3.  Poisson’s Ratio.   If EA > EB, PRBA is the minor Poisson's ratio if EA > EB, 
and the major Poisson's ratio will be equal to PRBA × (EA EB ⁄ ) .  If EB > EA, 
then PRBA is the major Poisson's ratio.  PRCA and P RCB are similarly deﬁned.  
They are the minor Poisson’s ratio if EA>EC or EB>E C, and the major Pois- 
son’s ratio if the EC > EA or EC > EB. 
Care should be taken when using material parameters  from third party prod- 
ucts regarding the directional indices |u1D44∆, |u1D44F and  /u1D450, as they may diﬀer from the 
deﬁnition used in LS-DYNA. For the direction indice s used in LS-DYNA, see

This model will predict realistic behavior for ﬁnit e displacement and rotations as long 
as the strains are small. 
 
For shell elements, the stresses are integrated in time and are updated in the 
corotational coordinate system.  In this procedure the local material axes are assumed to 
remain orthogonal in the deformed conﬁguration.  Th is assumption is valid if the 
strains remain small. *MAT_024  *MAT_PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLASTICITY

This is  Material Type 24, which is an elasto-plastic materi al with an arbitrary stress as a 
function of strain curve and arbitrary strain rate dependency can be deﬁned (see 
Remarks below).  Failure based on a plastic strain or a minimum time step size can be 
deﬁned.  For another model with a more comprehensiv e failure criteria see 
MAT_MODIFIED_PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLASTICITY.  If consi dering laminated or 
sandwich shells with non-uniform material propertie s (this is deﬁned through the user 
speciﬁed integration rule), the model, MAT_LAYERED_ LINEAR_PLASTICITY, is 
recommended.  If solid elements are used and if the  elastic strains before yielding are 
ﬁnite, the model, *MAT_FINITE_ELASTIC_STRAIN_PLASTI CITY, treats the elastic 
strains using a hyperelastic formulation.  
The LOG_INTERPOLATION keyword option interpolates t he strain rates in a table LC-
SS with logarithmic interpolation.  
The STOCHASTIC keyword option allows spatially vary ing yield and failure behavior.  
See *DEFINE_STOCHASTIC_VARIATION for additional inf ormation. 
The MIDFAIL keyword option is available for thin sh ell elements and thick shell 
formulations which use thin shell material models.  When included on the keyword 
line, this option causes failure to be checked only  at the mid-plane of the element.  If an 
element has an even number of layers, failure is ch ecked in the two layers closest to the 
mid-plane. 
The 2D keyword option is available only for shell e lements.  It invokes actual plane 
stress treatment, meaning transverse shear stresses  are not part of the yield condition 
but updated elastically.

LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID 
Load Curve.   When LC SS is a load curve ID, it is taken as 
deﬁning eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀective p lastic strain.  If 
deﬁned, EPS1 - EPS8 and ES1 - ES8 are ignored.  See  Remark 7  for 
load curve rediscretization behavior. 
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the stress as a function eﬀect ive plastic strain 
for that rate; see Figure M24-1 .  When the strain rate falls below 
the mi nimum value, the stress as a function of eﬀective p lastic 
strain curve for the lowest value of strain rate is  used.  Likewise, 
when the strain rate exceeds the maximum value the stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain curve for the h ighest value of 
strain rate is used.  C, P, LCSR, EPS1 - EPS8, and ES1 - ES8 are 
ignored if a table ID is deﬁned.  Linear interpolat ion between the 
discrete strain rates is used by default; logarithm ic interpolation 
is used when the LOG_INTERPOLATION option is invoke d. 
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   Logarithmic interpolation 
between discrete strain rates is also assumed if th e ﬁrst  value in 
the table is negative, in which case LS-DY NA assumes that all the 
table values represent the natural logarithm of a s t rain rate.  Since 
the tables are internally discretized to equally sp ace the table 
values, it makes good sense from an accuracy standp oint that the 
table values represent the natural log of strain ra te when the 
lowest strain rate and highest strain rate di ﬀer by several orders 
of magnitude.  Note that this option works only whe n the lowest 
strain rate has value less than 1.0. For values gre ater than or equal 
to 1.0, use the LOG_INTERPOLA TION option.  There is some 
additional computational cost associa ted with invoking 
logarithmic interpolation.  *MAT_024  *MAT_PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLASTICITY  
2-246 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
Multi-Dimensional Tables.   With VP = 3, yield stress can be a 
function of plastic strain, strain rate, and up to seven history 
variables (see Remark 4 ). That means LCSS can refer to *DE-
FINE_TABLE_ XD or *DEFINE_TABLE_COM PACT up to a level 
of 9. 
LCSR Load curve ID deﬁning strain rate scaling eﬀect on yield stress.  If 
LC SR is negative, the load curve is evaluated using a  binary 
search for the corre ct interval for the strain rate.  The binary 
search is slower than the default incremental searc h, but in cases 
where large changes in the strain rate may occur ov er a single 
time step, it is more robust.  This option is not n ecessary for the 
viscoplastic formulation.  
VP Formulation for rate eﬀects: 
EQ.-1.0: Cowper- Symonds with eﬀective deviatoric strain rate 
rather than total 
EQ.0.0: Scale yield stress (default) 
EQ.1.0: Viscoplastic formulation 
EQ.3.0: Same as VP = 0, but with ﬁltered eﬀective total strain 
rates (see Remark 3 ) 
EPS1 - EPS8 Eﬀective plastic strain values (optional).  If used , at least 2 points 
should be deﬁned.  The ﬁrst point must be zero corresponding to 
the initial yield stress.  WARN ING: If the ﬁrst point is nonzero, 
the yield stress is extrapolated to determine the i nitial yield.  If 
this option is used, SIGY and ETAN are ignored and may be 
input as zero. 
ES1 - ES8 Corresponding yield stress values to EPS1  - EPS8 
Remarks: 
1.  Stress-Strain Behavior.   The stress-strain behavior may be treated by a 
bilinear stress strain curve by deﬁning the tangent  modulus, ETAN.  Alternate- 
ly, a curve of eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀe ctive plastic strain similar to 
that shown in Figure M10-1  may be deﬁned by (EPS1, ES1) - (EPS8, ES8); how- 
ever, a curve ID (LCSS) may be referenced instead i f eight points are insuﬃ- 
cient.  The cost is roughly the same for either app roach.  Note that in the 
special case of uniaxial stress, true stress as a f unction of true plastic strain is *MAT_PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLASTICITY  *MAT_024  
LS-DYNA R13 2-247 (MAT) equivalent to eﬀective stress as a function eﬀectiv e plastic strain.  The most 
general approach is to use the table deﬁnition (LCS S) discussed below. 
Three options to account for strain rate eﬀects are  possible: 
a)  Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model 
which scales the yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  , 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate.  |u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst .  If VP = -1, the deviatoric strain rates 
are used instead. 
If the viscoplastic option is active (VP = 1.0) and  if SIGY is > 0 then the 
dynamic yield stress is computed from the sum of th e static stress, 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2, which is typically given by a load curve ID and t he initial yield 
stress, SIGY, multiplied by the Cowper-Symonds rate  term as follows: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 + SIG Y × |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst
|u1D436|parenriµhtCv6|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  . 
Here the plastic strain rate is used.  With this la tter approach similar re- 
sults to *MAT_ANISOTROPIC_VISCOPLASTIC can be obtai ned.  If SI- 
GY = 0, the following equation is used instead wher e the static stress, 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2, must be deﬁned by a load curve: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2
⎣⎢⎢⎡1 + |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst
|u1D436|parenriµhtCv6|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
⎦⎥⎥⎤  . 
This latter equation is always used if the viscopla stic option is oﬀ. 
b)  For complete generality a load curve (LCSR) to sca le the yield stress may 
be input instead.  In this curve the scale factor a s a function of strain rate is 
deﬁned. 
c)  If diﬀerent stress as a function of strain curves can be provided for various 
strain rates, the option using the reference to a t able (LCSS) can be used.  
Then the table input in *DEFINE_TABLE must be used; see Figure M24-1 . 
2.  Viscoplastic Formulation.   A fully viscoplastic formulation is optional 
(variable VP = 1) which incorporates the diﬀerent o ptions above within the 
yield surface.  An additional cost is incurred over  the simple scaling, but the 
improvement in results can be dramatic. 
3.  Filtered Strain Rates.   With the option VP = 3 it is possible to use ﬁlte red 
strain rates.  This means that the total strain rat e is used as with VP = 0, but this *MAT_024  *MAT_PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLASTICITY  
2-248 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 can now be ﬁltered with the help of ﬁeld C (not Cow per-Symonds in this case) 
and the following exponential moving average equati on: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCsta v g = C × |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst−|oneCsta v g + (1 − C) × |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst  
This might be helpful if a table LCSS with crossing  yield curves is used. 
4.  Yield Stress Depending on History Variables.   When VP = 3, the yield stress 
deﬁned with LCSS can depend on up to seven history variables through a mul- 
ti-dimensional table.  These seven history variable s are history variables 6 
through 12 which you will have to set using *INITIA L_HISTORY_NODE or 
*INITIAL_STRESS_SOLID/SHELL and whose meanings are,  therefore, deter- 
mined by you.  For instance, you can set the values  of history variables 6, 9, 
and 10 for certain nodes and have the value of yiel d stress depend upon histo- 
ry variables 6, 9, and 10. Note that these history variables are only initialized 
and do not evolve in time.  See *DEFINE_TABLE_ XD or *DEFINE_TABLE_-
COMPACT for more details. 
5.  Implicit Calculations.   For implicit calculations with this material invo lving 
severe nonlinear hardening, the radial return metho d may result in inaccurate 
stress-strain response.  Setting IACC = 1 on *CONTR OL_ACCURACY acti- 
vates a fully iterative plasticity algorithm, which  will remedy this.  This is not 
to be confused with the MITER ﬂag on *CONTROL_SHELL  which governs the 
treatment of the plane stress assumption for shell elements.  If failure is ap- 
plied with this option, incident failure will initi ate damage, and the stress will 
continuously degrade to zero before erosion for a d eformation of 1% plastic 
strain.  So for instance, if the failure strain is FAIL = 0.05 , then the element is 
eroded when |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.06  and the material goes from intact to completely da m- 
aged between |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.05  and |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.06 . The reason is to enhance implicit per- 
formance by maintaining continuity in the internal forces. 
6.  Failure Output.   For a nonzero failure strain, *DEFINE_MATERIAL_HI STO-
RIES can be used to output the failure indicator.

LS-DYNA R13 2-251 (MAT) Remarks: 
The implementation of an extended two-invariant cap  model, suggested by Stojko 
[1990], is based on the formulations of Simo, et al .  [1988, 1990] and Sandler and Rubin 
[1979].  In this model, the two-invariant cap theor y is extended to include nonlinear 
kinematic hardening as suggested by Isenberg, Vaugh an, and Sandler [1978].  A brief 
discussion of the extended cap model and its parame ters is given below.  
 
The cap model is formulated in terms of the invaria nts of the stress tensor.  The square 
root of the second invariant of the deviatoric stre ss tensor, /radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st is found from the 
deviatoric stresses /u1D42C as 
/radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st≡/radical.v51
2|u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
and is the objective scalar measure of the distorti onal or shearing stress.  The ﬁrst 
invariant of the stress, /u1D4:D|oneCst, is the trace of the stress tensor. 
 
The cap model consists of three surfaces in /radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st−/u1D4:D|oneCst space, as shown in Figure M25-1   
First, there is a failure envelope surface, denoted  |u1D4J3|oneCst in the ﬁgure.  The functional form of 
|u1D4J3|oneCst is 
|u1D4J3|oneCst=/radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st− min[|u1D439|u1D4J2Cst(/u1D4:D|oneCst), |u1D447mises ], 
where |u1D439|u1D4J2Cst is given by 
|u1D439|u1D4J2Cst(/u1D4:D|oneCst)≡|u1D6F+ − |u1D6F∆exp|parenleftCv1−|u1D6FD/u1D4:D|oneCst|parenriµhtCv1 +/u1D̅0:/u1D4:D|oneCst TO κf1

and therefore, does not harden unless kinematic har dening is present.  Next, there is a 
cap surface, denoted |u1D4J3|twoCst in the ﬁgure, with |u1D4J3|twoCst given by 
|u1D4J3|twoCst=/radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st− |u1D439|u1D4J≠Cst(/u1D4:D|oneCst, |u1D43∆) 
where |u1D439|u1D4J≠Cst is deﬁned by 
|u1D439|u1D4J≠Cst(/u1D4:D|oneCst,/u1D̅05)≡1
|u1D44J/radical.v2[/u1D44B(/u1D̅05) −/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05)]|twoCst− [/u1D4:D|oneCst−/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05)]|twoCst, 
/u1D44B(/u1D̅05) is the intersection of the cap surface with the /u1D4:D|oneCst axis 
/u1D44B(/u1D̅05) =/u1D̅05+ |u1D44J|u1D439|u1D4J2Cst(/u1D̅05), 
and /u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) is deﬁned by  
/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05)≡|<raceleftCv4/u1D̅05   if   /u1D̅05> 0
0   if   /u1D̅05≤ 0 
The hardening parameter /u1D̅05 is related to the plastic volume change |u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst|u1D4JDCst through the 
hardening law 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst|u1D4JDCst=/u1D44A/˙raceleft.v11 − exp[−|u1D437(/u1D44B(/u1D̅05) −/u1D44B|zeroCst)]/˙raceright.v1 
Geometrically, /u1D̅05 is seen in the ﬁgure as the /u1D4:D|oneCst coordinate of the intersection of the cap 
surface and the failure surface.  Finally, there is  the tension cutoﬀ surface, denoted |u1D4J3|threeCst in 
the ﬁgure.  The function |u1D4J3|threeCst is given by  
|u1D4J3|threeCst≡|u1D447 −/u1D4:D|oneCst 
where |u1D447 is the input material parameter which speciﬁes the  maximum hydrostatic 
tension sustainable by the material.  The elastic d omain in /radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st−/u1D4:D|oneCst space is then 
bounded by the failure envelope surface above, the tension cutoﬀ surface on the left, 
and the cap surface on the right. 
 
An additive decomposition of the strain into elasti c and plastic parts is assumed: 
/u1D6C6=/u1D6C6|u1D4J2Cst+/u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst , 
where /u1D6C6|u1D4J2Cst is the elastic strain and /u1D6C6|u1D4JDCstis the plastic strain.  Stress is found from the el astic 
strain using Hooke’s law, 
/u1D6D4=/u1D402(/u1D6C6 −/u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst), 
where /u1D6D4 is the stress and /u1D402 is the elastic constitutive tensor. 
 
The yield condition may be written 
|u1D4J3|oneCst(|u1D46≠) ≤ 0
|u1D4J3|twoCst(|u1D46≠,/u1D̅05) ≤ 0
|u1D4J3|threeCst(|u1D46≠) ≤ 0 
and the plastic consistency condition requires that  *MAT_GEOLOGIC_CAP_MODEL  *MAT_025  
LS-DYNA R13 2-253 (MAT) |u1D7≠6̇|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J3|u1D4J8Cst= 0
/u1D458= 1,2,3
|u1D7≠6̇|u1D4J8Cst≥ 0 
where |u1D7≠6|u1D4J8Cst is the plastic consistency parameter for surface /u1D458.  If |u1D4J3|u1D4J8Cst< 0 then, |u1D7≠6̇|u1D4J8Cst= 0 and the 
response is elastic.  If |u1D4J3|u1D4J8Cst> 0 then surface /u1D458 is active and |u1D7≠6̇|u1D4J8Cst is found from the 
requirement that |u1D4J3̇|u1D4J8Cst= 0. 
 
Associated plastic ﬂow is assumed, so using Koiter’ s ﬂow rule, the plastic strain rate is 
given as the sum of contribution from all of the ac tive surfaces, 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst= |summationCv1 |u1D7≠6̇|u1D4J8Cst|threeCst
|u1D4J8Cst=|oneCst∂|u1D4J3|u1D4J8Cst
∂|u1D46≠  . 
One of the major advantages of the cap model over o ther classical pressure-dependent 
plasticity models is the ability to control the amo unt of dilatancy produced under shear 
loading.  Dilatancy is produced under shear loading  as a result of the yield surface 
having a positive slope in /radical.v1/u1D4:D|twoCst/u1D4:̅.st−/u1D4:D space, so the assumption of plastic ﬂow in the 
direction normal to the yield surface produces a pl astic strain rate vector that has a 
component in the volumetric (hydrostatic) direction  (see Figure M25-1 ).  In models such 
as the Drucker-Prager and Mohr-Coulomb, this dilata ncy continues as long as shear 
loads are applied, and in many cases produces far m ore dilatancy than is experimental- 
ly observed in material tests.  In the cap model, w hen the failure surface is active, 
dilatancy is produced just as with the Drucker-Prag er and Mohr-Coulumb models.  
However, the hardening law permits the cap surface to contract until the cap intersects 
the failure envelope at the stress point, and the c ap remains at that point.  The local 
normal to the yield surface is now vertical, and th erefore the normality rule assures that 
no further plastic volumetric strain (dilatancy) is  created.  Adjustment of the parameters 
that control the rate of cap contractions permits e xperimentally observed amounts of 
dilatancy to be incorporated into the cap model, th us producing a constitutive law 
which better represents the physics to be modeled. 
 
Another advantage of the cap model over other model s such as the Drucker-Prager and 
Mohr-Coulomb is the ability to model plastic compac tion.  In these models all purely 
volumetric response is elastic.  In the cap model, volumetric response is elastic until the 
stress point hits the cap surface.  Therefore, plas tic volumetric strain (compaction) is 
generated at a rate controlled by the hardening law .  Thus, in addition to controlling the 
amount of dilatancy, the introduction of the cap su rface adds another experimentally 
observed response characteristic of geological mate rial into the model. 
 
The inclusion of kinematic hardening results in hys teretic energy dissipation under 
cyclic loading conditions.  Following the approach of Isenberg, et al.  [1978] a nonlinear 
kinematic hardening law is used for the failure env elope surface when nonzero values 
of /u1D450̅ and /u1D441 are speciﬁed.  In this case, the failure envelope surface is replaced by a family 
of yield surfaces bounded by an initial yield surfa ce and a limiting failure envelope *MAT_025  *MAT_GEOLOGIC_CAP_MODEL  
2-254 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 surface.  Thus, the shape of the yield surfaces des cribed above remains unchanged, but 
they may translate in a plane orthogonal to the /u1D4:D axis, 
 
Translation of the yield surfaces is permitted thro ugh the introduction of a “back stress” 
tensor, /u1D6C2. The formulation including kinematic hardening is obtained by replacing the 
stress /u1D6D4 with the translated stress tensor |u1D7≠2≡|u1D7≠∆ − |u1D6F+  in all of the above equations.  The 
history tensor /u1D6C2 is assumed deviatoric and therefore has only 5 uni que components.  
The evolution of the back stress tensor is governed  by the nonlinear hardening law 
|u1D6F+ =/u1D450̅|u1D439̅(|u1D7≠∆, |u1D6F+)|u1D4J2̇|u1D4JDCst 
where /u1D450̅ is a constant, |u1D439̅ is a scalar function of /u1D6D4 and /u1D6C2  and |u1D4J2̇|u1D4JDCst is the rate of deviatoric 
plastic strain.  The constant may be estimated from  the slope of the shear stress - plastic 
shear strain curve at low levels of shear stress. 
 
The function |u1D439̅ is deﬁned as 
|u1D439̅≡max |<racketleftCvJ0,1 −(|u1D7≠∆ − |u1D6F+)|u1D6F+
2/u1D441|u1D439|u1D4J2Cst(/u1D4:D|oneCst)|<racketriµhtCvJ  , 
where /u1D441 is a constant deﬁning the size of the yield surfac e.  The value of /u1D441 may be 
interpreted as the radial distant between the outsi de of the initial yield surface and the 
inside of the limit surface.  In order for the limi t surface of the kinematic hardening cap 
model to correspond with the failure envelope surfa ce of the standard cap model, the 
scalar parameter |u1D6F+ must be replaced |u1D6F+ −/u1D441 in the deﬁnition |u1D439|u1D4J2Cst. 
 
The cap model contains a number of parameters which  must be chosen to represent a 
particular material and are generally based on expe rimental data.  The parameters |u1D6F+, |u1D6FD, 
/u1D̅0:, and |u1D6F∆ are usually evaluated by ﬁtting a curve through fa ilure data taken from a set of 
triaxial compression tests.  The parameters /u1D44A, |u1D437, and /u1D44B|zeroCst deﬁne the cap hardening law.  
The value /u1D44A represents the void fraction of the uncompressed s ample and |u1D437 governs 
the slope of the initial loading curve in hydrostat ic compression.  The value of |u1D44J is the 
ratio of major to minor axes of the quarter ellipse  deﬁning the cap surface.  Additional 
details and guidelines for ﬁtting the cap model to experimental data are found in Chen 
and Baladi [1985]. *MAT_HONEYCOMB  *MAT_026

Remarks: 
1.  Stress Load Curves.   For eﬃciency it is strongly recommended that the load 
curves with IDs LCA, LCB, LCC, LCS, LCAB, LCBC, and  LCCA contain exact- 
ly the same number of points with corresponding str ain values on the abscissa.  
If this recommendation is followed the cost of the table lookup is insigniﬁcant.  
Conversely, the cost increases signiﬁcantly if the abscissa strain values are not 
consistent between load curves. *MAT_HONEYCOMB  *MAT_026  
LS-DYNA R13 2-259 (MAT) The load curves deﬁne the magnitude of the average stress as the material 
changes density (relative volume); see Figure M26-1 . There are two ways to 
deﬁne these curves, (1) as a function of relative v olume, |u1D449, or (2)  as a function 
of volumetric strain deﬁned as: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D449Cst= 1 − |u1D449  . 
In the former case, the ﬁrst value in the curve sho uld correspond to a value of 
relative volume slightly less than the fully compac ted value.  In the latter, the 
ﬁrst value in the curve should be less than or equa l to zero, corresponding to 
tension, and increase to full compaction. Care should be taken when deﬁning the 
curves so that extrapolated values do not lead to n egative yield stresses. 
2.  Elastic/Shear Moduli during Compaction.   The behavior before compaction 
is orthotropic where the components of the stress t ensor are uncoupled, mean- 
ing an |u1D44∆ component of strain will generate resistance in th e local |u1D44∆-direction 
with no coupling to the local |u1D44F and /u1D450 directions.  The elastic moduli vary, from 
their initial values to the fully compacted values at |u1D449/u1D45:.st, linearly with the rela- 
tive volume |u1D449: 0Curve extends into negative volumetric 
strain quadrant since LS-DYNA will 
extrapolate using the two end points. It 
is important that the extropolation 
does not extend into the negative 
unloading and
reloading path
Unloading is based on the interpolated Young’s 
moduli which must provide an unloading tangent 
that exceeds the loading tangent. σij

stress” at a volumetric strain of zero is non- zero.  In the load curve deﬁnition,

|u1D43A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst = |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D462Cst + |u1D6FD(|u1D43A − |u1D43A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D462Cst ) 
where 
|u1D6FD = max |<racketleftCv6min |parenleftCv61 − |u1D449

and |u1D43A is the elastic shear modulus for the fully compact ed honeycomb material 
|u1D43A =|u1D438
2(1 + |u1D463). 
The relative volume, |u1D449, is deﬁned as the ratio of the current volume to t he ini- 
tial volume.  Typically, |u1D449 = 1  at the beginning of a calculation.  The viscosity 
coeﬃcient |u1D7≠7 (MU) should be set to a small number (usually .02 - .10 is okay).  
Alternatively, the two bulk viscosity coeﬃcients on  the control cards should be 
set to very small numbers to prevent the developmen t of spurious pressures 
that may lead to undesirable and confusing results.   The latter is not recom- 
mended since spurious numerical noise may develop. 
3.  Stress Updates.   At the beginning of the stress update each elemen t’s stresses 
and strain rates are transformed into the local ele ment coordinate system.  For 
the uncompacted material, the trial stress componen ts are updated using the 
elastic interpolated moduli (see Remark 2 ) according to: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial = |u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst |u1D4JBCst+ |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial = |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst |u1D4JBCst+ |u1D438|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst |u1D4JBCst+ |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial = |u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst |u1D4JBCst+ 2|u1D43A|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial = |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst |u1D4JBCst+ 2|u1D43A|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst |u1D4JBCst+1trial = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst |u1D4JBCst+ 2|u1D43A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst  
Each component of the updated stresses is then inde pendently checked to en- 
sure that they do not exceed the permissible values  determined from the load 
curves; for example, if 
/divides.v4|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial /divides.v4> |u1D7≠6|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst (|u1D449)  , 
then *MAT_HONEYCOMB  *MAT_026  
LS-DYNA R13 2-261 (MAT) |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst (|u1D449)|u1D7≠6|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial 
/divides.v:|u1D7≠6|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial /divides.v:  . 
The stress components are found using the curves de ﬁned on Card 2.  The pa- 
rameter |u1D7≠6 is either unity or a value taken from the load cur ve number, LCSR, 
that deﬁnes |u1D7≠6 as a function of strain-rate.  Strain-rate is deﬁn ed here as the 
Euclidean norm of the deviatoric strain-rate tensor . 
For fully compacted material it is assumed that the  material behavior is elastic-
perfectly plastic and the stress components updated  according to: 
|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst trial = |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+ 2|u1D43A∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D451.st |u1D4J2Cst|u1D463Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst
|twoCst/fraction.v2  , 
where the deviatoric strain increment is deﬁned as 
∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst de v = ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst −1
3∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   . 
Now a check is made to see if the yield stress for the fully compacted material 
is exceeded by comparing the eﬀective trial stress,  
|u1D46≠eff trial = |parenleftCvJ3
2|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst trial |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst trial |parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2
  ,   
to the deﬁned yield stress, SIGY.  If the eﬀective trial stress exceeds the yield 
stress the stress components are simply scaled back  to the yield surface 
|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst=|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst
|u1D46≠eff trial |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst trial . 
Now the pressure is updated using the elastic bulk modulus, |u1D43∆, 
|u1D4JD|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D4JD|u1D4JBCst− |u1D43∆∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2 
where  
|u1D43∆ =|u1D438
3(1 − 2|u1D463) 
to obtain the ﬁnal value for the Cauchy stress 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst− |u1D4JD|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   . 
After completing the stress the stresses are transf ormed back to the global con- 
ﬁguration.

place of the change in gauge length and the nominal  (engineering) stress in place of the 
force; see Figure M27-1 . 
 
The least square ﬁt to the experimental data is per formed during the initialization 
phase, and a comparison between the ﬁt and the actu al input is provided in the d3hsp  
ﬁle.  It is a good idea to visually check to make s ure it is acceptable.  The coeﬃcients |u1D434 
and |u1D43J are also printed in the output ﬁle.  It is also ad vised to use the material driver (see 
Appendix K) for checking out the material model.

This is  Material Type 28.  It deﬁnes resultant formulation for beam and shell elements 
including elasto-plastic behavior.  This model is a vailable for the Belytschko-Schwer 
beam, the C o triangular shell, the Belytschko-Tsay shell, and t he fully integrated type 16 
shell.  For beams, the treatment is elastic-perfect ly plastic, but for shell elements 
isotropic hardening is approximately modeled.  For a detailed description we refer to 
the LS-DYNA Theory Manual.  Since the stresses are not computed in the resultant 
formulation, the stresses output to the binary data bases for the resultant elements are 
zero.

Remarks: 
1.  Load Curves.   This material model is available for the Belytsch ko resultant 
beam element only.  Plastic hinges form at the ends  of the beam when the mo- 
ment reaches the plastic moment.  The moment as a f unction rotation relation- 
ship is speciﬁed by the user in the form of a load curve and scale factor.  The 
points of the load curve are |parenleftCv1plastic rotation in radians, plastic moment|parenriµhtCv1 .  Both 
quantities should be positive for all points, with the ﬁrst point being 
|parenleftCv10.0, initial plastic moment|parenriµhtCv1 .  Within this constraint any form of characteristi c 
may be used, including ﬂat or falling curves.  Diﬀe rent load curves and scale 
factors may be speciﬁed at each node and about each  of the local |u1D46≠ and |u1D461 axes. 
Axial collapse occurs when the compressive axial lo ad reaches the collapse 
load.  Collapse load as a function of collapse deﬂe ction is speciﬁed in the form 
of a load curve.  The points of the load curve are either 
|parenleftCv1true strain, collapse force|parenriµhtCv1  or |parenleftCv1change in length, collapse force|parenriµhtCv1 .  Both quanti- *MAT_FORCE_LIMITED  *MAT_029  
LS-DYNA R13 2-271 (MAT) ties should be entered as positive for all points a nd will be interpreted as com- 
pressive.  The ﬁrst point should be |parenleftCv10.0, initial collapse load|parenriµhtCv1 . 
The collapse load may vary with end moment as well as with deﬂections.  In 
this case several load-deﬂection curves are deﬁned,  each corresponding to a 
diﬀerent end moment.  Each load curve should have t he same number of 
points and the same deﬂection values.  The end mome nt is deﬁned as the aver- 
age of the absolute moments at each end of the beam  and is always positive. 
2.  Damping.   Stiﬀness-proportional damping may be added using the damping 
factor |u1D7≠6.  This is deﬁned as follows: 
|u1D7≠6 =2 ×/u1D̅0∫
|u1D714 
where /u1D̅0∫ is the damping factor at the reference frequency |u1D714 (in radians per sec- 
ond).  For example if 1% damping at 2Hz is required  
|u1D7≠6 =2 × 0.01 
2/u1D̅0B× 2= 0.0015 92  . 
If damping is used, a small timestep may be require d.  LS-DYNA does not 
check this, so to avoid instability it may be neces sary to control the timestep 
using a load curve.  As a guide, the timestep requi red for any given element is 
multiplied by 0.3/u1D4:F/u1D450|u1D7≠6 ⁄ when damping is present ( /u1D4:F = element length, /u1D450 = sound 
speed). 
3.  Moment Interaction.   Plastic hinges can form due to the combined actio n of 
moments about the three axes.  This facility is act ivated only when yield mo- 
ments are deﬁned in the material input.  A hinge fo rms when the following 
condition is ﬁrst satisﬁed: 
⎝⎜⎛|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst
|u1D44≠ryield ⎠⎟⎞|twoCst
+
⎝⎜⎛|u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst
|u1D44≠syield ⎠⎟⎞|twoCst
+
⎝⎜⎛|u1D44≠|u1D461Cst
|u1D44≠tyield ⎠⎟⎞|twoCst
≥ 1  , 
where 
|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst,  |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst,  |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst= current moment 
|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstyield , |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cstyield , |u1D44≠|u1D461Cstyield = yield moment  
Note that scale factors for hinge behavior deﬁned i n the input will also be ap- 
plied to the yield moments:  for example, |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cstyield  in the above formula is given 
by the input yield moment about the local axis time s the input scale factor for 
the local |u1D46≠ axis.  For strain-softening characteristics, the y ield moment should 
generally be set equal to the initial peak of the m oment-rotation load curve. 
On forming a hinge, upper limit moments are set.  T hese are given by *MAT_029  *MAT_FORCE_LIMITED  
2-272 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstupper = max 
⎝⎜⎛|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst,|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstyield 
2⎠⎟⎞ 
and similar conditions hold for |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cstupper  and |u1D44≠|u1D461Cstupper . 
Thereafter, the plastic moments will be given by 
|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JDCst= min(|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstupper , |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstcur v e ) 
where |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JDCsts is the current plastic moment and |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstcur v e  is the moment from the 
load curve at the current rotation scaled by the sc ale factor.  |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D4JDCstand |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst|u1D4JDCst satisfy 
similar conditions. M1M1M2M3M4M5M6M7M8

Figure M29-1.  The force magnitude is limited by the applied end mom ent.  
For an intermediate value of the end moment LS-DY NA interpolates between 
the curves to determine the allowable force value. *MAT_FORCE_LIMITED  *MAT_029  
LS-DYNA R13 2-273 (MAT) The eﬀect of this is to provide an upper limit to t he moment that can be gener- 
ated; it represents the softening eﬀect of local bu ckling at a hinge site.  Thus if a 
member is bent about is local |u1D46≠-axis it will then be weaker in torsion and about 
its local |u1D461-axis.  For moment-softening curves, the eﬀect is t o trim oﬀ the initial 
peak (although if the curves subsequently harden, t he ﬁnal hardening will also 
be trimmed oﬀ). 
It is not possible to make the plastic moment vary with axial load. *MAT_030  *MAT_SHAPE_MEMORY

Remarks: 
The constants can be deﬁned directly or a least squ ares ﬁt can be performed if the 
uniaxial data (SGL, SW, ST and LCID) is available.  If a least squares ﬁt is chosen, then the 
terms to be included in the energy functional are ﬂ agged by setting their corresponding 
coeﬃcients to unity.   If all coeﬃcients are zero, the default is to use  only the terms 
involving /u1D4:C|oneCst and /u1D4:C|twoCst.  |u1D436|oneCst|zeroCst|zeroCst  defaults to unity if the least square ﬁt is used. 
 
The strain energy functional, U, is deﬁned in terms  of the input constants as: 
/u1D448= |u1D436|oneCst|zeroCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|oneCst+ |u1D436|twoCst|zeroCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|oneCst|twoCst+ |u1D436|threeCst|zeroCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|oneCst|threeCst+ |u1D436|fourCst|zeroCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|oneCst|fourCst+ |u1D436|oneCst|oneCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|oneCst/u1D4:C|twoCst+ |u1D436|twoCst|oneCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|oneCst|twoCst/u1D4:C|twoCst+ |u1D436|zeroCst|oneCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|twoCst+ |u1D436|zeroCst|twoCst|zeroCst /u1D4:C|twoCst|twoCst+ |u1D4J3 (/u1D4:D)  , 
where the invariants can be expressed in terms of t he deformation gradient matrix, |u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , 
and the Green-St.  Venant strain tensor,  |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst : 
/u1D4:D=|dividesCv2|u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |dividesCv2
/u1D4:C|oneCst= |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J6Cst

The derivative of /u1D448 with respect to a component of strain gives the co rresponding 
component of stress 
|u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =∂/u1D448
∂|u1D438|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   . 
Here, |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  is the second Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress tensor. 
 
The load curve deﬁnition that provides the uniaxial  data should give the change in 
gauge length, ∆/u1D4:F, and the corresponding force.  In compression both  the force and the 
change in gauge length must be speciﬁed as negative  values.  In tension the force and 
change in gauge length should be input as positive values.  The principal stretch ratio in 
the uniaxial direction, |u1D7≠6|oneCst, is then given by 
|u1D7≠6 =/u1D4:F/u1D45C.st+ ∆/u1D4:F
/u1D4:F/u1D45C.st 
Alternatively, the stress as a function of strain c urve can also be input by setting the 
gauge length, thickness, and width to unity and deﬁ ning the engineering strain in place 
of the change in gauge length and the nominal (engi neering) stress in place of the force; *MAT_FRAZER_NASH_RUBBER_MODEL  *MAT_031  
LS-DYNA R13 2-283 (MAT) see Figure M27-2  The least square ﬁt to the experimental data is pe rformed during the 
initialization phase, and a comparison between the ﬁt and the actual input is provided 
in the printed ﬁle.  It is a good idea to visually check the ﬁt to make sure it is acceptable.  
The coeﬃcients |u1D436|oneCst|zeroCst|zeroCst  through |u1D436|zeroCst|twoCst|zeroCst  are also printed in the output ﬁle. *MAT_032  *MAT_LAMINATED_GLASS

Remarks: 
Isotropic hardening for both materials is assumed.  The material to which the glass is 
bonded is assumed to stretch plastically without fa ilure.  A user deﬁned integration rule 
speciﬁes the thickness of the layers making up the glass.  F i deﬁnes whether the 
integration point is glass (0.0) or polymer (1.0).  The material deﬁnition, F i, must be 
given for the same number of integration points (NI PTS) as speciﬁed in the rule.  A 
maximum of 32 layers is allowed. 
If the recommended user deﬁned rule is not deﬁned, the default integration rules are 
used.  The location of the integration points in th e default rules are deﬁned in the *SEC-

The yield stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst is deﬁned three ways.  The ﬁrst, the Swift equatio n, is given in terms 
of the input constants as: *MAT_033_96  *MAT_BARLAT_YLD96

The third option is to give a load curve ID that de ﬁnes the yield stress as a function of 
eﬀective plastic strain.   
 
The yield function Φ is deﬁned as: 
Φ= |u1D6F+|oneCst||u1D46≠|oneCst− |u1D46≠|twoCst||u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D6F+|twoCst|dividesCv1|u1D46≠|twoCst− |u1D46≠|threeCst|dividesCv1|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D6F+|threeCst|dividesCv1|u1D46≠|threeCst− |u1D46≠|oneCst|dividesCv1|u1D44∆Cst= 2|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D44∆Cst  ,

LS-DYNA R13 2-295 (MAT) *MAT_FABRIC  
This is  Material Type 34.  This material is especially deve loped for airbag materials.  
The fabric model is a variation on the layered orth otropic composite model of material 
22 and is valid for 3 and 4 node membrane elements only. 
 
In addition to being a constitutive model, this mod el also invokes a special membrane 
element formulation which is more suited to the def ormation experienced by fabrics 
under large deformation.  For thin fabrics, bucklin g can result in an inability to support 
compressive stresses; thus a ﬂag is included for th is option.  A linearly elastic liner is 
also included which can be used to reduce the tende ncy for these elements to be 
crushed when the no-compression option is invoked.  In LS-DYNA versions after 931 
the isotropic elastic option is available.

Remarks: 
1.  The Compressive Stress Elimination Option for Airba g Wrinkling.   Setting 
CSE = 1 switches oﬀ compressive stress in the fabri c, thereby eliminating wrin- 
kles.  Without this “no compression” option, the ge ometry of the bag’s wrin- 
kles controls the amount of mesh reﬁnement.  In eli minating the wrinkles, this 
feature reduces the number of elements needed to at tain an accurate solution. *MAT_FABRIC  *MAT_034  
LS-DYNA R13 2-315 (MAT) The no compression option can allow elements to col lapse to a line which can 
lead to elements becoming tangled.  The elastic lin er option is one way to add 
some stiﬀness in compression to prevent this, see Remark 4 .  Alternatively, 
when using fabric formulations 14, -14, or 24 (see FORM) tangling can be re- 
duced by deﬁning stress/strain curves that include negative strain and stress 
values.  See Remark 6 . 
2.  Porosity.   The parameters FLC and FAC are optional for the W ang-Nefske and 
Hybrid inﬂation models.  It is possible for the air bag to be constructed of mul- 
tiple fabrics having diﬀerent values for porosity a nd permeability.  Typically, 
FLC and FAC must be determined experimentally and t heir variations in time 
or with pressure are optional to allow for maximum ﬂexibility. 
3.  Effects of Airbag-Structure Interaction on Porosity .   To calculate the 
leakage of gas through the fabric it is necessary t o accurately determine the 
leakage area.  The dynamics of the airbag may cause  the leakage area to change 
during the course of the simulation.  In particular , the deformation may change 
the leakage area, but the leakage area may also dec rease when the contact be- 
tween the airbag and the structure blocks the ﬂow.  LS-DYNA can check the 
interaction of the bag with the structure and split  the areas into regions that are 
blocked and unblocked depending on whether the regi ons are in or not in con- 
tact, respectively.  Blockage eﬀects may be control led with the ELA ﬁeld. 
4.  Elastic Liner.   An optional elastic liner can be deﬁned using EL,  PRL and LRA-
TIO.  The liner is an isotropic layer that acts in both tension and compression.  
However, setting, LNRC to 1.0 eliminates compressiv e stress in the liner until 
both principle stresses are tensile.  The compressi ve stress elimination option, 
CSE = 1 , has no inﬂuence on the liner behavior. 
5.  Fiber Axes.   For formulations 0, 1, and 2, (see FORM) the |u1D44∆-axis and |u1D44F-axis 
ﬁber directions are assumed to be orthogonal  and are completely deﬁned by the 
material axes option, AOPT = 0, 2, or 3.  For FORM = 3, 4, 13, or 14, the ﬁber 
directions are not assumed to be orthogonal  and must be speciﬁed using the 
ICOMP = 1 option on *SECTION_SHELL.  Oﬀset angles s hould be input into 
the B1 and B2 ﬁelds used normally for integration p oints 1 and 2.  The |u1D44∆-axis 
and |u1D44F-axis directions will then be oﬀset from the |u1D44∆-axis direction as determined 
by the material axis option, AOPT = 0, 2, or 3. 
When reference geometry is deﬁned, the material axe s are computed using 
coordinates from the reference geometry.  The mater ial axes are determined by 
computing the angle between the element system and the material direction. 
6.  Stress as a function of Strain Curves.   For formulations (see FORM) 4, 14, -
14, and 24, 2 nd  Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress as a function of Green’s str ain curves may 
be deﬁned for |u1D44∆-axis, |u1D44F-axis, and shear stresses for loading and also for unload- 
ing and reloading.  Alternatively, the |u1D44∆-axis and |u1D44F-axis curves can be input us- *MAT_034  *MAT_FABRIC  
2-316 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 ing engineering stress as a function of strain by s etting DATYP = -2 on *DE-
FINE_CURVE. 
Additionally, for formulations 14, -14, and 24, the  uniaxial loading curves LCA 
and LCB may be deﬁned for negative values of strain  and stress, that is, a 
straightforward extension of the curves into the co mpressive region.  This is 
available for modeling the compressive stresses res ulting from tight folding of 
airbags. 
The |u1D44∆-axis and |u1D44F-axis stress follow the curves for the entire deﬁne d strain re- 
gion and if compressive behavior is desired the use r should preferably make 
sure the curve covers all strains of interest.  For  strains below the ﬁrst point on 
the curve, the curve is extrapolated using the stiﬀ ness from the constant values, 
EA  or  EB.  
Shear stress/strain behavior is assumed symmetric a nd curves should be de- 
ﬁned for positive strain only.  However, formulatio ns 14, -14, and 24 allow the 
extending of the curves in the negative strain regi on to model asymmetric be- 
havior.  The asymmetric option cannot be used with a shear stress unload 
curve.  If a load curve is omitted, the stress is c alculated from the appropriate 
constant modulus, EA,  EB,  or  GAB. 
7.  Yield Behavior.   When formulations 4, 14, -14, and 24 (see FORM) a re used 
with loading and unloading curves the initial yield  strain is set equal to the 
strain of the ﬁrst point in the load curve having a  stress greater than zero.  
When the current strain exceeds the yield strain, t he stress follows the load 
curve and the yield strain is updated to the curren t strain.  When unloading 
occurs, the unload/reload curve is shifted along th e |u1D46J-axis until it intersects the 
load curve at the current yield strain and then the  stress is calculated from the 
shifted curve.  When using unloading curves, compre ssive stress elimination 
should be active to prevent the ﬁbers from developi ng compressive stress dur- 
ing unloading when the strain remains tensile.  To use this option, the unload 
curve should have a nonnegative second derivate so that the curve will shift right as the 
yield stress increases.  In fact, if a shift to the  left would be needed, the unload curves is 
not used and unloading will follow the load curve i nstead. 
If LCUA, LCUB, or LCUAB are input with negative cur ve ID values, then un- 
loading is handled diﬀerently.  Instead of shifting  the unload curve along the 
|u1D46J-axis, the curve is stretched in both the |u1D46J-direction and |u1D466-direction such that 
the ﬁrst point remains anchored at (0,0)  and the initial intersection point of the 
curves is moved to the current yield point.  This o ption guarantees the stress 
remains tensile while the strain is tensile, so com pressive stress elimination is 
not necessary.  To use this option the unload curve should have an initial slope less 
steep than the load curve and should steepen such t hat it intersects the load curve at 
some positive strain value.  *MAT_FABRIC  *MAT_034

When switching fabric forms or versions, the curve scale factors SFA and SFO 
on *DEFINE_CURVE can be used to oﬀset this behavior . 
9.  Per Material Venting Option.   The FVOPT ﬂag allows an airbag fabric venting 
equation to be assigned to a material.  The anticip ated use for this option is to 
allow a vent to be deﬁned using FVOPT = 1 or 2 for one material and fabric 
leakage to be deﬁned for using FVOPT = 3, 4, 5, or 6 for other materials.  In 
order to use FVOPT, a venting option must ﬁrst be d eﬁned for the airbag using 
the OPT parameter on *AIRBAG_WANG_NEFSKE or *AIRBAG _HYBRID.  If 
OPT = 0, then FVOPT is ignored.  If OPT is deﬁned a nd FVOPT is omitted, 
then FVOPT is set equal to OPT. 
10.  TSRFAC Option to Restore Element Strains.   Airbags that use a reference 
geometry will typically have nonzero strains at the  start of the calculation.  To 
prevent such initial strains from prematurely openi ng an airbag, initial strains 
are stored and subtracted from the measured strain throughout the calculation. 
/u1D̅48= |u1D4J3 (/u1D̅:A−/u1D̅:A|iCst|nCst|iCst|tCst|iCst|aCst /l.st) 
• Fabric formulations 2, 3, and 4 (see FORM) subtra ct oﬀ only the initial ten- 
sile strains so these forms are typically used with  CSE = 1 and LNRC = 1. 
• Fabric formulations 12, 13, 14, -14, and 24 subtr act oﬀ the total initial 
strains, so these forms may be used with CSE = 0 or  1 and LNRC = 0 or 1.  
A side eﬀect of this strain modiﬁcation is that air bags may not achieve the 
correct volume when they open.  Therefore, the TSRF AC option is imple- *MAT_034  *MAT_FABRIC  
2-318 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 mented to reduce the stored initial strain values o ver time thereby restor- 
ing the total stain which drives the airbag towards  the correct volume. 
During each cycle, the stored initial strains are s caled by (1.0 − TSRFAC) .  A 
small value on the order of 0.0001 is typically suﬃ cient to restore the strains in 
a few milliseconds of simulation time. 
/u1D̅48= |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv2/u1D̅:A−/u1D̅:A|aCst /d.st/∗.st/u.st |sCst|tCst|mCst|eCst|nCst|tCst |parenriµhtCv2 
The adjustment to restore initial strain is then, 
/u1D6C6ad justment =εinitial /product.v1[1 − TSFRAC]
|u1D4J6Cst. 
a)  Time Dependent TSRFAC.   When TSRFAC ˂ 0, |TSRFAC|  becomes the ID of 
a curve that deﬁnes TSRFAC as a function of time.  To delay the eﬀect of 
TSRFAC, the curve ordinate value should be initiall y zero and should 
ramp up to a small number to restore the strain at an appropriate time 
during the simulation.  The adjustment to restore i nitial strain is then, 
/u1D6C6ad justment (|u1D461|u1D4J6Cst) =εinitial /product.v1[1 − TSFRAC(|u1D461|u1D4J6Cst)]
|u1D4J6Cst. 
To prevent airbags from opening prematurely, it is recommended to use 
the load curve option of TSRFAC to delay the strain  restoration until the 
airbag is partially opened due to pressure loading.  
b)  Alternate Time Dependent TSRFAC.  For fabric formulations 2 and higher, a 
second curve option is invoked by setting TSRFAC ≥ 1 where TSRFAC is 
again the ID of a curve that deﬁnes TSRFAC as a fun ction of time.  Like 
the ﬁrst curve option, the stored initial strain va lues are scaled by 
(1.0 − TSRFAC) , but the modiﬁed initial strains are not saved, so  the eﬀect 
of TSRFAC does not accumulate.  In this case the ad justment to eliminate 
initial strain  
/u1D6C6ad justment (|u1D461|u1D4J6Cst) = [1 − TSFRAC(|u1D461|u1D4J6Cst)]/u1D6C6initial . 
Therefore, the curve should ramp up from zero to on e to fully restore the 
strain.  This option gives the user better control of the rate of restoring the 
strain as it is a function of time rather than solu tion time step. 
11.  Enhancements to the Material Formulations.   Material formulations (see 
FORM) 12, 13, and 14 are enhanced versions of formu lations 2, 3, and 4, respec- 
tively.  The most notable diﬀerence in their behavi or is apparent when a refer- 
ence geometry is used for the fabric.  As discussed  in Remark 10 , the strain is 
modiﬁed to prevent initial strains from prematurely  opening an airbag at the 
start of a calculation. 
Formulations 2, 3, and 4 subtract the initial tensi le strains, while the enhanced 
formulations subtract the total initial strains.  T herefore, the enhanced formula- *MAT_FABRIC  *MAT_034  
LS-DYNA R13 2-319 (MAT) tions can be used without setting CSE = 1 and LNRC = 1 since compressive 
stress cutoﬀ is not needed to prevent initial airba g movement.  Formulations 2, 
3, and 4 need compressive stress cutoﬀ when used wi th a reference geometry 
or they can generate compressive stress at the star t of a calculation.  Available 
for formulation 12 only, the ISREFG parameter activ ates an option to calculate 
the initial stress by using a reference geometry. 
Material formulation 24 is an enhanced version of f ormulation 14 implement- 
ing a correction for Poisson’s eﬀects when stress a s a function of strain curves 
are input for the |u1D44∆-ﬁber or |u1D44F-ﬁber.  Also, for formulation 24, the outputted 
stress and strain in the elout  or d3plot  database ﬁles is engineering stress and 
strain rather than the 2 nd  Piola Kirchoﬀ and Green’s strain used by formula- 
tions other than 0 and 1. 
12.  Noise Reduction for the Strain Rate Measure.   If tables are used, then the 
strain rate measure is the time derivative of the G reen-Lagrange strain in the 
direction of interest.  To suppress noise, the stra in rate is averaged according to 
the value of DT.  If DT > 0, it is recommended to u se a large enough value to 
suppress the noise, while being small enough to not  lose important infor- 
mation in the signal. 
13.  Hysteresis.   The hysteresis parameter /u1D4:B deﬁnes the fraction of dissipated 
energy during a load cycle in terms of the maximum possible dissipated ener- 
gy.  Referring to the Figure M34-1 , Figure M34-1.  A1 A2

model coating of the fabric using a sheet of elasti c-ideal-plastic material where 
the Young’s modulus, yield stress and thickness is speciﬁed for the coat mate- 
rial.  This will add rotational resistance to the f abric for a more realistic behav- 
ior of coated fabrics.  To read these properties se t FORM = -14, which adds an 
extra card containing the three ﬁelds ECOAT, SCOAT and TCOAT, corre- 
sponding to the three coat material properties ment ioned above. 
The thickness, TCOAT, applies to both sides of the fabric.  The coat material for 
a certain fabric element deforms along with this an d all elements connected to 
this element, which is how the rotations are “captu red.”  Note that unless 
TCOAT is set to a negative value, the coating will add to the membrane stiﬀ- 
ness.  For negative values of TCOAT the thickness i s set to |TCOAT|  and the 
membrane contribution from the coating is suppresse d.  For this feature to 
work, the fabric parts must not include any T-inter sections, and all of the sur- 
face normal vectors of connected fabric elements mu st point in the same direc- 
tion.  This option increases the computational comp lexity of this material. 
15.  Poisson’s Ratios.  Fabric forms 12, 13, 14, -14, and 24 allow input of  both the 
minor Poisson’s ratio, /u1D̅08|u1D44FCst|u1D44∆Cst , and the major Poisson’s ratio, /u1D̅08|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst . This allows 
asymmetric Poisson’s behavior to be modelled.  If t he major Poisson’s ratio is 
left blank or input as zero, then it will be calcul ated using /u1D̅08|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst =/u1D̅08|u1D44FCst|u1D44∆Cst |u1D438Cst|u1D44∆Csts
|u1D438Cst|u1D44FCsts. 
16.  St.  Venant-Wantzel Leakage.  If a negative value for the fabric venting 
option FVOPT is used (only -1 and -2 are supported) , the mass ﬂux through a 
fabric membrane is calculated according St.Venant-W antzel by 
|u1D4JȦ= |u1D434|eCst /f.st/f.st/u1D6F∫/radical.v12|u1D4JD|u1D4J6Cst|u1D7≠+|u1D4J6Cst 
where |u1D4JD|u1D4J6Cst describes the internal pressure, |u1D7≠+|u1D4J6Cst is the density of the outlet gas, and 
the eﬄuence function /u1D̅1: depends on the character of the ﬂow, the adiabatic  
exponent /u1D̅05 and the pressure diﬀerence between the inside ( |u1D4JD|u1D4J6Cst) and the outside 
(|u1D4JD|u1D44∆Cst) of the membrane.  For subsonic ﬂow it is formulat ed as:  
/u1D6F∫=/radical.v6/u1D̅05
/u1D̅05− 1|<racketleftCv6|parenleftCvJ|u1D4JD|u1D44∆Cst

|u1D4JD|u1D4J6Cst|parenriµhtCvJ/u1D̅05.sts+|oneCsts
/u1D̅05.sts
|<racketriµhtCv6 
and for sonic or critical ﬂow as:

FVOPT = -1 and -2, FLC is active and can be either a scalar or a curve deﬁning 
the porous leakage ﬂow coeﬃcient as a function of t ime.  The FAC coeﬃcient, 
however, is inactive  as the porous leakage velocity is computed using t he for- 
mula speciﬁed in Remark 16  from the coeﬃcient deﬁned in Card 4.  Note that

Remarks: 
1.  Material Model.   This material model invokes a special membrane el ement 
formulation regardless of the element choice.  It i s an anisotropic hyperelastic 
model where the 2 nd  Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress  /u1D412 is a function of the Green-
Lagrange strain /u1D404 and possibly its history.  Due to anisotropy, this  strain is 
transformed to obtain the strains in each of the ﬁb er directions, |u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st  and |u1D438/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st , 
together with the shear strain, |u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st . The associated stress components in the 
local system are given as functions of the strain c omponents 
|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st =γ|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st (|u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D438/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st )ϑ
|u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st =γ|u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D438/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st , |u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st )ϑ
|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st =γ|u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D438/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st )ϑ 
The factor |u1D6F∆ is used for dissipative eﬀects and is described in  more detail in 
Remark 4 .  For TH = 0, |u1D6F∆ = 1 .  The function ϑ represents a strain rate scale fac- 
tor (see Remark 6 ); for FXX = FYY = 0 this factor is 1. While the sh ear relation is 
given directly in the input through the curve SXY, the tabular input of the ﬁber 
stress components PXX and PYY is for the sake of co nvenience.  PXX and PYY 
give the engineering stress as function of engineer ing strain, that is, 
|u1D443/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st = |u1D443/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st (|u1D4J2/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st )
|u1D443/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st = |u1D443/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st ) 
Because of this, the following conversion formulae are used between stresses 
and strains 
|u1D4J2 =/radical.v11 + 2|u1D438 − 1
|u1D446 =|u1D443
1 + |u1D4J2 
which are applied in each of the two ﬁber direction s. 
2.  Compressive Stress Elimination.   Compressive stress elimination is optional 
through the CSE parameter, and when activated the p rincipal components of 
the 2 nd  Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress is restricted to positive va lues.  
3.  Reference Geometry and Smooth Stress Initialization .  If a reference 
geometry is used, then SRFAC is the curve ID for a function |u1D6F+(|u1D461) that should 
increase from zero to unity during a short time spa n.  During this time span, *MAT_034M  *MAT_FABRIC_MAP  
2-334 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 the Green-Lagrange strain used in the formulae in Remark 1  above is substitut- 
ed with  
/u1D404̃=/u1D404− [1 − |u1D6F+(|u1D461)]/u1D404|zeroCst, 
where /u1D404|zeroCst is the strain at time zero.  This is done in order  to smoothly initialize 
the stress resulting from using a reference geometr y diﬀerent from the geome- 
try at time zero. 
4.  Dissipative Effects.   The factor |u1D6F∆ is a function of the strain history and is 
initially set to unity.  It depends, more speciﬁcal ly, on the internal work /u1D̅16 given 
by the stress power 
/u1D̅16̇=/u1D412∶/u1D404̇. 
The evolution of |u1D6F∆ is related to the stress power since it will incre ase on load- 
ing and decrease on unloading, and as a result it i ntroduces dissipation.  The 
exact mathematical formula is too complicated to re veal, but basically the func- 
tion looks like 
|u1D6F∆ =/˙raceleft.v61 −/u1D4:B(|u1D4J2̅/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st ) +/u1D4:B(|u1D4J2̅/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st )exp|<racketleftCv1|u1D6FD(/u1D̅16−/u1D̅16)|<racketriµhtCv1/u1D̅16̇< 0
1 −/u1D4:B(|u1D4J2̅/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st )exp|<racketleftCv1−|u1D6FD(/u1D̅16−/u1D̅16)|<racketriµhtCv1/u1D̅16̇≥ 0 
Here /u1D̅16 is the maximum attained internal work up to this p oint in time, |u1D4J2̅/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st  and 
|u1D4J2̅/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st  are the engineering strain values associated with value. /u1D4:B(|u1D4J2̅/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st , |u1D4J2/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st ) is the 
hysteresis factor deﬁned by the user through the in put parameter TH; it may or 
may not depend on the strains. |u1D6FD is a decay constant that depends on |u1D4J2̅/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st  and 
|u1D4J2̅/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st , and /u1D̅16 is the minimum attained internal work at any point  in time after /u1D̅16 
was attained.  In other words, on unloading |u1D6F∆ will exponentially decay to 1 −
/u1D4:B, and on loading it will exponentially grow to 1 an d always be restricted by 
the lower and upper bounds, 1 −/u1D4:B< |u1D6F∆ ≤ 1 . The only thing the user needs to 
care about is to input a proper hysteresis factor /u1D4:B, and with reference to a gen- 
eral loading/unloading cycle illustrated in Figure M34M-1  the relation 1 −/u1D4:B=
/u1D̅16|u1D462Cst//u1D̅16|u1D4J9Cst should hold. 
5.  Packing of Yarn in Compression.   To account for the packing of yarns in 
compression, a compaction eﬀect is modeled by addin g a term to the strain 
energy function of the form  Figure M34M-1.   Cyclic loading model for hysteresis model H *MAT_FABRIC_MAP  *MAT_034M  
LS-DYNA R13 2-335 (MAT) /u1D44A|u1D4J≠Cst= |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cst/u1D4:D|<raceleftCvJln |parenleftCvJ/u1D4:D
/u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst|parenriµhtCvJ − 1|<raceriµhtCvJ ,  for /u1D4:D≤/u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst  . 
Here |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cst (BULKC) is a physical bulk modulus, /u1D4:D= det(/u1D405) is the jacobian of the 
deformation and /u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst (JACC) is the critical jacobian for when the eﬀect  commenc- 
es. /u1D405 is the deformation gradient.  This contributes to the pressure with a term 
|u1D4JD = |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cstln |parenleftCvJ/u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst
/u1D4:D|parenriµhtCvJ ,  for /u1D4:D≤/u1D4:D|u1D4J≠Cst 
and thus prevents membrane elements from collapsing  or inverting when sub- 
jected to compressive loads.  The bulk modulus |u1D43∆|u1D4J≠Cst should be selected with the 
slopes in the stress map tables in mind, presumably  some order of magni- 
tude(s) smaller.   
6.  Strain Rate Scale Factor.   As an option, the local membrane stress can be 
scaled based on the engineering strain rates via th e function /u1D̅1̅=/u1D̅1̅(|u1D4J2̇,/u1D412). We set 
|u1D4J2̇= max |parenleftCvJ/u1D̅16̇
‖/u1D405/u1D412‖, 0|parenriµhtCvJ 
to be the equivalent engineering strain rate in the  direction of loading and de- 
ﬁne 
/u1D̅1̅(|u1D4J2̇,/u1D4̅A) =|u1D439/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st (|u1D4J2̇)||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st | + |u1D439/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st (|u1D4J2̇)||u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st | + 2||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st |
||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44B.st | + ||u1D446/u1D44C.st/u1D44C.st | + 2||u1D446/u1D44B.st/u1D44C.st |, 
meaning that the strain rate scale factor defaults to the user input data FXX and 
FYY for uniaxial loading in the two material direct ions, respectively.  Note that 
we only consider strain rate scaling in loading and  not in unloading, and fur- 
thermore that the strain rates used in evaluating t he curves are pre-ﬁltered 
using the time window DT to avoid excessive numeric al noise.  It is, therefore, 
recommended to set DT to a time corresponding to at  least hundred time steps 
or so. *MAT_035  *MAT_PLASTIC_GREEN-NAGHDI_RATE  
2-336 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 *MAT_PLASTIC_GREEN-NAGHDI_RATE  
This is  Material Type 35.  This model is available only for  brick elements and is similar 
to model 3 but uses the Green-Naghdi Rate formulati on rather than the Jaumann rate 
for the stress update.  For some cases this might b e helpful.  This model also has a strain 
rate dependency following the Cowper-Symonds model.

Formulation: 
The eﬀective plastic strain used in this model is d eﬁned to be plastic work equivalent.  
A consequence of this is that for parameters deﬁned  as functions of eﬀective plastic 
strain, the rolling (00) direction should be used a s reference direction.  For instance, the 
hardening curve for HR = 3 is the stress as functio n of strain for uniaxial tension in the *MAT_3-PARAMETER_BARLAT  *MAT_036  
LS-DYNA R13 2-347 (MAT) rolling direction, VLCID curve should give the rela tive volume change as function of 
strain for uniaxial tension in the rolling directio n and load curve given by −E should 
give the Young’s modulus as function of strain for uniaxial tension in the rolling 
direction.  Optionally, the curve can be substitute d for a table deﬁning hardening as 
function of plastic strain rate (HR = 3), temperatu re (HR = 8), or pre-strain (HR = 10).  
 
Exceptions from the rule above are curves deﬁned as  functions of plastic strain in the 
45 ° and 90 ° directions, i.e.,  |u1D4431 and |u1D4432 for HR = 7 and negative R45  or R 90 , see Fleischer 
et.al.  [2007].  The hardening curves are here deﬁn ed as measured stress as function of 
measured plastic strain for uniaxial tension in the  direction of interest, i.e., as 
determined from experimental testing using a standa rd procedure.  The optional biaxial 
and shear hardening curves require some further ela boration, as we assume that a 
biaxial or shear test reveals that the true stress tensor in the material system expressed 
as 
 
/u1D̅48= |parenleftCv4|u1D7≠∆ 0
0±|u1D7≠∆|parenriµhtCv4 , |u1D7≠∆ ≥ 0, 
is a function of the (plastic) strain tensor 
/u1D̅:A= |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠|oneCst 0
0±|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|parenriµhtCvJ , |u1D7≠≠|oneCst≥ 0, |u1D7≠≠|twoCst≥ 0, 
The input hardening curves are |u1D7≠∆ as function of |u1D7≠≠|oneCst+|u1D7≠≠|twoCst. The ± sign above distinguishes 
between the biaxial ( +) and the shear ( −) cases.  Moreover, the curves deﬁning the |u1D44J-
values are as function of the measured plastic stra in for uniaxial tension in the direction 
of interest.  These curves are transformed internal ly to be used with the eﬀective stress 
and strain properties in the actual model.  The eﬀe ctive plastic strain does not coincide 
with the plastic strain components in other directi ons than the rolling direction and may 
be somewhat confusing to the user.  Therefore the v on Mises work equivalent plastic 
strain is output as history variable #2 if HR = 7 o r if any of the R-values is deﬁned as 
function of the plastic strain. 
 
The |u1D44J-values in curves are deﬁned as the ratio of instan taneous width change to 
instantaneous thickness change.  That is, assume th at the width /u1D44A and thickness |u1D447 are 
measured as function of strain.  Then the correspon ding |u1D44J-values is given by: 
|u1D44J =|u1D4J1 /u1D44A 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ //u1D44A
|u1D4J1|u1D447

The anisotropic yield criterion Φ for plane stress is deﬁned as:

The anisotropy parameter |u1D4JD is calculated implicitly.  According to Barlat and  Lian the |u1D44J-
value, width to thickness strain ratio, for any ang le /u1D̅1∫ can be calculated from: 
|u1D44J/u1D̅1∫.st=2|u1D4JA|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st|u1D4JACst

where |u1D7≠∆/u1D̅1∫.st is the uniaxial tension in the /u1D̅1∫ direction.  This expression can be used to 
iteratively calculate the value of |u1D4JD.  Let /u1D̅1∫= 45  and deﬁne a function |u1D4J4 as: 
|u1D4J4|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1 =2|u1D4JA|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st|u1D4JACst

An iterative search is used to ﬁnd the value of |u1D4JD.  If PB > 0, material parameters |u1D44∆(AB), 
/u1D450(CB), ℎ(HB), and |u1D4JD(PB) are used directly.

SIGY is set to zero, the strain to yield if found b y solving for the intersection of the 
linearly elastic loading equation with the strain h ardening equation: 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D438|u1D7≠≠ 
|u1D7≠∆ =/u1D458|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JBCst 
which gives the elastic strain at yield as:

The other available hardening models include the Vo ce equation given by:

the Gosh equation given by: 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst) =/u1D458(|u1D7≠≠|zeroCst+ |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst)|u1D4JBCst− |u1D4JD, 
and ﬁnally the Hocket-Sherby equation given by: 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst |u1D4JDCsts/u1D45B.sts
. 
For the Gosh hardening law, the interpretation of t he variable SPI is the same, i.e., if set 
to zero the strain at yield is determined implicitl y from the intersection of the strain 
hardening equation with the linear elastic equation . 
 
To include strain rate eﬀects in the model we multi ply the yield stress by a factor 
depending on the eﬀective plastic strain rate.  We use the Cowper-Symonds’ model; 
hence the yield stress can be written as: 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D7≠∆/Y.st|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst)

|u1D436|parenriµhtCv6|oneCst/|u1D4JDCst
⎭|<raceriµhtCex⎬|<raceriµhtCex⎫
 
where |u1D7≠∆/Y.st|u1D46≠Cst denotes the static yield stress, |u1D436 and |u1D4JD are material parameters, and |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst is the 
eﬀective plastic strain rate.  With HR.EQ.3 strain rate eﬀects can be deﬁned using a 
table, in which each load curve in the table deﬁnes  the yield stress as function of plastic 
strain for a given strain rate.  In contrast to mat erial 24, when the strain rate is larger 
than that of any curve in the table, the table is e xtrapolated in the strain rate direction to 
ﬁnd the appropriate yield stress.  
 
A kinematic hardening model is implemented followin g the works of Chaboche and 
Roussilier.  A back stress /u1D̅:6 is introduced such that the eﬀective stress is com puted as: 
|u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st= |u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst − 2|u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst , |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst − 2|u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst , |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|twoCst ) *MAT_036  *MAT_3-PARAMETER_BARLAT  
2-350 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 The back stress is the sum of up to four terms acco rding to: 
|u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J8Cst|fourCst
|u1D4J8Cst=|oneCst 
and the evolution of each back stress component is as follows: 
|u1D6FF|u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J8Cst= |u1D436|u1D4J8Cst|parenleftCvJ|u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst

in order to get the expected stress strain response  for uniaxial stress.  The calculated 
eﬀective stress is stored in history variable #7. 
 
With hardening rule HR = 10, the ﬂow curves in a ta ble deﬁnition can be based on 
diﬀerent pre-strain values.  Hence ﬂow curves can h ave varying shapes as deﬁned in 
the corresponding table.  For example, the plastic strain distribution as obtained in a 
ﬁrst step of a two-stage procedure is initialized i n the next stage with *INITIAL_-
STRESS_SHELL and corresponding values for EPS. With  HR = 10 this pre-strain is 
initially transferred to history variable #9 and al l stresses and other history variables are 
set to zero assuming that the part was subjected to  an annealing phase.  With EPS now 
stored on history variable #9 the table lookup for the actual yield value may now be 
used to interpolate on diﬀerently shaped ﬂow curves .  
A failure criterion for nonlinear strain paths (NLP ) in sheet metal forming: 
When the option NLP is used, a necking failure crit erion is activated to account for the 
non-linear strain path eﬀect in sheet metal forming .  Based on the traditional Forming 
Limit Diagram (FLD) for the linear strain path, the  Formability Index (F.I.) is calculated 
for every element in the model throughout the simul ation duration.  The entire F.I. time 
history for every element is stored in history vari able #1 in d3plot  ﬁles, accessible from 
Post/History  menu in LS-PrePost  v4.0.  In addition to the F.I. output, other usefu l 
information stored in other history variables can b e found as follows, 
1.  Formability Index: #1 
2.  Strain ratio (in-plane minor strain increment/majo r strain increment): #2 
3.  Eﬀective strain from the planar isotropic assumptio n : #3 
 *MAT_3-PARAMETER_BARLAT  *MAT_036  
LS-DYNA R13 2-351 (MAT) To enable the output of these history variables to the d3plot  ﬁles, NEIPS on the *DATA-
BASE_EXTENT_BINARY card must be set to at least 3.  The history variables can also 
be plotted on the formed sheet blank as a color con tour map, accessible from 
Post/FriComp/Misc  menu.  The index value starts from 0.0, with the o nset of necking 
failure when it reaches 1.0.  The F.I. is calculate d based on critical eﬀect strain method, 
as explained in manual pages in *MAT_037.  The theo retical background based on two 
papers can also be found in manual pages in *MAT_03 7. 
 
When d3plot  ﬁles are used to plot the history variable #1 (the  F.I.) in color contour, the 
value in the Max  pull-down menu in Post/FriComp  needs to be set to Min , meaning that 
the necking failure occurs only when all integratio n points through the thickness have 
reached the critical value of 1.0 (refer to Tharrett and Stoughton’s paper in 2003 SAE 2003-
01-1157 ).  It is also suggested to set the variable “MAXIN T” in *DATA-
BASE_EXTENT_BINARY to the same value as the variabl e “NIP” in *SEC-
TION_SHELL.  In addition, the value in the Avg  pull-down menu in Post/FriRang  needs 
to be set to None .  The strain path history (major vs.  minor strain ) of each element can 
be plotted with the radial dial button Strain Path  in Post/FLD . 
 
An example of a partial input for the material is p rovided below, where the FLD for the 
linear strain path is deﬁned by the variable NLP wi th load curve ID 211, where 
abscissas represent minor strains and ordinates rep resent major strains.

Shown in Figures M36-1 , M36-2  and M36-3 , predictions and validations of forming limit 
curves (FLC) of various nonlinear strain paths on a  single shell element was done using 
this new option, for an Aluminum alloy with |u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst = 0.8, |u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst = 0.6 |u1D44∆|u1D4JB|u1D4J1 |u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst = 0.55  and the 
yield at 130.0 MPa.  In each case, the element is f urther strained in three diﬀerent paths 
(uniaxial stress – U.A., plane strain – P.S., and e qui-biaxial strain – E.B.) separately, 
following a pre-straining in uniaxial, plane strain  and equi-biaxial strain state, 
respectively.  The forming limits are determined at  the end of the secondary straining 
for each path, when the F.I. has reached the value of 1.0.  It is seen that the predicted 
FLCs (dashed curves) in case of the nonlinear strai n paths are totally diﬀerent from the 
FLCs under the linear strain paths.  It is noted th at the current predicted FLCs under 
nonlinear strain path are obtained by connecting th e ends of the three distinctive strain 
paths.  More detailed FLCs can be obtained by strai ning the elements in more paths 
between U.A. and P.S. and between P.S. and E.B.  In  Figure M36-4 , time-history plots of 
F.I., strain ratio and eﬀective strain are shown fo r uniaxial pre-strain followed by equi-
biaxial strain path on the same single element. 
 
Typically, to assess sheet formability, F.I. contou r of the entire part should be plotted.  
Based on the contour plot, non-linear strain path a nd the F.I. time history of a few 
elements in the area of concern can be plotted for further study.  These plots are similar 
to those shown in manual pages of *MAT_037. 
Smoothing of the strain ratio /u1D̅:̅: 
*CONTROL_FORMING_STRAIN_RATIO_SMOOTH applies a smoo thing algorithm to 
reduce output noise level of the strain ratio |u1D6FD (in-plane minor strain increment/major 
strain increment) which is used to calculate the Fo rmability Index. 
Support of non-integer ﬂow potential exponent /u1D48E: 
Starting in Dev139482, non-integer value of the exp onent |u1D4JA is supported for the option 
NLP. 
Heat treatment with variable HTFLAG: 
Heat treatment for increasing the formability of pr estrained aluminum sheets can be 
simulated through the use of HTFLAG, where the inte ntion is to run a forming 
simulation in steps involving preforming, springbac k, heat treatment and postforming.  
In each step the history is transferred to the next  via the use of dynain (see *INTER-
FACE_SPRINGBACK).  The ﬁrst two steps are performed  with HTFLAG = 0 according 
to standard procedures, resulting in a plastic stra in ﬁeld |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCstcorresponding to the 
prestrain.  The heat treatment step is performed us ing HTFLAG = 1 in a coupled *MAT_3-PARAMETER_BARLAT  *MAT_036  
LS-DYNA R13 2-353 (MAT) thermomechanical simulation, where the blank is hea ted.  The coupling between 
thermal and mechanical is only that the maximum tem perature |u1D447|zeroCst is stored as a history 
variable in the material model, this corresponding to the heat treatment temperature.  
Here it is important to export all history variable s to the dynein ﬁle for the postforming 
step.  In the ﬁnal postforming step, HTFLAG = 2, th e yield stress is then augmented by 
the Hocket-Sherby like term: 
∆|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D44F − (|u1D44F − |u1D44∆)exp |<racketleftCv4− /u1D450|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst− |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv2/u1D451.st|<racketriµhtCv4 
where |u1D44∆, |u1D44F,/u1D450 |u1D44∆|u1D4JB|u1D4J1 |u1D4J1  are given as tables as functions of the heat treatm ent temperature |u1D447|zeroCst 
and prestrain |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst. That is, in the table deﬁnitions each load curve c orresponds to a given 
prestrain and the load curve value is with respect to the heat treatment temperature, 
|u1D44∆ = |u1D44∆(|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst)    |u1D44F = |u1D44F(|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst)    /u1D450=/u1D450(|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst)    |u1D4J1 = |u1D4J1(|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst)     
The eﬀect of heat treatment is that the material st rength decreases but hardening 
increases, thus typically: 
|u1D44∆ ≤ 0    |u1D44F ≥ |u1D44∆    /u1D450> 0    |u1D4J1 > 0

LS-DYNA R13 2-361 (MAT) Formulation: 
The standard 3-parameter Barlat model incorporates plastic anisotropy in a fairly 
moderate sense, allowing for the speciﬁcation of R- values in three diﬀerent directions, 
together with a stress level in the reference direc tion (termed rolling  or 0 degree  
direction), but not more than that.  To allow for a  more accurate representation of a 
more severe anisotropic material, like in rolled al uminium sheet components, one could 
migrate to the Barlat YLD2000 model (material 133 i n LS-DYNA) which also allows for 
specifying stress levels in the two remaining direc tions as well as stress and strain data 
at an arbitrary point on the yield surface.  The pr operties of extruded aluminium 
however, are such that neither of these two materia l models are suﬃcient to describe its 
extreme anisotropy.  One particular observation fro m experiments is that anisotropy 
evolves with deformation, a feature that is not cap tured in any of the material models 
discussed so far.  The present extended version of material 36 was therefore developed 
in an attempt to ﬁll this void in the LS-DYNA mater ial library.  In short, this material 
allows for R-values and stress levels in the three directions, together with similar data in 
biaxial and shear directions. And , these properties are functions of the eﬀective pl astic 
strain so as to allow for deformation induced aniso tropy.  The following is an 
explanation of its parameters. 
 
The hardening curves or tables LCH00, LCH45 and LCH 90 are here deﬁned as 
measured stress as function of measured plastic str ain (and potentially rate) for uniaxial 
tension in the direction of interest, i.e., as dete rmined from experimental testing using a 
standard procedure.  The optional biaxial and shear  hardening curves LCHBI and 
LCHSH require some further elaboration, as we assum e that a biaxial or shear test 
reveals that the true stress tensor in the material  system expressed as 
/u1D̅48= |parenleftCv4|u1D7≠∆ 0
0±|u1D7≠∆|parenriµhtCv4 , |u1D7≠∆ ≥ 0, 
is a function of the (plastic) strain tensor 
/u1D̅:A= |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠|oneCst 0
0±|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|parenriµhtCvJ , |u1D7≠≠|oneCst≥ 0, |u1D7≠≠|twoCst≥ 0, 
The input hardening curves are |u1D7≠∆ as function of |u1D7≠≠|oneCst+|u1D7≠≠|twoCst. The ± sign above distinguishes 
between the biaxial ( +) and the shear ( −) cases. 
 
Moreover, the curves LCR00, LCR45 and LCR90 deﬁning  the R values are as function of 
the measured plastic strain for uniaxial tension in  the direction of interest.  The R-values 
in themselves are deﬁned as the ratio of instantane ous width change to instantaneous 
thickness change.  That is, assume that the width W  and thickness T are measured as 
function of strain.  Then the corresponding R-value  is given by: 
|u1D44J/u1D̅11.st=|u1D4J1 /u1D44A 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ //u1D44A
|u1D4J1|u1D447 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ /|u1D447. *MAT_036E  *MAT_EXTENDED_3-PARAMETER_BARLAT  
2-362 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 These curves are transformed internally to be used with the eﬀective stress and strain 
properties in the actual model.  The eﬀective plast ic strain does not coincide with the 
plastic strain components in other directions than the rolling direction and may be 
somewhat confusing to the user.  Therefore the von Mises work equivalent plastic strain 
is output as history variable #2. As for hardening,  the optional biaxial and shear R-value 
curves LCRBI and LCRSH are deﬁned in a special way for which we return to the local 
plastic strain tensor /u1D̅:A as deﬁned above.  The biaxial and shear R-values a re deﬁned as 
|u1D44J|u1D44FCst/|u1D46≠Cst=|u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst
|u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst 
and again the curves are |u1D44J|u1D44FCst/|u1D46≠Cst as function of |u1D7≠≠|oneCst+|u1D7≠≠|twoCst. Note here that the suﬃx |u1D44F assumes 
loading biaxially and |u1D46≠ assumes loading in shear, so the R-values to be de ﬁned are 
always positive. 
 
The option HOSF = 0 is equivalent to the standard B arlat model with HR = 7 whose 
yield function can be expressed by the potential Φ as given in the remarks for *MAT_3-
PARAMETER_BARLAT. The HOSF = 1 allows for a “Hosfor d-based” eﬀective stress in 
the yield function instead of using the Barlat-base d eﬀective stress. If the material and 
principal axes are coincident, the plastic potentia l Φ for HOSF = 1 can be written as 
 
Φ(|u1D7≠∆) =1
2|parenleftCv1||u1D7≠∆|oneCst||u1D4JACst+ ||u1D7≠∆|twoCst||u1D4JACst+ ||u1D7≠∆|oneCst− |u1D7≠∆|twoCst||u1D4JACst|parenriµhtCv1 − |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D4JACst 
  
The main diﬀerence is that the Barlat-based eﬀectiv e stress contains the orthotropic 
parameters |u1D44∆,/u1D450,ℎ and |u1D4JD in the yield function meanwhile the Hosford-based eﬀective 
stress does not contain any information about the a nisotropy.  For HOSF = 1, the 
information about direction dependent yielding is d irectly obtained from the hardening 
curves LCH00, LCH45 and LCH90. For materials exhibi ting very dissimilar |u1D44J −values 
in the diﬀerent material directions (e.g. typical a luminum extrusion), HOSF = 0 might 
(but does not necessarily) lead to concave yield su rfaces which, in turn, might lead to 
numerical instabilities under certain circumstances .  HOSF = 1 tends to reduce this 
eﬀect. 
 
More information on the theoretical and numerical f oundations of HOSF = 1 can be 
found on the paper by Andrade, Borrvall, DuBois and  Feucht, A Hosford-based 
orthotropic plasticity model in LS-DYNA  (2019). *MAT_TRANSVERSELY_ANISOTROPIC_ELASTIC_PLASTIC  *MAT_037

This is  Material Type 37.  This model is for simulating she et forming processes with 
anisotropic material.  Only transverse anisotropy c an be considered.  Optionally an 
arbitrary dependency of stress and eﬀective plastic  strain can be deﬁned with a load 
curve.  This plasticity model is fully iterative an d is available only for shell elements.   
Available options include: 
<BLANK> 
ECHANGE 
NLP_FAILURE 
NLP2 
The ECHANGE option allows the Young’s Modulus to ch ange during the simulation: 
 
The NLP_FAILURE option estimates failure using the Formability Index (F.I.) which 
accounts for the non-linear strain paths common in metal forming application (see 
Remarks 5  and 7).  The option NLP is also available for *MAT_036, *MAT_125 and 
*MAT_226.  A related keyword is *CONTROL_FORMING_ST RAIN_RATIO_SMOOTH, 
which applies a smoothing algorithm to reduce outpu t noise level of the strain ratio |u1D6FD 
(in-plane minor strain increment/major strain incre ment) when calculating F.I. 
 
The NLP_FAILURE option uses eﬀective plastic strain  to calculate the onset of necking, 
which assumes the necking happens in an instant.  H owever, necking may occur over a 
longer duration which the option NLP2 is developed to address.  NLP2 calculates the 
damage during forming and accumulates it to predict  the sheet metal failure.

Remarks: 
1.  Formulation.   Consider Cartesian reference axes which are paral lel to the three 
symmetry planes of anisotropic behavior.  Then, the  yield function suggested 
by Hill [1948] can be written as: 
|u1D439(|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst )|twoCst+ |u1D43A(|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst − |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst )|twoCst+/u1D4:B(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst )|twoCst+ 2/u1D4:F|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|threeCst |twoCst+ 2|u1D44≠|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|oneCst |twoCst+ 2/u1D441|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst |twoCst− 1

where |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst, and |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst are the tensile yield stresses and |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|oneCst|twoCst , |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst|threeCst , and |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst|oneCst  are 
the shear yield stresses.  The constants |u1D439, |u1D43A, /u1D4:B, /u1D4:F, |u1D44≠, and /u1D441 are related to the 
yield stress by:

The isotropic case of von Mises plasticity can be r ecovered by setting: 
|u1D439 = |u1D43A =/u1D4:B=1
2|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst 
and  
/u1D4:F= |u1D44≠ =/u1D441=3
2|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst 
For the particular case of transverse anisotropy, w here properties do not vary 
in the |u1D46J|oneCst− |u1D46J|twoCst plane, the following relations hold: 
2|u1D439 = 2|u1D43A =1

|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst−1
2|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst|twoCst 
where it has been assumed that |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|oneCst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst. 
Letting |u1D43∆ = |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|threeCst⁄ , the yield criteria can be written as: 
|u1D439(|u1D7≠∆) = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J2Cst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst  , 
where 
|u1D439(|u1D7≠∆)≡|<racketleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst |twoCst+ |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst |twoCst+ |u1D43∆|twoCst|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst |twoCst− |u1D43∆|twoCst|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst (|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst + |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst ) − |parenleftCv22 − |u1D43∆|twoCst|parenriµhtCv2|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst

  . 
The rate of plastic strain is assumed to be normal to the yield surface so |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JDCst is 
found from: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠6∂|u1D439
∂|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   . 
Now consider the case of plane stress, where σ|threeCst|threeCst = 0.  Also, deﬁne the anisot- 
ropy input parameter, |u1D44J, as the ratio of the in-plane plastic strain rate to the 
out-of-plane plastic strain rate, *MAT_TRANSVERSELY_ANISOTROPIC_ELASTIC_PLASTIC  *MAT_037  
LS-DYNA R13 2-367 (MAT) |u1D44J =|u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst|twoCst |u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4JDCst  . 
It then follows that 
|u1D44J =2
|u1D43∆|twoCst− 1  . 
Using the plane stress assumption and the deﬁnition  of |u1D44J, the yield function 
may now be written as: 
|u1D439(|u1D7≠∆) = |<racketleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst |twoCst+ |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst |twoCst−2|u1D44J
|u1D44J + 1|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst + 22|u1D44J + 1
|u1D44J + 1|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst |twoCst|<racketriµhtCvJ|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2
. 
2.  Anisotropic Parameter R.   When the |u1D44J value is set to a negative value, it 
stabilizes the sheet thickness or thinning in sheet metal forming for some high 
strength types of steel or in cases where the simul ation time is long.  In Figure 
M37-1 , a comparison of thinning contours is shown on a U -channel forming 
(one-half model) using negative and positive |u1D44J values.  Maximum thinning on 
the draw wall is slight higher in the negative |u1D44J case than that in the positive |u1D44J 
case. 
3.  Comparison to other Material Models.  There are several diﬀerences 
between this model and other plasticity models for shell elements such as the 
model, MAT_PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLASTICITY.  First, the  yield function for 
plane stress does not include the transverse shear stress components which are 
updated elastically, and, secondly, this model is a lways fully iterative.  Conse- 
quently, in comparing results for the isotropic cas e where |u1D44J = 1.0  with other Thinning %

usually insigniﬁcant. 
4.  ECHANGE.   The Young’s modulus has been assumed to be consta nt.  
However, some researchers have found that Young’s m odulus decreases with 
respect to the increase of eﬀective plastic strain.   To accommodate this new 
observation, a new option of ECHANGE is added.  The re are two methods 
deﬁning the change of Young’s modulus change: 
The ﬁrst method is to use a curve to deﬁne the scal e factor with respect to the 
eﬀective plastic strain.  The value of this scale f actor should decrease from 1.0 
to 0.0 with the increase of eﬀective plastic strain . 
The second method is to use a function as proposed by Yoshida [2003]: 
|u1D438 = |u1D438|zeroCst− |parenleftCv2|u1D438|zeroCst− |u1D438|u1D434Cst|parenriµhtCv2|<racketleftCv11 − exp(−/u1D̅01|u1D7≠≠)|<racketriµhtCv1. 
An example of the option ECHANGE is provided in the  Remarks section of the 
*MAT_125 manual pages. 
5.  Nonlinear Strain Paths.   When the keyword option NLP_FAILURE is used, a 
necking failure criterion independent of strain pat h changes is activated.  In 
sheet metal forming, as strain path history (plotte d on in-plane major and mi- 
nor strain space) of an element becomes non-linear,  the position and shape of a 
traditional strain-based Forming Limit Diagram (FLD ) changes.  This option 
provides a simple formability index (F.I.) which re mains invariant regardless 
of the presence of the non-linear strain paths in t he model and can be used to 
identify if the element has reached its necking lim it. Equivalent strain

LS-DYNA R13 2-369 (MAT) Formability index (F.I) is calculated, as illustrat ed in Figure M37-2 , for every 
element in the sheet blank throughout the simulatio n duration.  The value of 
F.I. is 0.0 for virgin material and reaches maximum  of 1.0 when the material 
fails.  The theoretical background can be found in two papers: 1) T.B. Stough- 
ton, X. Zhu, “Review of Theoretical Models of the S train-Based FLD and their Rele- 
vance to the Stress-Based FLD, International Journa l of Plasticity”, V. 20, Issues 8-9, 
P. 1463-1486, 2003; and 2) Danielle Zeng, Xinhai Zh u, Laurent B. Chappuis, Z.

Simulations”, 2008 SAE Proceedings, Detroit MI, Apr il, 2008 .  
6.  ICFLD.   The load curve input for ICFLD follows keyword fo rmat in *DEFINE_-
CURVE, with abscissas as minor strains and ordinate s as major strains. 
ICFLD can also be speciﬁed using the *DEFINE_CURVE_ FLC keyword where 
the sheet metal thickness and strain hardening valu e are used.  Detailed usage 
information can be found in the manual entry for *D EFINE_CURVE_FLC. 
7.  Formability Index Output.   The formability index is output as a history 
variable #1 in d 3plot  ﬁles.  In addition to the F.I. values, starting in  Revision 
95599, the strain ratio |u1D6FD and eﬀective plastic strain |u1D7≠≠̅ are written to the d 3plot  
database as history variables #2 and #3, respective ly provided NEIPS on the 
second ﬁeld of the ﬁrst card of *DATABASE_EXTENT_BI NARY is set to at 
least 3.  The contour map of history variables can be plotted in LS-PrePost, 
accessible in Post /FriComp , under Misc , and by Element , under Post/History .  It 
is suggested that variable MAXINT in *DATABASE_EXTE NT_BINARY be set 
to the same value of as the NIP ﬁeld for the *SECTI ON_SHELL keyword. 
8.  STRAINLT.   By setting the STRAINLT ﬁeld strains (and strain ratios) can be 
averaged to reduce noise, which, in turn, aﬀect the  calculation of the formabil- 
ity index.  The strain STRAINLT causes the formabil ity index calculation to use 
only time averaged strains.  Reasonable STRAINLT va lues range from 5 × 10 −|threeCst 
to 10 −|twoCst.*MAT_038  *MAT_BLATZ-KO_FOAM

This is  Material Type 40. This model allows the deﬁnition o f an orthotropic nonlinear 
elastic material based on a ﬁnite strain formulatio n with the initial geometry as the 
reference.  Failure is optional with two failure cr iteria available.  Optionally, stiﬀness 
proportional damping can be deﬁned.  In the stress initialization phase, temperatures 
can be varied to impose the initial stresses.  This  model is only available for shell and 
solid elements. 
WARNING : We do not recommend using this model at this 
time since it can be unstable especially if the 
stress-strain curves increase in stiﬀness with in- 
creasing strain.

Remarks: 
1.  The ATRACK Field.  The initial material directions are set using AOPT  and the 
related data.  By default, the material directions in shell elements are updated 
each cycle based on the rotation of the 1-2 edge, o r else the rotation of all edges 
if the invariant node numbering option is set on *C ONTROL_ACCURACY.  
When ATRACK=1, an optional scheme is used in which the |u1D44∆-direction of the 
material tracks element deformation as well as rota tion.  For more information, 
see Remark 2 of *MAT_COMPOSITE_DAMAGE. 
2.  Computing Stresses.  The stress versus stretch curves LCIDA, LCIDB, LCI DC, 
LCIDAB, LCIDBC, and LCIDCA are only used to obtain the slope (stiﬀness) to 
ﬁll up the |C| matrix and are not used directly to compute the st resses.  The 
stresses are computed using the |C| matrix and the Green-St Venant strain ten- 
sor. *MAT_USER_DEFINED_MATERIAL_MODELS  *MAT_041-050

Remarks: 
1.  Cohesive Elements.   Material models for the cohesive element (solid e lement 
type 19) uses the ﬁrst two material param eters to set ﬂags in the element formula- 
tion . 
a)  P1.   The P1 ﬁeld controls how the density is used to c alculate the mass 
when determining the tractions at mid-surface (trac tions are calculated on 
a surface midway between the surfaces deﬁned by nod es 1-2-3-4 and 5-6-
7-8).  If P1 is set to 1.0, then the density is per  unit area of the mid-surface 
instead of per unit volume.  Note that the cohesive  element formulation 
permits the element to have zero or negative volume . *MAT_USER_DEFINED_MATERIAL_MODELS  *MAT_041-050  
LS-DYNA R13 2-385 (MAT) b)  P2.   The second parameter, P2, speciﬁes the number of integration points 
(one to four) that are required to fail for the ele ment to fail.  If it is zero, 
the element will not fail regardless of IFAIL. The recommended value for 
P2 is 1. 
c)  Other Parameters.   The cohesive element only uses MID, RO, MT, LMC, 
NHV, IFAIL and IVECT in addition to the material pa rameters. 
d)  Appendix R.   See Appendix R for the speciﬁcs of the umat  subroutine re- 
quirements for the cohesive element. 
2.  Material Constants.   If IORTHO = 0, LMC must be ≤ 48.  If IORTHO = 1, LMC 
must be ≤ 40.  If more material constants are neede d, LMCA may be used to 
create an additional material constant array.  Ther e is no limit on the size of 
LMCA. 
3.  Spot weld thinning.   If the user-deﬁned material is used for beam or b rick 
element spot welds that are tied to shell elements,  and SPOTHIN > 0 on *CON-
TROL_CONTACT, then spot weld thinning will be done for those shells if IS-
POT = 2.  Otherwise, it will not be done.  
4.  Thick Shell Formulation 5.   IEVTS is optional and is used only by thick shell  
formulation 5.  It points to the position of |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst in the material constants array.  
Following |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst, the next 5 material constants must be |u1D438|u1D44FCst, |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst, /u1D̅08|u1D44FCst|u1D44∆Cst , /u1D̅08|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst , and /u1D̅08|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44FCst .  
This data enables thick shell formulation 5 to calc ulate an accurate thickness 
strain, otherwise the thickness strain will be base d on the elastic constants 
pointed to by IBULK and IG. *MAT_051  *MAT_BAMMAN

Remarks: 
The kinematics associated with the model are discus sed in references [Hill 1948, 
Bammann and Aifantis 1987, Bammann 1989].  The desc ription below is taken nearly 
verbatim from Bammann [1989]. 
 *MAT_BAMMAN  *MAT_051  
LS-DYNA R13 2-389 (MAT) With the assumption of linear elasticity, we can wr ite: 
/u1D6D4/u1D45C.st= |u1D7≠6 tr|parenleftCv1/u1D40:|u1D4J2Cst|parenriµhtCv1/u1D̅CF+ 2|u1D7≠7/u1D40:|u1D4J2Cst  , 
where the Cauchy stress /u1D6D4 is convected with the elastic spin /u1D416|u1D4J2Cst as, 
/u1D6D4/u1D45C.st=/u1D6D4̇−/u1D416|u1D4J2Cst/u1D6D4+/u1D6D4/u1D416|u1D4J2Cst  . 
This is equivalent to writing the constitutive mode l with respect to a set of directors 
whose direction is deﬁned by the plastic deformatio n [Bammann and Aifantis 1987, 
Bammann and Johnson 1987].  Decomposing both the sk ew symmetric and symmetric 
parts of the velocity gradient into elastic and pla stic parts, we write for the elastic 
stretching /u1D40:|u1D4J2Cst and the elastic spin /u1D416|u1D4J2Cst, 
/u1D40:|u1D4J2Cst=/u1D40:−/u1D40:|u1D4JDCst−/u1D40:|u1D461Cst/uni210E.st,/u1D416|u1D4J2Cst=/u1D416=/u1D416|u1D4JDCst  . 
Within this structure it is now necessary to prescr ibe an equation for the plastic spin /u1D416|u1D4JDCst 
in addition to the normally prescribed ﬂow rule for  /u1D40:|u1D4JDCst and the stretching due to the 
thermal expansion D|u1D461Cst/uni210E.st. As proposed, we assume a ﬂow rule of the form, 
/u1D40:|u1D4JDCst= |u1D4J3 (|u1D447)sinh |<racketleftCvJ|/u1D6CF| −/u1D̅05−/u1D44C(|u1D447)
|u1D449(|u1D447)|<racketriµhtCvJ/u1D6CF′
|dividesCv1/u1D6CF′|dividesCv1  . 
where |u1D447 is the temperature, /u1D̅05 is the scalar hardening variable, and /u1D6CF|minuteCst is the diﬀerence 
between the deviatoric Cauchy stress /u1D6D4|minuteCst and the tensor variable /u1D6C2|minuteCst, 
/u1D6CF|minuteCst=/u1D6D4|minuteCst−/u1D6C2|minuteCst  , 
and |u1D4J3 (|u1D447) , /u1D44C(|u1D447), and |u1D449(|u1D447)  are scalar functions whose speciﬁc dependence upon  the 
temperature is given below.  Assuming isotropic the rmal expansion and introducing 
the expansion coeﬃcient |u1D434̇, the thermal stretching can be written, 
/u1D40:|u1D461Cst/uni210E.st= |u1D434̇|u1D447̇/u1D̅CF 
The evolution of the internal variables /u1D6C2 and /u1D6CB are prescribed in a hardening minus 
recovery format as, 
/u1D6C2/u1D45C.st=ℎ(|u1D447)/u1D40:|u1D4JDCst− [|u1D4JF/u1D451.st(|u1D447)|dividesCv1/u1D40:|u1D4JDCst|dividesCv1 + |u1D4JF|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D447)]|/u1D6C2|/u1D6C2
/u1D6CB⋅=/u1D4:B(|u1D447)/u1D40:|u1D4JDCst− [|u1D44J/u1D451.st(|u1D447)|dividesCv1/u1D40:|u1D4JDCst|dividesCv1 + |u1D44J|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D447)]/u1D6CB|twoCst 
where ℎ and /u1D4:B are the hardening moduli, |u1D4JF|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D447) and |u1D44J|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D447) are scalar functions 
describing the diﬀusion controlled ‘static’ or ‘the rmal’ recovery, and |u1D4JF/u1D451.st(|u1D447) and |u1D44J/u1D451.st(|u1D447) 
are the functions describing dynamic recovery.   
 
If we assume that /u1D416|u1D4JDCst= 0, we recover the Jaumann stress rate which results in the 
prediction of an oscillatory shear stress response in simple shear when coupled with a 
Prager kinematic hardening assumption [Johnson and Bammann 1984].  Alternatively, 
we can choose, 
/u1D416|u1D4JDCst=/u1D411|u1D447Cst/u1D414̇/u1D414−|oneCst/u1D411, 
which recovers the Green-Naghdi rate of Cauchy stre ss and has been shown to be 
equivalent to Mandel’s isoclinic state [Bammann and  Aifantis 1987].  The model *MAT_051  *MAT_BAMMAN  
2-390 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 employing this rate allows a reasonable prediction of directional softening for some 
materials, but in general under-predicts the soften ing and does not accurately predict 
the axial stresses which occur in the torsion of th e thin walled tube. 
 
The ﬁnal equation necessary to complete our descrip tion of high strain rate deformation 
is one which allows us to compute the temperature c hange during the deformation.  In 
the absence of a coupled thermo-mechanical ﬁnite el ement code we assume adiabatic

Remarks: 
A rigid, low density, closed cell, polyurethane foa m model developed at Sandia 
Laboratories [Neilsen, Morgan and Krieg 1987] has b een recently implemented for 
modeling impact limiters in automotive applications .  A number of such foams were 
tested at Sandia and reasonable ﬁts to the experime ntal data were obtained. 
 
In some respects this model is similar to the crush able honeycomb model type 26 in that 
the components of the stress tensor are uncoupled u ntil full volumetric compaction is 
achieved.  However, unlike the honeycomb model this  material possesses no 
directionality but includes the eﬀects of conﬁned a ir pressure in its overall response 
characteristics. 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst s k − |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠∆air   , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst s k  is the skeletal stress and |u1D7≠∆air  is the air pressure.  |u1D7≠∆air  is computed from the 
equation: 
|u1D7≠∆air = −|u1D4JD|zeroCst|u1D6F∆
1 + |u1D6F∆ −/u1D̅1∫  , 
where |u1D4JD|zeroCst is the initial foam pressure, usually taken as the  atmospheric pressure, and |u1D6F∆ 
deﬁnes the volumetric strain  
|u1D6F∆ = |u1D449 − 1 + |u1D6F∆|zeroCst  . 
Here, |u1D449 is the relative volume, deﬁned as the ratio of the  current volume to the initial 
volume, and |u1D6F∆|zeroCst is the initial volumetric strain, which is typical ly zero.  The yield 
condition is applied to the principal skeletal stre sses, which are updated independently 
of the air pressure.  We ﬁrst obtain the skeletal s tresses: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst s k = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst + |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠∆air  
and compute the trial stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst s k t  
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst s k t  = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst s k + |u1D438 |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  ∆|u1D461  , 
where |u1D438 is Young’s modulus.  Since Poisson’s ratio is zero , the update of each stress 
component is uncoupled and 2|u1D43A = |u1D438  where |u1D43A is the shear modulus.  The yield 
condition is applied to the principal skeletal stre sses such that, if the magnitude of a 
principal trial stress component, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Csts k t , exceeds the yield stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst, then *MAT_053  *MAT_CLOSED_CELL_FOAM

The yield stress is deﬁned by 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D44∆ + |u1D44F(1 +/u1D450|u1D6F∆)  , 
where |u1D44∆, |u1D44F, and /u1D450 are user deﬁned input constants and |u1D6F∆ is the volumetric strain as 
deﬁned above.  After scaling the principal stresses  they are transformed back into the 
global system and the ﬁnal stress state is computed

These are  Material Types 54 - 55 which are enhanced versions of the composite model 
material type 22.  Arbitrary orthotropic materials,  such as unidirectional layers in 
composite shell structures, can be deﬁned.  Optiona lly, various types of failure can be 
speciﬁed following either the suggestions of [Chang  and Chang 1987b] or [Tsai and Wu 
1971].  In addition, special measures are taken for  failure under compression.  See 
[Matzenmiller and Schweizerhof 1991]. 
By using the user deﬁned integration rule, see *INT EGRATION_SHELL, the 
constitutive constants can vary through the shell t hickness.  For all shells, except the 
DKT formulation, laminated shell theory can be acti vated to properly model the 
transverse shear deformation.  Lamination theory is  applied to correct for the 
assumption of a uniform constant shear strain throu gh the thickness of the shell. 
For sandwich shells where the outer layers are much  stiﬀer than the inner layers, the 
response will tend to be too stiﬀ unless lamination  theory is used.  To turn on 
lamination theory, see *CONTROL_SHELL. A damage mod el for transverse shear strain 
to model interlaminar shear failure is available.  The deﬁnition of minimum stress limits 
is available for thin/thick shells and solids.

For |u1D6FD = 1  we get the original criterion of Hashin [1980] in the tensile ﬁber mode.  For 
|u1D6FD = 0  we get the maximum stress criterion which is found  to compare better to 
experiments. 
 
*MAT_054 with 2-Way Fiber Flag Failure Criteria

compressive matrix mode is given as:

Remarks: 
1.  Integration Point Failure.  In *MAT_054, failure can occur in any of four 
diﬀerent ways: 
• If DFAILT is zero, failure occurs if the Chang-Ch ang failure criterion is 
satisﬁed in the tensile ﬁber mode. 
• If DFAILT is greater than zero, failure occurs if : 
◦ the ﬁber strain is greater than DFAILT or less th an DFAILC 
◦ if absolute value of matrix strain is greater tha n DFAILM 
◦ if absolute value of tensorial shear strain is gr eater than DFAILS 
• If EFS is greater than zero, failure occurs if th e eﬀective strain is greater 
than EFS. 
• If TFAIL is greater than zero, failure occurs acc ording to the element 
timestep as described in the deﬁnition of TFAIL abo ve.   Reduction by

 Figure M54-1.   Direction dependent softening *MAT_ENHANCED_COMPOSITE_DAMAGE  *MAT_054-055  
LS-DYNA R13 2-411 (MAT) In *MAT_055, an integration point is deleted (all s tresses go to zero) only if the 
tensile stress at that point reaches XT. Other stre ngths, XC, YT, YC, SC serve to 
cap stresses but do not delete the integration poin t. 
When failure has occurred in all the composite laye rs (through-thickness inte- 
gration points), the element is deleted.  For brick s, the element is deleted after 
one integration point has met the failure criteria.   
2.  Crashfront Elements and Strength Reduction.   Elements which share nodes 
with a deleted element become “crashfront” elements  and can have their 
strengths reduced by using the SOFT parameter with TFAIL greater than zero.  
An earlier initiation of crashfront elements is pos sible by using parameter PFL.  
An optional direction dependent strength reduction can be invoked by setting 
0 < SOFT2 < 1. Then, SOFT equals a strength reducti on factor for ﬁber parallel 
failure and SOFT2 equals a strength reduction facto r for ﬁber orthogonal fail- 
ure.  Linear interpolation is used for angles in be tween.  See Figure M54-1 . 
3.  Transverse Shear Strain Damage Model.  In an optional damage model for 
transverse shear strain, out-of-plane stiﬀness (GBC  and GCA) can linearly de- 
crease to model interlaminar shear failure.  Damage  starts when eﬀective 
transverse shear strain

reaches EPSF. Final rupture occurs when eﬀective tr ansverse shear strain 
reaches EPSR. A maximum damage of TSMD (0.0 < TSMD < 0.99) cannot be 
exceeded.  See Figure M54-2 . transverse shear stiﬀness

2-412 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 4.  Failure/Damage Status.   The status in each layer (integration point) and 
element can be plotted using additional integration  point history variables.  
The number of additional integration point history variables for shells written 
to the LS-DYNA database is input by the *DATABASE_E XTENT_BINARY 
deﬁnition as variable NEIPS.  For Models 54 and 55 these additional history 
variables are tabulated below ( i = shell integration point):

Variable  Description Value 
1 ef( i) tensile ﬁber mode

4 ed( i) compressive matrix mode 
5 efail max[ef(ip)] 
6 dam damage parameter −1 – element intact

The variables in the table above are labeled by LS- PrePost simply as history 
variables 1 to 6.   
The three element history variables in the table be low, which represent the 
fraction of elastic (non-failed) integration points  in tensile ﬁber, compressive 
ﬁber, and tensile matrix modes, resp., are labeled as “eﬀective plastic strain” by 
LS-PrePost for integration points 1, 2, and 3.

5.  TI-Flag .  This applies only to transversal isotropic behavi or for *MAT_054 
solid elements.  The behavior in the |u1D44F /u1D450-plane is assumed to be isotropic, thus 
the elastic constants EC, PRCA and GCA are ignored and set according to the 
given values EA, EB, PRAB, and GAB. Damage in trans verse shear (EPSF, EP-*MAT_ENHANCED_COMPOSITE_DAMAGE  *MAT_054-055  
LS-DYNA R13 2-413 (MAT) SR, TSMD, SOFTG) is ignored.  The failure criterion  is evaluated by replacing  
|u1D7≠∆/˙.st/˙.st  and |u1D7≠∆|aCst /˙.st  with the corresponding stresses  |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst  and |u1D7≠∆|aCst|oneCst   in a principal stress 
frame rotated around the local a-axis.  The princip al axes 1 and 2 in the b-c 
plane are chosen such that ||u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst | ≥ ||u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst | is fulﬁlled. 
6.  Material Parameters.   PRBA is the minor Poisson's ratio if EA>EB, and t he 
major Poisson's ratio will be equal to PRBA*(EA/EB) .  If EB > EA, then PRBA 
is the major Poisson's ratio.  PRCA and PRCB are si milarly deﬁned.  They are 
the minor Poisson’s ratio if EA>EC or EB>EC, and th e major Poisson’s ratio if 
the EC>EA or EC>EB. 
Care should be taken when using material parameters  from third party prod- 
ucts regarding the directional indices |u1D44∆, |u1D44F and  /u1D450, as they may diﬀer from the 
deﬁnition used in LS-DYNA. For the direction indice s used in LS-DYNA see

Material Formulation: 
The compressive behavior is illustrated in Figure M57-1  where hysteresis upon 
unloading is shown.  This behavior under uniaxial l oading is assumed not to 
signiﬁcantly couple in the transverse directions.  In tension the material behaves in a 
linear fashion until tearing occurs.  Although our implementation may be somewhat 
unusual, it was motivated by Storakers [1986]. 
 
The model uses tabulated input data for the loading  curve where the nominal stresses 
are deﬁned as a function of the elongations, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst, which are deﬁned in terms of the 
principal stretches, |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst, as: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst− 1 
The negative of the principal elongations (negative  of principal engineering strains) are 
stored in an arbitrary order as extra history varia bles 16, 17, and 18 if ED = 0 and as 
extra history variables 28, 29, and 30 if ED > 0.   (See NEIPH in *DATABASE_EXTENT_-
BINARY for output of extra history variables.) The stretch ratios are found by solving Typical unloading
curves determined by
the hysteretic unloading
factor. With the shape
factor equal to unity.

5.0-8.0, and a small

LS-DYNA R13 2-417 (MAT) for the eigenvalues of the left stretch tensor, |u1D449|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , which is obtained using a polar 
decomposition of the deformation gradient matrix, |u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst .  Recall that,  
|u1D439|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D44J|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J8Cst /u1D448|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D449|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J8Cst |u1D44J|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
The update of |u1D449|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  follows the numerically stable approach of Taylor and Flanagan 
[1989].  After solving for the principal stretches,  we compute the elongations and, if the 
elongations are compressive, the corresponding valu es of the nominal stresses, /u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst are 
interpolated.  If the elongations are tensile, the nominal stresses are given by 
/u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D438|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst 
and the Cauchy stresses in the principal system bec ome 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst=/u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst
|u1D7≠6|u1D4J7Cst|u1D7≠6|u1D4J8Cst  . 
The stresses can now be transformed back into the g lobal system for the nodal force 
calculations. 
Remarks: 
1.  Decay Constant and Hysteretic Unloading.  When hysteretic unloading is 
used the reloading will follow the unloading curve if the decay constant, |u1D6FD, is 
set to zero.  If |u1D6FD is nonzero the decay to the original loading curve  is governed 
by the expression: 
1 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st |u1D461Cst   . 
2.  Bulk Viscosity.   The bulk viscosity, which generates a rate depend ent 
pressure, may cause an unexpected volumetric respon se and, consequently, it 
is optional with this model. 
3.  Hysteretic Unloading Factor.   The hysteretic unloading factor results in the 
unloading curve to lie beneath the loading curve as  shown in Figure M57-1  
This unloading provides energy dissipation which is  reasonable in certain 
kinds of foam. 
4.  Output.   Note that since this material has no eﬀective pla stic strain, the internal 
energy per initial volume is written into the outpu t databases. 
5.  Rate Effects.   Rate eﬀects are accounted for through linear visc oelasticity by a 
convolution integral of the form 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JFCst=/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst 
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F   , 
where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) is the relaxation function.  The stress tensor, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JFCst, augments the 
stresses determined from the foam, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D45:.st; consequently, the ﬁnal stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , is 
taken as the summation of the two contributions: *MAT_057  *MAT_LOW_DENSITY_FOAM  
2-418 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D45:.st+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JFCst  . 
Since we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, t he relaxation function is 
represented by one term from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst 
given by, 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D438/u1D451.st|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|oneCsts|u1D461Cst . 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a damper and 
spring in series.  We characterize this in the inpu t by a Young's modulus, |u1D438/u1D451.st, 
and decay constant, |u1D6FD|oneCst.  The formulation is performed in the local system of 
principal stretches where only the principal values  of stress are computed and 
triaxial coupling is avoided.  Consequently, the on e-dimensional nature of this 
foam material is unaﬀected by this addition of rate  eﬀects.  The addition of rate 
eﬀects necessitates twelve additional history varia bles per integration point.  
The cost and memory overhead of this model comes pr imarily from the need 
to “remember” the local system of principal stretch es. 
6.  Time Step Size.  The time step size is based on the current density and the 
maximum of the instantaneous loading slope, |u1D438, and KCON.  If KCON is un- 
deﬁned, the maximum slope in the loading curve is u sed instead. *MAT_LAMINATED_COMPOSITE_FABRIC  *MAT_058

Remarks: 
1.  Failure of an Element Layer.  ERODS, the maximum eﬀective strain, controls 
the failure of an element layer.  The maximum value  of ERODS, 1, is 100% 
straining.  The layer in the element is completely removed after the maximum 
eﬀective strain (compression/tension including shea r) is reached. 
2.  Stress Limits.   The stress limits are factors used to limit the s tress in the 
softening part to a given value, 
|u1D7≠∆|mCst|iCst|nCst = SLIM|u1D46J|u1D46J × strength, 
thus, the damage value is slightly modiﬁed such tha t elastoplastic like behav- 
ior is achieved with the threshold stress.  The SLI M xx  ﬁelds may range be- 
tween 0.0 and 1.0.  With a factor of 1.0, the stres s remains at a maximum value *MAT_058  *MAT_LAMINATED_COMPOSITE_FABRIC  
2-434 (MAT) LS-DYNA R13 identical to the strength, which is similar to idea l elastoplastic behavior.  For 
tensile failure a small value for SLIMT x is often reasonable; however, for com- 
pression SLIMC x = 1.0 is preferred.  This is also valid for the corr esponding 
shear value. 
If SLIM xx  is smaller than 1.0, then localization can be obse rved depending on 
the total behavior of the lay-up.  If the user is i ntentionally using SLIM xx  < 1.0, 
it is generally recommended to avoid a drop to zero  and set the value to some- 
thing in between 0.05 and 0.10. Then elastoplastic behavior is achieved in the 
limit which often leads to less numerical problems.   The defaults for SLIM xx  
are 10 -8. 
3.  Crashfront.   The crashfront-algorithm is started if and only i f a value for 
TSIZE is input.  Note that time step size, with ele ment elimination after the 
actual time step becomes smaller than TSIZE. 
4.  Damage.  The damage parameters can be written to the post pr ocessing 
database for each integration point as the ﬁrst thr ee additional element varia- 
bles and can be visualized. 
Material models with FS = 1 or FS = -1 are better f or complete laminates and 
fabrics, as all directions are treated in a similar  fashion. 
For material model FS = 1 an interaction between no rmal stresses and the shear 
stresses is assumed for the evolution of damage in the |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F-directions.  The /u1D̅0F 
|u1D6F∆ GAMMA1  TAU1  SC  
GMS  SLIMS = 1.0  
SLIMS = 0.9  
SLIMS = 0.6  
 Figure M58-2.   Stress-strain diagram for shear *MAT_LAMINATED_COMPOSITE_FABRIC  *MAT_058  
LS-DYNA R13 2-435 (MAT) shear damage is always the maximum value of the dam age from the criterion 
in the |u1D44∆ or |u1D44F-direction. 
For material model FS = -1 it is assumed that the d amage evolution is inde- 
pendent of any of the other stresses.  A coupling i s only present through the 
elastic material parameters and the complete struct ure.  In tensile and com- 
pression directions as well as in the |u1D44F-direction, diﬀerent failure surfaces can be 
assumed.  The damage values are monotonically incre asing and so a load re- 
versal from tension to compression, or compression to tension, does not result 
in a reduction of damage. 
5.  Shear Failure of Fabrics.   For fabric materials a nonlinear stress strain cu rve 
for the shear part for failure surface FS = -1 can be assumed as given below.  
This is not possible for other values of FS. 
The curve, shown in Figure M58-2  is deﬁned by three points: 
a)  the origin (0,0)  is assumed, 
b)  the limit of the ﬁrst slightly nonlinear part (mus t be input), stress (TAU1) 
and strain (GAMMA1), and 
c)  the shear strength at failure and shear strain at failure. 
In addition, a stress limiter can be used to keep t he stress constant using the 
SLIMS  ﬁeld.  This value must be positive and less than or  equal to 1.0.  It leads 
to an elastoplastic behavior for the shear part.  T he default is 10 -8, assuming 
almost brittle failure once the strength limit SC i s reached. 
6.  EC.   The EC ﬁeld is ignored when this material model i s used with thin shell 
elements.  When used with thick shell elements of f orm 1, 2, or 6, a positive EC 
value will be used to evaluate a thickness stress.  If EC is set to zero or a nega- 
tive number, then the minimum of EA and EB is used for the thickness stress 
calculation. 
7.  Strain Rate.  For any property speciﬁed to be strain-rate-depende nt, the 
smoothed, direction-appropriate strain rate is used .  For example, strain rate in 
the |u1D44∆-direction is used when assessing properties in the  |u1D44∆-direction.  The eﬀec- 
tive strain rate, however, is used when assessing t he rate-dependence of 
ERODS for load curve LCEFS.*MAT_059  *MAT_COMPOSITE_FAILURE_ OPTION _MODEL

This is Material Type 60 which was developed to sim ulate forming of glass products 
(such as car windshields) at high temperatures.  De formation is by viscous ﬂow, but 
elastic deformations can also be large.  The materi al model, in which the viscosity may 
vary with temperature, is suitable for treating a w ide range of viscous ﬂow problems 
and is implemented for brick and shell elements.

Remarks: 
Volumetric behavior is treated as linear elastic.  The deviatoric strain rate is considered 
to be the sum of elastic and viscous strain rates: 
/u1D6C6̇total |minuteCst=/u1D6C6̇elastic |minuteCst+/u1D6C6̇v iscous |minuteCst=/u1D6D4̇′
2|u1D43A+ /u1D6D4′
2|u1D463  , 
where |u1D43A is the elastic shear modulus, |u1D463 is the viscosity coeﬃcient, and bold indicates a 
tensor.  The stress increment over one timestep |u1D4J1|u1D461  is 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠∆|minuteCst = 2|u1D43A/u1D̅:Ȧtotal |u1D4J1|u1D461 −|u1D43A
|u1D71≠|u1D4J1|u1D461 σ|minuteCst  . 
The stress before the update is used for σ′.  For shell elements the through-thickness 
strain rate is calculated as follows: 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst = 0 = |u1D43∆(|u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst|oneCst + |u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst|twoCst + |u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|threeCst )|u1D4J1|u1D461 + 2|u1D43A|u1D7≠≠′̇|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4J1|u1D461 −|u1D43A
|u1D71≠|u1D4J1|u1D461|u1D7≠∆|minuteCst
|threeCst|threeCst   , 
where the subscript 33 denotes the through-thicknes s direction and |u1D43∆ is the elastic bulk 
modulus.  This leads to: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|threeCst = −|u1D44∆(|u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst|oneCst + |u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst|twoCst ) + |u1D44F|u1D4JD

This is Material Type 60 which was developed to sim ulate forming of glass products 
(such as car windshields) at high temperatures.  De formation is by viscous ﬂow, but 
elastic deformations can also be large.  The materi al model, in which the viscosity may 
vary with temperature, is suitable for treating a w ide range of viscous ﬂow problems 
and is implemented for brick and shell elements.  L oad curves are used to represent the 
temperature dependence of Poisson’s ratio, Young’s modulus, the coeﬃcient of 
expansion, and the viscosity.

V_LOG Flag for the form of V_LC:  
EQ.1.0:  The value speciﬁed in V_ LC is the natural logarithm of 
the viscosity, ln |u1D449. The value interpolated from the

cosity changes by orders of magnitude over the tem-
perature range of the data.

Remarks: 
Volumetric behavior is treated as linear elastic.  The deviatoric strain rate is considered 
to be the sum of elastic and viscous strain rates:

Remarks: 
The model consists of a nonlinear elastic stiﬀness in parallel with a viscous damper.  
The elastic stiﬀness is intended to limit total cru sh while the viscosity absorbs energy.  
The stiﬀness |u1D438|twoCst exists to prevent timestep problems.  It is used f or time step calculations 
as long as |u1D438|oneCst|u1D461Cst is smaller than |u1D438|twoCst.  It has to be carefully chosen to take into accou nt the 
stiﬀening eﬀects of the viscosity.  Both |u1D438|oneCst and |u1D449|twoCst are nonlinear with crush as follows: 
|u1D438|oneCst|u1D461Cst= |u1D438|oneCst|parenleftCv1|u1D449−|u1D4JBCst|oneCsts|parenriµhtCv1

 For lateral straining, individual Poisson’s ratios can be deﬁned for the elastic 
(PR) and the plastic (PRP) regime.  The associated ﬂow potential is given by

with plastic Possion’s ratio /u1D̅08pl  (PRP).  Hardening is deﬁned with yield curve or 
table LCID.  If LCID is a yield curve, it relates u niaxial yield stress as a function 
of equivalent plastic strain.  If LCID refers to a table, then rate dependence is 
taken into account.  The deﬁnition of parameter RFI LTF determines if plastic 
strain rates (RFILT = 0) or ﬁltered total strain ra tes (RFILTF > 0) are used.  In 
the latter case, exponential smoothing is used 
|u1D7≠≠̇a v g = RFILTF × |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst−|oneCsta v g + (1 − RFILTF) × |u1D7≠≠ ̇|u1D4JBCstcur   ,

Remarks: 
1.  Constitutive Relationship.  This material model follows a constitutive 
relationship of the form: 
|u1D7≠∆ =/u1D458|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JACst|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst  , 
where |u1D7≠∆ is the yield stress, |u1D7≠≠ is the eﬀective plastic strain, and |u1D7≠≠̇ is the eﬀective 
total strain rate (VP = 0), or the eﬀective plastic  strain rate (VP = 1).  The con- 
stants /u1D458, |u1D4JA, and |u1D4JB can be expressed as functions of eﬀective plastic strain or can 
be constant with respect to the plastic strain.  Th e case of no strain hardening 
can be obtained by setting the exponent of the plas tic strain equal to a very 
small positive value, such as 0.0001.  
The initial yield stress is obtained through:  
|u1D7≠∆|zeroCst=/u1D458|u1D7≠≠|zeroCst|u1D4JACst|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst  ,

2.  Superplastic Forming.  This model can be combined with the superplastic 
forming input (see *LOAD_SUPERPLASTIC_FORMING) to c ontrol the magni- 
tude of the pressure in the pressure boundary condi tions.  Controlling the 
pressure limits the eﬀective plastic strain rate so  that it does not exceed a max- 
imum value at any integration point within the mode l. *MAT_RATE_SENSITIVE_POWERLAW_PLASTICITY  *MAT_064

Remarks: 
1.  Flow Stress.   The Zerilli-Armstrong Material Model expresses th e ﬂow stress 
as follows.

 where |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain and |u1D7≠≠̇∗ is the eﬀective plastic strain 
rate deﬁned as 
|u1D7≠≠̇∗=|u1D7≠≠̇

|u1D7≠≠̇|zeroCst = 1, 10 -3, 10 -6 for time units of seconds, milliseconds, and micro seconds, 
respectively. 
b)  For BCC metals ( |u1D4JB > 0), 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D436|oneCst+ |u1D436|twoCst|u1D4J2|<racketleftCv1−/u1D4:6.st|threeCsts+/u1D4:6.st/four.sts/l.st|nCst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠Csṫ∗|parenriµhtCv1|<racketriµhtCv1|u1D447Cst+ [|u1D436|fiveCst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D4JBCst+ |u1D436|sixCst]|<racketleftCvJ|u1D7≠7(|u1D447)

2.  Heat Capacity.  The relationship between heat capacity (speciﬁc hea t) and 
temperature may be characterized by a cubic polynom ial equation as follows: 
|u1D436|u1D4JDCst= |u1D43A|oneCst+ |u1D43A|twoCst|u1D447 + |u1D43A|threeCst|u1D447|twoCst+ |u1D43A|fourCst|u1D447|threeCst 
3.  Viscoplastic Formulation.   A fully viscoplastic formulation is optional.  An  
additional cost is incurred but the improvement is results can be dramatic. *MAT_LINEAR_ELASTIC_DISCRETE_BEAM  *MAT_066

This is Material Type 66.  This material model is d eﬁned for simulating the eﬀects of a 
linear elastic beam by using six springs each actin g about one of the six local degrees-of-
freedom.  The two nodes deﬁning a beam may be coinc ident to give a zero length beam 
or oﬀset to give a ﬁnite length beam.  For ﬁnite le ngth discrete beams the absolute value 
of the variable SCOOR in the *SECTION_BEAM input sh ould be set to a value of 2.0, 
which causes the local |u1D4JF-axis to be aligned along the two nodes of the beam , to give 
physically correct behavior.  The distance between the nodes of a beam should not aﬀect 
the behavior of this model.  A triad is used to ori ent the beam for the directional 
springs.  Translational/rotational stiﬀness and vis cous damping eﬀects are considered 
for a local cartesian system; see Remark 1 .  Applications for this element include the 
modeling of joint stiﬀnesses.

Remarks: 
1.  Coordinate System and Orientation.   The formulation of the discrete beam 
(type 6) assumes that the beam is of zero length an d requires no orientation 
node.  A small distance between the nodes joined by  the beam is permitted.  
The local coordinate system which determines (|u1D4JF, |u1D46≠, |u1D461)  is given by the coordi- 
nate ID (see *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ OPTION ) in the cross-sectional input 
(see *SECTION_BEAM), where the global system is the  default.  The local co- *MAT_LINEAR_ELASTIC_DISCRETE_BEAM  *MAT_066  
 ordinate system axes can rotate with either node of  the beam or an average 
rotation of both nodes (see SCOOR variable in *SECT ION_BEAM). 
2.  Null Stiffness.   For null stiﬀness coeﬃcients, no forces correspon ding to these 
null values will develop.  The viscous damping coeﬃ cients are optional.

This is Material Type 67.  This material model is d eﬁned for simulating the eﬀects of 
nonlinear elastic and nonlinear viscous beams by us ing six springs each acting about 
one of the six local degrees-of-freedom.  The two n odes deﬁning a beam may be 
coincident to give a zero length beam or oﬀset to g ive a ﬁnite length beam.  For ﬁnite 
length discrete beams the absolute value of the var iable SCOOR in the *SECTION_-
BEAM input should be set to a value of 2.0, which a ligns the local |u1D4JF-axis along the two 
nodes of the beam to give physically correct behavi or.  The distance between the nodes 
of a beam should not aﬀect the behavior of this mat erial model.  A triad is used to orient 
the beam for the directional springs.  Arbitrary cu rves to model transitional/ rotational

Remarks: 
1.  Null Load Curve IDs.   For null load curve IDs, no forces are computed. 
2.  Discrete Beam Formulation.  The formulation of the discrete beam (type 6) 
assumes that the beam is of zero length and require s no orientation node.  A 
small distance between the nodes joined by the beam  is permitted.  The local 
coordinate system which determines (|u1D4JF, |u1D46≠, |u1D461)  is given by the coordinate ID (see 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_ OPTION ) in the cross-sectional input (see *SEC-
TION_BEAM) where the global system is the default.  The local coordinate 
system axes can rotate with either node of the beam  or an average rotation of 
both nodes (see SCOOR variable in *SECTION_BEAM). 
3.  Tension and Compression.   If diﬀerent behavior in tension and compression 
is desired in the calculation of the force resultan ts, the load curve(s) must be 
deﬁned in the negative quadrant starting with the m ost negative displacement 
then increasing monotonically to the most positive.   If the load curve behaves 
similarly in tension and compression, deﬁne only th e positive quadrant.   
Whenever displacement values fall outside of the de ﬁned range, the resultant 
forces will be extrapolated.  Figure M67-1  depicts a typical load curve for a 
force resultant.  Load curves used for determining the damping forces and 
moment resultants always act identically in tension  and compression, since DISPLACEMENT| |DISPLACEMENT(a) (b)RESULTANT
RESULTANT
Figure M67-1.   The resultant forces and moments are determined by a tab le 
lookup.  If the origin of the load curve is at [0,0]  as in (b) and tension and 
compression responses are symmetric. *MAT_NONLINEAR_ELASTIC_DISCRETE_BEAM  *MAT_067  
 only the positive quadrant values are considered, t hat is, start the load curve at 
the origin [0,0] . 
4.  Failure.  Catastrophic failure based on force resultants occu rs if the following 
inequality is satisﬁed.

After failure the discrete element is deleted.  Lik ewise, catastrophic failure 
based on displacement resultants occurs if the foll owing inequality is satisﬁed:

− 1. ≥ 0  . 
After failure, the discrete element is deleted.  If  failure is included, either or 
both of the criteria may be used.

 *MAT_NONLINEAR_PLASTIC_DISCRETE_BEAM  
This is Material Type 68.  This material model is f or simulating the eﬀects of nonlinear 
elastoplastic, linear viscous behavior of beams by using six springs each acting about 
one of the six local degrees-of-freedom.  The two n odes deﬁning a beam may be 
coincident to give a zero length beam or oﬀset to g ive a ﬁnite length beam.  For ﬁnite 
length discrete beams, the absolute value of the va riable SCOOR in the *SECTION_-
BEAM input should be set to a value of 2.0, which a ligns the local |u1D4JF-axis along the two 
nodes of the beam to give physically correct behavi or.  The distance between the nodes 
of a beam should not aﬀect the behavior of this mat erial model.  A triad orients the 
beam for the directional springs.  Translational/ro tational stiﬀness and damping eﬀects 
can be considered.  The plastic behavior is modeled  using force/moment curves as a 
function of displacements/rotation.  Optionally, fa ilure can be speciﬁed based on a 
force/moment criterion and a displacement rotation criterion.  See also the remarks 
below.

3.  Discrete Beam Formulation.   The formulation of the discrete beam (type 6) 
assumes that the beam is of zero length and require s no orientation node.  A 
small distance between the nodes joined by the beam  is permitted.  The local

system axes can rotate with either node of the beam  or an average rotation of 
both nodes (see SCOOR variable in *SECTION_BEAM).

 Remarks: 
As the damper moves, the ﬂuid ﬂows through the open  oriﬁces to provide the 
necessary damping resistance.  While moving as show n in Figure M69-1 , the piston 
gradually blocks oﬀ and eﬀectively closes the oriﬁc es.  The number of oriﬁces and the 
size of their opening control the damper resistance  and performance.  The damping

In the implementation, the oriﬁces are assumed to b e circular with partial covering by 
the oriﬁce controller.  As the piston closes, the c losure of the oriﬁce is gradual.  This 
gradual closure is properly taken into account to i nsure a smooth response.  If the 
piston stroke is exceeded, the stiﬀness value, /u1D458, limits further movement, meaning if the 
damper bottoms out in tension or compression the da mper forces are calculated by 
replacing the damper by a bottoming out spring and damper, /u1D458 and /u1D450, respectively.  The 
piston stroke must exceed the initial length of the  beam element.  The time step 
calculation is based in part on the stiﬀness value of the bottoming out spring.  A typical DISPLACEMENTF

Remarks: 
As the damper is compressed two actions contribute to the force which develops.  First, 
the gas is adiabatically compressed into a smaller volume.  Secondly, oil is forced 
through an oriﬁce.  A proﬁled pin may occupy some o f the cross-sectional area of the 
oriﬁce; thus, the oriﬁce area available for the oil  varies with the stroke.  The force is 
assumed proportional to the square of the velocity and inversely proportional to the 
available area.

Remarks: 
The force, F, generated by the cable is nonzero if and only if the cable is tension.  The 
force is given by: 
|u1D439 = max(|u1D439|zeroCst+ |u1D43∆∆/u1D4:F, 0. ) 
where ∆L is the change in length  
∆/u1D4:F= current length − |parenleftCv1initial length − offset|parenriµhtCv1 
and the stiﬀness (E > 0.0 only ) is deﬁned as: 
|u1D43∆ =|u1D438 × area 
|parenleftCv1initial length − offset|parenriµhtCv1 
Note that a constant force element can be obtained by setting: 
|u1D439|zeroCst> 0 and |u1D43∆ = 0 
although the application of such an element is unkn own. 
 
The area and oﬀset are deﬁned on either the cross s ection or element cards.  For a slack 
cable the oﬀset should be input as a negative lengt h.  For an initial tensile force the 
oﬀset should be positive. 
 
If a load curve is speciﬁed the Young’s modulus wil l be ignored and the load curve will 
be used instead.  The points on the load curve are deﬁned as engineering stress versus 
engineering strain, i.e., the change in length over  the initial length.  The unloading 
behavior follows the loading. 
 *MAT_CABLE_DISCRETE_BEAM  *MAT_071  
 By default, cable pretension is applied only at the  start of the analysis.  If the cable is 
attached to ﬂexible structure, deformation of the s tructure will result in relaxation of the 
cables, which will therefore lose some or all of th e intended preload. 
 
This can be overcome by using TMAXF0. In this case,  it is expected that the structure 
will deform under the loading from the cables and t hat this deformation will take time 
to occur during the analysis.  The unstressed lengt h of the cable will be continuously 
adjusted until time TMAXF0 such that the force is m aintained at the user-deﬁned pre-
tension force – this is analogous to operation of t he pre-tensioning screws in real cables.  
After time TMAXF0, the unstressed length is ﬁxed an d the force in the cable is 
determined in the normal way using the stiﬀness and  change of length. 
 
Sudden application of the cable forces at time zero  may result in an excessively dynamic 
response during pre-tensioning.  A ramp-up time TRA MP may optionally be deﬁned.  
The cable force ramps up from zero at time TSTART t o the full pre-tension F0 at time 
TSTART + TRAMP. TMAXF0, if set less than TSTART + T RAMP by the user, will be 
internally reset to TSTART + TRAMP. 
 
If the model does not use dynamic relaxation, it is  recommended that damping be 
applied during pre-tensioning so that the structure  reaches a steady state by time 
TMAXF0. 
 
If the model uses dynamic relaxation, TSTART, TRAMP , and TMAXF0 apply only 
during dynamic relaxation.  The cable preload at th e end of dynamic relaxation carries 
over to the start of the subsequent transient analy sis.  
 
The cable mass will be calculated from length × area × density if VOL is set to zero on 
*SECTION_BEAM. Otherwise, VOL × density will be used. 
 
If OUTPUT is set to 1, one additional history varia ble representing axial strain is output 
to d3plot for the cable elements.  This axial strai n can be plotted by LS-PrePost by 
selecting the beam component labeled as “axial stre ss”.  Though the label says “axial 
stress”, it is actually axial strain. 
 
If the stress-strain load curve option, LCID, is co mbined with preload, two types of 
behavior are available: 
1.  If the preload is applied using the TMAXF0/TRAMP m ethod, the initial strain 
is calculated from the stress-strain curve to achie ve the desired preload. 
2.  If TMAXF0/TRAMP are not used, the preload force is  taken as additional to 
the force calculated from the stress/strain curve.  Thus, the total stress in the 
cable will be higher than indicated by the stress/s train curve. *MAT_072  *MAT_CONCRETE_DAMAGE

This is Material Type 72R3. The Karagozian & Case ( K&C) Concrete Model - Release III 
is a three-invariant model, uses three shear failur e surfaces, includes damage and 
strain-rate eﬀects, and has origins based on the Ps eudo-TENSOR Model (Material Type 
16).  The most signiﬁcant user improvement provided  by Release III is a model 
parameter generation capability, based solely on th e unconﬁned compression strength 
of the concrete.  The implementation of Release III  signiﬁcantly changed the user input, 
thus previous input ﬁles using Material Type 72 pri or to LS-DYNA Version 971, are not 
compatible with the present input format. 
An open source reference, that precedes the paramet er generation capability, is 
provided in Malvar et al.  [1997].  A workshop proc eedings reference, Malvar et al.  
[1996], is useful, but may be diﬃcult to obtain.  M ore recent, but limited distribution  
reference materials, such as Malvar et al.  [2000],  may be obtained by contacting 
Karagozian & Case. 
Seven card images are required to deﬁne the complete  set of model parameters for the 
K&C Concrete Model.  An Equation-of-State is also r equired for the pressure-volume 
strain response.  Brief descriptions of all the inp ut parameters are provided below, 
however it is expected that this model will be used  primarily with the option to 
automatically generate the model parameters based o n the unconﬁned compression 
strength of the concrete.  These generated material  parameters, along with the 
generated parameters for *EOS_TABULATED_COMPACTION,  are written to the 
d3hsp  ﬁle.

λ, sometimes referred to as “modiﬁed” eﬀective plast ic strain, is computed internally as 
a function of eﬀective plastic strain, strain rate enhancement factor, and pressure.  η is a 
function of λ as speciﬁed by the η as a function of λ curve.  The η value, which is always 
between 0 and 1, is used to interpolate between the  yield failure surface and the 
maximum failure surface or between the maximum fail ure surface and the residual *MAT_072R3  *MAT_CONCRETE_DAMAGE_REL3  
 failure surface, depending on whether λ is to the left or right of the ﬁrst peak in the η as 
a function of λ curve.  The “scaled damage measure” ranges from 0 to 1 as the material 
transitions from the yield failure surface to the m aximum failure surface, and thereafter 
ranges from 1 to 2 as the material ranges from the maximum failure surface to the 
residual failure surface.  See the references for d etails.

KCON Stiﬀness coeﬃcient for contact interface stiﬀness.  If undeﬁned, 
the maximum slope in the stress as a function of st rain curve is 
used.  When the maximum slope is taken for the cont act, the time

LCID2 Load curve ID of relaxation curve.  If LCID2 > 0, constants |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst and 
|u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst are determined using a least squares ﬁt.  An examp le is shown

BSTART Fit parameter.  In the ﬁt, |u1D6FD|oneCst is set to zero, |u1D6FD|twoCst  is set to BSTART, |u1D6FD|threeCst
is 10 times |u1D6FD|twoCst, |u1D6FD|fourCst is 10 times greater than |u1D6FD|threeCst , and so on.  If zero, 
BSTART = .01. 
TRAMP Optional ramp time for loading 
NV Number of terms in ﬁt.  Currently, the maximum numb er is 6.  
Since each term used adds signiﬁcantly to the cost,  2 or 3 terms is 
recommended.  Ca ution should be exercised when taking the 
results from the ﬁt.  Preferably, all generated coe ﬃcients should 
be positive because negative values may lead to uns table results.  
Once a satisfactory ﬁt has been achieved, we recomm end using 
the output coeﬃcients in future runs.

taken as the summation of the two contributions: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D45:.st+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JFCst  . 
Since we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, t he relaxation function is 
represented by up to six terms of the Prony series:  
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst  . 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a dampers and 
springs in series.  The formulation is performed in  the local system of principal 
stretches where only the principal values of stress  are computed and triaxial 
coupling is avoided.  Consequently, the one-dimensi onal nature of this foam 
material is unaﬀected by this addition of rate eﬀec ts.  The addition of rate 
eﬀects necessitates 42 additional history variables  per integration point.  The 
cost and memory overhead of this model comes primar ily from the need to 
“remember” the local system of principal stretches and the evaluation of the 
viscous stress components. 
Frequency data can be ﬁt to the Prony series.  Usin g Fourier transforms the 
relationship between the relaxation function and th e frequency dependent data 
is 
|u1D43A|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D714) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1|u1D6F+|u1D4JACst(|u1D714/|u1D6FD|u1D4JACst)|twoCst

 3.  Hysteretic Unloading.   When hysteretic unloading is used, the reloading will 
follow the unloading curve if the decay constant, |u1D6FD, is set to zero.  If |u1D6FD is non- 
zero, the decay to the original loading curve is go verned by the expression: 
1 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st |u1D461Cst  
The bulk viscosity, which generates a rate dependen t pressure, may cause an 
unexpected volumetric response and, consequently, i t is optional with this 
model. 
The hysteretic unloading factor results in the unlo ading curve to lie beneath 
the loading curve as shown in Figure M57-1 .  This unloading provides energy 
dissipation which is reasonable in certain kinds of  foam. *MAT_074  *MAT_ELASTIC_SPRING_DISCRETE_BEAM

|u1D439 = |u1D439|zeroCst+ K∆/u1D4:F+ D∆/u1D4:Ḟ  . 
But if the load curve ID is speciﬁed, the force is then given by: 
|u1D439 = |u1D439|zeroCst+ K|u1D4J3 (∆/u1D4:F)/˙raceleft.v61 + C1 × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ+ C2 × sgn|parenleftCv1∆/u1D4:Ḟ|parenriµhtCv1ln |<racketleftCv6max |parenleftCv61. ,∆/u1D4:Ḟ

VTC Variable tension cutoﬀ for uniaxial tensile stress as a fraction of

PR Poisson’s ratio, which applies to both elastic and plastic 
deformations.  It must be smaller then 0.5. 
KCON Stiﬀness coeﬃcient for contact interface stiﬀness.  If undeﬁned 
one- third of Young’s modulus, E, is used.  KCON is also  
considered in the elem ent time step calculation; therefore, large

ISFLG Flag for tensile response (active only if negative abscissa are 
present in load curve LCUYS):

1.  Volumetric Strain.   The logarithmic volumetric strain is deﬁned in te rms of 
the relative volume, |u1D449, as: 
|u1D6F∆ = −ln(|u1D449)

 The stress and strain pairs in load curve LCPY shou ld be positive values start- 
ing with a volumetric strain value of zero. 
2.  LCUYS.   The load curve LCUYS can optionally contain the r esults of the 
tensile test (corresponding to negative values of t he volumetric strain); if it 
does, then the load curve information will override  PC, VPC, TC and VTC. 
This is the recommended approach, because the neces sary continuity between 
tensile and compressive regime becomes obvious (see  Figure M75-1 ). 
3.  Yield Surface.   The yield surface is deﬁned as an ellipse in the equivalent 
pressure and von Mises stress plane.  This ellipse is characterized by three 
points: 
a)  the hydrostatic compression limit (LCPY), 
b)  the uniaxial compression limit (LCUYS), and 
c)  either the pressure cutoﬀ for hydrostatic stress ( PC,VPC), the tension cut- 
oﬀ for uniaxial tension (TC,VTC), or the optional t ensile part of LCUYS. 
4.  High Frequency Oscillations.  To prevent high frequency oscillations in the 
strain rate from causing similar high frequency osc illations in the yield stress, a 
modiﬁed volumetric strain rate is used to obtain th e scaled yield stress.  The 
modiﬁed strain rate is obtained as follows.  If NYC LE is > 1, then the modiﬁed 
strain rate is obtained by a time average of the ac tual strain rate over NCYCLE 
solution cycles.  The averaged strain rate is store d in history variable #3. Volumetric Strain True Stress

The material model can also be used with laminated shells.  Either an elastic or

shells, you must set the laminated formulation ﬂag on *CONTROL_SHELL. With the 
laminated option you must also deﬁne an integration  rule.  The addition of an elastic or

Figure M76-1.   Relaxation curves for deviatoric behavior and bulk beh avior.  
The ordinate of LCID is the deviatoric stress divided  by 2 times the constant 
value of deviatoric strain where the stress and strain are in the direction of the 
prescribed strain, or in non-di rectional terms, the eﬀective stress divided by 3 
times the eﬀective strain.  LCIDK deﬁnes the mean stre ss divided by the 
constant value of volumetric strain imposed in a hydros tatic stress relaxation 
experiment as a function of time.  For best results, the points deﬁned in the 
curve should be equally spaced on the logarithmic scal e.  Note the values for the 
abscissa are input as time, not log(time). Furthermore, the curve should be smooth 
and deﬁned in the positive quadrant.  If nonphysical value s are determined by 
least squares ﬁt, LS-DY NA will terminate with an error message after the 
initialization phase is completed.  If the ramp time for loading is included, then

added to the stress tensor determined from the stra in energy functional. 
 
If we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, the relaxation function is represented by 
18 terms from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
We characterize this in the input by shear moduli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and decay constants, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.  An 
arbitrary number of terms, up to 18, may be used wh en applying the viscoelastic model. 
 
For volumetric relaxation, the relaxation function is also represented by the Prony series 
in terms of bulk moduli: 
/u1D458(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43∆|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J8Csts/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
The Arrhenius and Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) shift  functions account for the eﬀects 
of the temperature on the stress relaxation.  A sca led time, |u1D461|minuteCst, 
|u1D461′=/integral.v:Φ(|u1D447)|u1D4J1|u1D461 |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst 
is used in the relaxation function instead of the p hysical time.  The Arrhenius shift 
function is 
Φ(|u1D447) = exp |<racketleftCvJ−|u1D434 |parenleftCvJ1
|u1D447−1
|u1D447REF |parenriµhtCvJ|<racketriµhtCvJ 
and the Williams-Landel-Ferry shift function is 
Φ(|u1D447) = exp |parenleftCvJ−|u1D434|u1D447 − |u1D447REF 
|u1D43J + |u1D447 − |u1D447REF |parenriµhtCvJ 
If all three values (TREF, A, and B) are nonzero, t he WLF function is used; the 
Arrhenius function is used if B is zero; and no sca ling is applied if all three values are 
zero. 
 
The moisture model allows the scaling of the materi al properties as a function of the 
moisture content of the material.  The shear and bu lk moduli are scaled by  |u1D6F+, the decay 
constants are scaled by |u1D6FD, and a moisture strain, |u1D6F∆(|u1D44≠)[|u1D44≠ − |u1D44≠/u1D442.st] is introduced 
analogous to the thermal strain. *MAT_HYPERELASTIC_RUBBER  *MAT_077_H

Background: 
Rubber is generally considered to be fully incompre ssible since the bulk modulus 
greatly exceeds the shear modulus in magnitude.  To  model the rubber as an 
unconstrained material a hydrostatic work term, /u1D44A|u1D43BCst(/u1D4:D), is included in the strain energy 
functional which is function of the relative volume , /u1D4:D, [Ogden 1984]: 
/u1D44A(/u1D4:D|oneCst,/u1D4:D|twoCst,/u1D4:D) = |summationCv1 |u1D436|u1D4JDCst /u1D45E.st(/u1D4:D|oneCst− 3)|u1D4JDCst(/u1D4:D|twoCst− 3)/u1D45E.st+/u1D44A|u1D43BCst(/u1D4:D)|u1D4JBCst

 In order to prevent volumetric work from contributi ng to the hydrostatic work the ﬁrst 
and second invariants are modiﬁed as shown.  This p rocedure is described in more 
detail by Sussman and Bathe [1987].  The second Pio la-Kirchhoﬀ and Cauchy stress 
tensors are obtained from the strain energy functio nal as 
/u1D4̅A=|u1D71J /u1D44A 
|u1D71J/u1D46C,        /u1D̅48/u1D44A.st=1
/u1D4:D/u1D46D/u1D4̅A/u1D46D|u1D447Cst, 
where /u1D46C is the Green strain tensor and /u1D46D is the deformation gradient.  We use the 
subscript /u1D44A here to denote the contribution from the strain en ergy potential, and with 
no other contributions the resulting Cauchy stress is simply 
/u1D̅48=/u1D̅48/u1D44A.st. 
 
Rate eﬀects are taken into account through linear v iscoelasticity by adding a sequence 
of stress contributions 
/u1D̅48|u1D449Cst= |summationCv1/u1D̅48|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst 
where each term is known as a Prony  term.  Each such stress component /u1D̅48|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst evolves 
with deformation and time as 
|parenleftCv2/u1D̅48|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst|parenriµhtCv2/u1D6FB.st= 2|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|parenleftCv2/u1D46B− |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts(|u1D461Cst−|u1D461Cst |zeroCsts)|u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst/u1D̅:A|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst|parenriµhtCv2,        |parenleftCv2/u1D̅:A|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst|parenriµhtCv2/na˙la.st= |u1D4J2/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts(|u1D461Cst−|u1D461Cst |zeroCsts)/u1D46B. 
Here ∇ denotes the Jaumann rate. /u1D46B is  the rate-of-deformation tensor, |u1D461 is time and |u1D461|zeroCst is 
an arbitrary time point.  Each term has an internal  strain /u1D̅:A|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst associated with itself, which 
incorporates the memory properties a viscoelastic m aterial typically possesses.  This 
stress is added to the stress tensor determined fro m the strain energy functional, so that 
/u1D̅48=/u1D̅48/u1D44A.st+/u1D̅48|u1D449Cst. 
 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of dampers and springs in 
series. An arbitrary number of such Prony terms can  be input, each characterized by the 
shear modulus, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and relaxation coeﬃcient, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst. To avoid a constant shear modulus 
from this viscoelastic formulation, a term in the s eries is included only when  |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst> 0. 
 
For the sake of understanding the inﬂuence these te rms have on the rate eﬀects of 
viscoelasticity, let’s investigate the model in a s ituation with no spin and constant rate-
of-deformation with /u1D46B≠/u1D̅CE. This means that the Jaumann rate is simply diﬀere ntiation 
with time, and we can look at the implications a sp eciﬁc term has.  To make some 
physical sense of things, we deal with both the no hyperelastic material present and the 
hyperelastic material present cases.  For the latte r we assume an elastic shear modulus, 
|u1D43A, for the hyperelastic material.  
1.  Constant strain rate, /u1D46B. For the special case of constant strain rate, /u1D46B, we 
have the following expression for the stress rate 
/u1D̅48̇|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst= 2|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts|u1D461Cst/u1D46B, *MAT_HYPERELASTIC_RUBBER  *MAT_077_H  
 so each term contributes with an instantaneous shea r stiﬀness of |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst that decays 
with time at a rate determined by |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst. If we deﬁne the relaxation time as 
/u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst= 1 |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst⁄ , 
we see that the term will not contribute much to th e response when |u1D461 > 5/u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst. So 
with several Prony terms with diﬀerent relaxation p roperties, the overall visco- 
elastic stiﬀness decays roughly with steps of |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst in time spans of /u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst. This infor- 
mation can be used for determining the material dat a by making clever use of 
tensile tests at diﬀerent strain rates.  Looking at  the corresponding stress con- 
tribution from each term 
/u1D̅48|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst= 2|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst
|u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts|u1D461Cst|parenriµhtCv2/u1D46B 
we see that the stress stabilizes at a nonzero leve l 2/u1D4:A.st|u1D4J6Csts
/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts/u1D46B as time goes to inﬁnity.  
See Figure M77-1 . 
 
 
2.  Relaxation.  To see its eﬀect on stress relaxation, we assume t he material has 
deformed with a constant rate-of-deformation /u1D46B|zeroCst≠/u1D̅CE between time 0 and |u1D461|zeroCst, 
and then continues with another constant rate-of-de formation /u1D46B (which we 
allow to be zero) after time |u1D461|zeroCst (see Figure M77-2 ). The expression for the stress 
is 
/u1D̅48|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts(|u1D461Cst−|u1D461Cst |zeroCsts)/u1D̅48|zeroCst|u1D4J6Cst+ 2|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst
|u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts(|u1D461Cst−|u1D461Cst |zeroCsts)|parenriµhtCv2/u1D46B, 
where /u1D̅48|zeroCst|u1D4J6Cst is the stress level that was reached at time |u1D461|zeroCst. Stress relaxation occurs 
when /u1D46B=/u1D̅CE for which we see that the stress decays (or relaxes ) to zero at a rate 
determined by |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst. When a hyperelastic material is included, the str ess is re- 
laxed to the hyperelastic stress, illustrated by a dashed line in the ﬁgure.  As 
before, when combining many terms with diﬀerent rel axation properties, the 
stress relaxes in steps of /u1D̅48|zeroCst|u1D4J6Cst in time spans of /u1D̅0F|u1D4J6Cst and essentially determines the Gi

material parameters. 
 
 
3.  Creep.  For creep, we assume the same situation but instea d of prescribing the 
strain rate, /u1D46B, we enforce the stress, /u1D̅48, to be constant after time |u1D461|zeroCst. The expres- 
sion for the creep strain, /u1D̅:A|u1D4J≠Cst, in the non-presence of a hyperelastic material be - 
comes 
/u1D̅:A|u1D4J≠Cst=|u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst
2|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D461 − |u1D461|zeroCst)/u1D̅48|zeroCst|u1D4J6Cst, 
which indicates that the creep strain evolves linea rly with time (see Fig- 
ure M77-3 ). This is a rather non-physical behavior, but in t he presence of a 
hyperelastic material the creep evolves as 
/u1D̅:A|u1D4J≠Cst=1
2|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cstln /˙raceleft.v6|u1D43A + |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst
|u1D43A + |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts(|u1D461Cst−|u1D461Cst |zeroCsts)/˙raceright.v6/u1D̅48|zeroCst|u1D4J6Cst 
and saturates as one would expect to a constant val ue.  With many such terms, 
the creep evolves in a quantitatively diﬀerent mann er, but the qualitative be- 
havior is to be understood as described. 
 
The Mooney-Rivlin rubber model (model 27) is obtain ed by specifying /u1D441= 1.  Despite 
the diﬀerences in formulations, we ﬁnd that the res ults obtained with this model are 
nearly identical with those of material 27 as long as large values of Poisson’s ratio are 
used. 
 
Frequency independent damping is obtained by having  a spring and slider in series as

Remarks: 
1.  Hysteresis (TBHYS > 0).   If a positive table ID for hysteresis is deﬁned , then TB-
HYS is a table having curves that are functions of strain-energy density.  Let 
/u1D44A/d.st |eCst|vCst  be the current value of the deviatoric strain ener gy density as calculated 
above.  Furthermore, let /u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst  be the peak strain energy density reached up to 
this point in time.  It is then assumed that the re sulting stress is reduced by a 
damage factor according to 
/u1D412= |u1D437|parenleftCv1/u1D44A/d.st |eCst|vCst ,/u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst |parenriµhtCv1∂/u1D44A/d.st |eCst|vCst

This table consists of curves giving stress reducti on (between 0 and 1) as a 
function of /u1D44Ade v  indexed by /u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst . 
Each /u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst  curve must be valid for strain energy densities be tween 0 and /u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst .  
It is recommended  that each curve be monotonically increasing, and i t is required  
that each curve equals 1 when /u1D44Ade v >/u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rtde v .  Additionally, *DEFINE_TABLE 
requires  that each curve have the same beginning and end po int and, further- 
more, that they not cross except at the boundaries,  although they are not re- 
quired to cross. 
This table can be roughly estimated from a uniaxial  quasistatic compression 
test as follows (see Figure  for an illustration of  the diﬀerent curves):

c)  The strain energy density is, then, given as a fun ction of the loaded dis-

ii)  From this energy curve we can also determine the i nverse, 
|u1D4J1(/u1D44A/d.st |eCst|vCst ).  Using this inverse the load curve for LS-DYNA is then 
given by:

 2.  Hysteresis (TBHYS < 0).   If a negative table ID for hysteresis is deﬁned, th en 
all of the above holds with the diﬀerence being tha t the load curves comprising 
table, |TB HY S|, must give the strain-energy density, /u1D44Ade v , as a function of the 
stress reduction factor.  This scheme guarantees that all curves have the sam e begin- 
ning point, 0, and the same end point, 1.   For negative TBHYS the user provides 
/u1D44A/d.st |eCst|vCst (|u1D437,/u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst ) instead of |u1D437(/u1D44A/d.st |eCst|vCst ,/u1D44A/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt/d.st |eCst|vCst ).

PR Poisson’s ratio ( ≥ .49 is recommended; smaller values may not 
work and should not be used).  If this is set to a negative number, 
then the absolute value is used, and an extra card is read for 
Mullins eﬀect. 
N Order of ﬁt to curve LCID1 for the Ogden model, ( currently < 9, 2 
generally works okay).  The constants generated dur ing the ﬁt are 
printed in d3hsp and can be directly input in futur e runs, ther eby, 
saving the cost of performing the nonlinear ﬁt.  Th e goodness of 
the ﬁt can be visually evaluated by plotting data i n the output ﬁle 
curveplot*  using LS-PrePost (click  XYplot  → Add  to read the 
curveplot*  ﬁle). 
NV Number of Prony series terms for ﬁtting curve LCID2 .  If zero, the 
default is 6.  Currently, the maximum number is set  to 12.  Values 
less than 12, possibly 3 – 5, are recommended, since each term 
used adds signiﬁcantly to the cost.  Caution should  be ex ercised 
when taking the results from the ﬁt.  Preferably, a ll generated 
coeﬃcients should be positive.  Negative values may  lead to 
unstable results.  Once a satisfactory ﬁt has been achieved, it is 
recommended that the coeﬃcients which are written i nto the 
output ﬁle be input in future runs. 
G Shear modulus for frequency independent damping.  F requency 
independent damping is based on a spring and slider  in series.  
The critical stress for the slider mechanism is SIG F deﬁned below.  
For the best results, the value of G should be 250 - 1000 times 
greater than SIGF.

LCID2 Load curve ID of the deviatoric stress relaxation c urve, neglecting 
the long term deviatoric stress.  If LCID2 is given , constants |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst
and |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst are determined using a least squares ﬁt.  See M76-1  for an 
example relaxation curve.  The ordinate of the curv e is the 
viscoelastic deviatoric stress divided by the quant ity 2 times the 
constant value of deviatoric strain where the stres s and strain are 
in the direction of the prescribed strain.  If in n on-directional 
terms, it is the eﬀective stress divided by the qua ntity 3 times the 
eﬀective strain.

VFLAG Flag for the viscoelasticity formulation.  This app ears only on the 
ﬁrst line deﬁning G i, BETA i, and VFLAG. If VFLAG = 0, the 
standard viscoelasticity formulation is used (the d efault), and if 
VFLAG = 1 (only applicable to solid elements), the viscoela sticity 
formulation using the instantaneous elastic stress is used. 
Remarks: 
Rubber is generally considered to be fully incompre ssible since the bulk modulus 
greatly exceeds the shear modulus in magnitude.  To  model the rubber as an 
unconstrained material, a hydrostatic work term is included in the strain energy 
functional that is a function of the relative volum e, /u1D4:D, [Ogden 1984]: 
/u1D44A∗= |summationCv1 |summationCv1|u1D7≠7|u1D4J7Cst

The asterisk (*) indicates that the volumetric eﬀec ts have been eliminated from the 
principal stretches,  |u1D7≠6|u1D4J7Cst∗.  The number of terms, |u1D4JB, may vary from 1 to 8 inclusive, and |u1D43∆ is 
the bulk modulus. 
 
Rate eﬀects are taken into account through linear v iscoelasticity by a convolution 
integral of the form: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D461Cst

or in terms of the second Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress, |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  , and Green's strain tensor, |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , *MAT_OGDEN_RUBBER  *MAT_077_O  
 |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D438|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst 
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst 
where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) and |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) are the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent stre ss 
measures.  This stress is added to the stress tenso r determined from the strain energy 
functional. 
 
If we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, the relaxation function is represented by 
six terms from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st |u1D461Cst |u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
given by, 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts|u1D461Cst|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a dampers and springs in 
series.  We characterize this in the input by shear  moduli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6, and decay constants,  |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.  
The viscoelastic behavior is optional, and an arbit rary number of terms may be used.  In 
order to avoid a constant shear modulus from this v iscoelastic formulation, a term in 
the series is included only when  |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst> 0. 
 
For VFLAG = 1, the viscoelastic term is 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D461Cst
|zeroCst∂|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst |u1D438Cst
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F  
where |u1D7≠∆/u1D458/u1D45∫|u1D438 is the instantaneous stress evaluated from the int ernal energy functional.  The 
coeﬃcients in the Prony series therefore correspond  to normalized relaxation moduli 
instead of elastic moduli. 
 
The Mooney-Rivlin rubber model (model 27) is obtain ed by specifying |u1D4JB = 1 .  In spite of 
the diﬀerences in formulations with Model 27, we ﬁn d that the results obtained with 
this model are nearly identical with those of Mater ial 27 as long as large values of 
Poisson’s ratio are used. 
 
The frequency independent damping is obtained by th e having a spring and slider in 
series as shown in the following sketch:

it is reset to that value and the deviatoric stress  state is eliminated. 
 
If the load curve ID (LCYP) is provided as a positi ve number, the deviatoric, perfectly 
plastic, pressure dependent, yield function, /u1D̅1∫, is given as 
/u1D̅1∫=/radical.v13/u1D4:D|twoCst− |u1D439|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1 = |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst− |u1D439|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1 
where,  |u1D439|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1  is a tabulated function of yield stress as a funct ion of pressure, and the 
second invariant, /u1D4:D|twoCst, is deﬁned in terms of the deviatoric stress tenso r as: 
/u1D4:D|twoCst=1
2|u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   . 
If LCYP is negative, then the yield function become s: 
/u1D̅1∫=/u1D4:D|twoCst− |u1D439|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1  . 
 
If cracking is invoked by setting the residual stre ngth factor, B, on Card 2 to a value 
between 0.0 and 1.0, the yield stress is multiplied  by a factor |u1D4J3 which reduces with 
plastic strain according to a trilinear law as show n in Figure M78-1 .

|u1D7≠≠|oneCst and |u1D7≠≠|twoCst are tabulated functions of pressure that are deﬁne d by load curves, see Figure 
M78-2 .  The values on the curves are strain as a functio n of pressure and should be 
entered in order of increasing pressure.  The strai n values should always increase 
monotonically with pressure. 
 
By properly deﬁning the load curves, it is possible  to obtain the desired strength and

|u1D43A|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1 =|u1D43A|zeroCst|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD − |u1D4JD|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D44FCst
|parenleftCv1|u1D4JDref − |u1D4JD|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D44FCst 
|u1D43∆|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1 =|u1D43∆|zeroCst|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD − |u1D4JD|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D44FCst
|parenleftCv1|u1D4JDref − |u1D4JD|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D44FCst 
In the above |u1D43∆|zeroCst is an input value, |u1D4JD is the current pressure, |u1D4JD|zeroCst is the cut-oﬀ or datum 
pressure (must be zero or negative), and |u1D43A|zeroCst is the initial shear modulus at small shear 
strain: 
|u1D43A|zeroCst= SFLC ×/u1D̅0F|oneCst
|u1D6F∆|oneCst  . 
In the above (/u1D̅0F|oneCst, |u1D6F∆|oneCst) is the ﬁrst (nonzero) point in LCID. Therefore, |u1D43A|zeroCst represents the 
total of the elastic slopes of all the layers. 
 
If |u1D4JD falls below |u1D4JD|zeroCst (meaning becomes more tensile), the shear stresses  are set to zero and 
the pressure is set to |u1D4JD|zeroCst.  Thus, the material has no stiﬀness or strength i n tension.  The 
pressure in compression is calculated as follows: 
|u1D4JD = |u1D4JD/r.st|eCst /f.st|<racketleftCvJ−|u1D43∆|zeroCst
|u1D4JD/r.st|eCst /f.stln(|u1D449) |<racketriµhtCvJ|oneCst(|oneCst−|u1D44FCst)/fraction.v2
 
where |u1D449 is the relative volume, that is, the ratio between  the original and current 
volume.  This formula results in an instantaneous b ulk modulus that is proportional to 
|u1D4JD|u1D44FCst whose value at the reference pressure is equal to |u1D43∆|zeroCst(1 − |u1D44F) ⁄ . 
 
The stress-strain pairs deﬁne a shear stress as a f unction of shear strain curve.  The ﬁrst 
point on the curve is assumed by default to be (0,0)  and does not need to be entered.  
The slope of the curve must decrease with increasin g |u1D6F∆.  This curve applies at the

The constants |u1D44∆|zeroCst, |u1D44∆|oneCst, and |u1D44∆|twoCst govern the pressure sensitivity of the yield stres s.  Only the 
ratios between these values are important - the abs olute stress values are taken from the 
stress-strain curve.  The shear stress-strain curve  (with points (/u1D̅0F|oneCst, |u1D6F∆|oneCst), 
(/u1D̅0F|twoCst, |u1D6F∆|twoCst),…,  (/u1D̅0F|u1D441Cst, |u1D6F∆|u1D441Cst)) is converted into a series of /u1D441 elastic perfectly plastic curves such 
that ∑|parenleftCv2/u1D̅0F|u1D4J6,(|u1D6F∆)|parenriµhtCv2=/u1D̅0F(|u1D6F∆), as shown in Figure M79-1 .  
 
 
 
Each elastic perfectly plastic curve represents one  “layer” in the material model.  
Deviatoric stresses are stored and calculated separ ately for each layer.  The total 
deviatoric stress is the sum of the deviatoric stre sses in each layer.  By this method, 
hysteretic (energy-absorbing) stress-strain curves are generated in response to any 
strain cycle of amplitude greater than the lowest y ield strain of any layer.  The example 
below ( Figure M79-2 ) shows response to small and large strain cycles s uperposed on 
the input curve (thick line labeled backbone curve) . 
Deﬁnition of shear strain and shear stress: 
Diﬀerent deﬁnitions of “shear strain” and “shear st ress” are possible when applied to 
three-dimensional stress states.  MAT_079 uses the following deﬁnitions: 
• Input shear stress is treated by the material mod el as, Figure M79-1.  Family of stress- strain curves.  The curve labeled total 
represents LCID × SFLC. The other curves represent one “layer” in the 
material model.

For a particular stress or strain state (deﬁned by the relationship between the three 
principal stresses or strains), a scaling factor ma y be needed in order to convert between 
the deﬁnitions given above and the shear stress or strain that an engineer would expect.  
The MAT_079 deﬁnitions of shear stress and shear st rain are derived from triaxial 
testing in which one principal stress is applied, w hile the other two principal stresses 
are equal to a conﬁning stress which is held consta nt, meaning principal stresses and 
strains have the form (|u1D44∆, |u1D44F, |u1D44F) . If instead the user wishes the input curve to rep resent a 
test in which a pure shear strain is applied over a  hydrostatic pressure, such as a shear-
box text, then we recommend scaling both the |u1D46J-axis and the |u1D466-axis of the curve by 
0.866. This factor assumes principal stresses of th e form |parenleftCv1|u1D4JD + |u1D461, |u1D4JD − |u1D461, |u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv1  where |u1D461 is the 
applied shear stress, and similarly for the princip al strains. 
Pressure Sensitivity: 
The yield stresses of the layers, and hence the str ess at each point on the shear stress-
strain input curve, vary with pressure according to  constants A0, A1 and A2. The elastic 
moduli, and hence also the slope of each section of  shear stress-strain curve, vary with 
pressure according to constant B. These eﬀects comb ine to modify the shear stress-strain 
curve according to pressure as shown in Figure M79-3 .

 Pressure sensitivity can make the solution sensitiv e to numerical noise.  In cases where 
the expected pressure changes are small compared to  the initial stress state, using 
pressure from the initial stress state instead of c urrent pressure as the basis for the 
pressure sensitivity (option PINIT) may be preferab le.  This causes the bulk modulus 
and shear stress-strain curve to be calculated once  for each element at the start of the 
analysis and to remain ﬁxed thereafter.  Positive s ettings of PINIT aﬀect both stiﬀness 
scaling (calculated using B) and strength scaling ( calculated using A0, A1 and A2).  If 
PINIT options 2 (“plane stress” pressure) or 3 (ver tical stress) are used, these quantities 
substitute for pressure |u1D4JD in the equations above.  Input values of |u1D4JDref  and |u1D4JD|zeroCst should then 
also be “plane stress” pressure or vertical stress,  respectively.  Negative settings of 
PINIT have these eﬀects only on stiﬀness scaling (B ), while the strength scaling is 
calculated from the current pressure as for PINIT =  0.   
 
If PINIT is used, B is allowed to be as high as 1.0  (stiﬀness proportional to initial 
pressure); otherwise, values of B higher than about  0.5 are not recommended. 
Dilatancy: 
Parameters DIL_A, DIL_B, DIL_C and DIL_D control th e compaction and dilatancy that 
occur in sandy soils as a result of shearing motion .  If this facility is used together with 
pore water pressure (see *CONTROL_PORE_FLUID), liqu efaction can be modeled.  
However, note that the compaction/dilatancy algorit hm used in this material model is 
very unsophisticated compared to recently published  research ﬁndings.

Strain rate sensitivity: 
Strain rate eﬀect is accounted for by scaling the y ield stress of each layer as the user-
speciﬁed strain rate eﬀect is accounted for by scal ing the yield stress of each layer as the 
user-speciﬁed function of plastic strain rate.  The  stress-strain curve deﬁned by LCID is 
for quasi-static loading.  Scale factor (on the |u1D466-axis) as a function of strain rate (on the |u1D46J-
axis) is deﬁned in curve LCSR. All scale factors mu st be equal to or larger than 1.0.  
Because the rate enhancement factor applies to the strength but not the stiﬀness, and is 
calculated separately for each layer, an overall en hancement factor between 1.0 and the 
value in LSCR will be observed in situations where not all the layers are yielding.  
Cyclic degradation: 
Cyclic degradation is accounted for by reducing the  size of all yield surfaces 
proportionally based on the accumulation of the dam age strain.  The strength reduction 
factor, |u1D4J3, is determined by the following equation: 
|u1D4J3 = 1 − (1 −Σ|u1D44JCst) |parenleftCv61 − |u1D4J2−/u1D̅12.st/u1D6FE.st/u1D451.sts
|oneCst−/Sig⋯a.st/u1D44⃡.sts|parenriµhtCv6 
where Σ is the shear stress ratio (deﬁned as current shear  stress divided by shear 
strength at the current pressure); Σ|u1D44JCst is the residual shear strength ratio SIGR; /u1Dℜ12 is the 
input parameter CHI; and |u1D6F∆/u1D451.st is the damage strain, deﬁned as the summation of *MAT_079  *MAT_HYSTERETIC_SOIL  
 absolute incremental changes in Von Mises strain th at accumulate whenever the 
threshold shear stress ratio SIGTH is exceeded. *MAT_RAMBERG-OSGOOD  *MAT_080

The Ramberg-Osgood equation is an empirical constit utive relation to represent the

The Ramberg-Osgood equations are inherently one-dim ensional and are assumed to 
apply to shear components.  To generalize this theo ry to the multidimensional case, it is 
assumed that each component of the deviatoric stres s and deviatoric tensorial strain is 
independently related by the one-dimensional stress -strain equations.  A projection is 
used to map the result back into deviatoric stress space if required.  The volumetric 
behavior is elastic, and, therefore, the pressure p  is found by 
|u1D4JD = −|u1D43∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst 
where |u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst is the volumetric strain. *MAT_PLASTICITY_WITH_DAMAGE  *MAT_081-082  
 *MAT_PLASTICITY_WITH_DAMAGE _{OPTION}  
This manual entry applies to both types 81 and 82.  Materials 81 and 82 model an elas to-
visco-plastic material with user-deﬁned isotropic stress versus strain curves, which, 
themselves, may be strain-rate dependent.  This mod el accounts for the eﬀects of 
damage prior to rupture based on an eﬀective plasti c-strain measure.  Additionally, 
failure can be triggered when the time step drops b elow some speciﬁed value.  Adding 
an orthotropic damage option will invoke material t ype 82.  Since type 82 must track 
directional strains it is, computationally, more ex pensive.

*MAT_PLASTICITY_WITH_DAMAGE_STOCHASTIC or *MAT_081_ STOCHASTIC 
The ORTHO option invokes an orthotropic damage mode l, an extension that was ﬁrst 
added as for modelling failure in aluminum panels.  Directional damage begins after a 
deﬁned failure strain is reached in tension and con tinues to evolve until a tensile 
rupture strain is reached in either one of the two orthogonal directions.  After rupture is 
detected at all  integration points, the element is deleted.   
The ORTHO_RCDC option invokes the damage model deve loped by Wilkins [Wilkins, 
et al.  1977].  The ORTHO_RCDC1980 option invokes a  damage model based on strain 
invariants as developed by Wilkins [Wilkins, et al.   1980].  A nonlocal formulation, 
which requires additional storage, is used if a cha racteristic length is deﬁned.  The 
RCDC option, which was added at the request of Toyo ta, works well in predicting 
failure in cast aluminum; see Yamasaki, et al., [20 06].

Remarks: 
1.  The stress strain behavior may be treated by a bil inear stress strain curve by 
deﬁning the tangent modulus, ETAN.  Alternately, a curve similar to that 
shown in Figure M24-1  is expected to be deﬁned by (EPS1, ES1) - (EPS8, E S8); 
however, an eﬀective stress versus eﬀective plastic  strain curve (LCSS) may be 
input instead if eight points are insuﬃcient.  The cost is roughly the same for 
either approach.  The most general approach is to u se the table deﬁnition (LC-
SS) discussed below. 
Three options to account for strain rate eﬀects are  possible: 
a)  Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model 
which scales the yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|sixCst/fraction.v2
 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate, |u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
If the viscoplastic option is active, VP = 1.0, and  if SIGY is > 0, then the 
dynamic yield stress is computed from the sum of th e static stress, 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2, which is typically given by a load curve ID, and the initial yield 
stress, SIGY, multiplied by the Cowper-Symonds rate  term as follows: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 + SIG Y × |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst
|u1D436|parenriµhtCv6|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  , 
where the plastic strain rate is used.  With this l atter approach similar re- 
sults can be obtained between this model and materi al model: *MAT_-
ANISOTROPIC_VISCOPLASTIC.  If SIGY = 0, the followi ng equation is *MAT_081-082  *MAT_PLASTICITY_WITH_DAMAGE  
 used instead where the static stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2, must be deﬁned by a load 
curve: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2
⎣⎢⎢⎡1 + |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst
|u1D436|parenriµhtCv6|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
⎦⎥⎥⎤ 
This latter equation is always used if the viscopla stic option is oﬀ. 
b)  For complete generality a load curve (LCSR) to sca le the yield stress may 
be input instead.  In this curve the scale factor a s a function of strain rate is 
deﬁned. 
c)  If diﬀerent stress as a function of strain curves can be provided for various 
strain rates, a table (LCSS) can be used.  Then the  table input in 
*DEFINE_TABLE is expected; see Figure M24-1 . 
2.  Damage.  The constitutive properties for the damaged materi al are obtained 
from the undamaged material properties.  The amount  of damage is represent- 
ed |u1D714 which varies from zero if no damage has occurred t o unity for complete 
rupture.  For uniaxial loading, the nominal stress in the damaged material is 
given by  
|u1D7≠∆nominal =|u1D443

 where |u1D443 is the applied load and |u1D434 is the surface area.  The true stress is given 
by:  
|u1D7≠∆true =|u1D443
|u1D434 − |u1D434loss  
where |u1D434loss  is the void area.  The damage variable can then be  deﬁned: 
|u1D714 =|u1D434loss 
|u1D434 
such that 
0 ≤ |u1D714 ≤ 1. 
In this model, unless LCDM is deﬁned, damage is deﬁ ned in terms of eﬀective 
plastic strain after the failure strain is exceeded  as follows: 
|u1D714 =|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst− |u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠rupture |u1D4JDCst− |u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCst , |u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCst≤ |u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst≤ |u1D7≠≠rupture |u1D4JDCst 
After exceeding the failure strain, softening begin s and continues until the rup- 
ture strain is reached. 
3.  Rc-Dc Model.  The damage, |u1D437, for the Rc-Dc model is given by: 
|u1D437 =/integral.v:|u1D714|oneCst|u1D714|twoCst|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst 
where |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain,  
|u1D714|oneCst= |parenleftCvJ1

is a triaxial stress weighting term and

 is an asymmetric strain weighting term.  In the abo ve |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JACst is the mean stress.  
For |u1D434/u1D4:̅.st we use  
|u1D434/u1D4:̅.st= min |parenleftCvJ |dividesCvJ|u1D7≠∆|twoCst
|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|dividesCvJ,|dividesCvJ|u1D7≠∆|threeCst
|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|dividesCvJ|parenriµhtCvJ  , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst are the principal stresses and |u1D7≠∆|oneCst> |u1D7≠∆|twoCst> |u1D7≠∆|threeCst.  Fracture is initiated when 
the accumulation of damage is 
|u1D437
|u1D437|u1D4J≠Cst> 1  , 
where |u1D437|u1D4J≠Cst is the critical damage given by 
|u1D437|u1D4J≠Cst= |u1D437|zeroCst|parenleftCv21 + |u1D44F|∇|u1D437||u1D7≠6Cst|parenriµhtCv2  . 
A fracture fraction,  
|u1D439 =|u1D437 − |u1D437|u1D4J≠Cst
|u1D437|u1D46≠Cst  , 
deﬁnes the degradations of the material by the Rc-D c model. 
For the Rc-Dc model the gradient of damage needs to  be estimated.  The dam- 
age is connected to the integration points, and, th us, the computation of the 
gradient requires some manipulation of the LS-DYNA source code.  Provided 
that the damage is connected to nodes, it can be se en as a standard bilinear 
ﬁeld and the gradient is easily obtained.  To enabl e this, the damage at the in- 
tegration points are transferred to the nodes as fo llows.  Let |u1D438|u1D4JBCst be the set of 
elements sharing node |u1D4JB, ||u1D438|u1D4JBCst| be the number of elements in that set, |u1D443|u1D4J2Cst be the 
set of integration points in element |u1D4J2 and |dividesCv1|u1D443|u1D4J2Cst|dividesCv1 be the number of points in that 
set.  The average damage |u1D437/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D4J2Cst in element |u1D4J2 is computed as  
|u1D437/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D4J2Cst=∑ |u1D437|u1D4JDCst |u1D4JDCst∈|u1D443Cst|u1D4J2Csts
|dividesCv1|u1D443|u1D4J2Cst|dividesCv1 
where |u1D437|u1D4JDCst is the damage in integration point |u1D4JD. Finally, the damage value in 
node |u1D4JB is estimated as 
|u1D437|u1D4JBCst=∑ |u1D437/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D4J2Cst |u1D4J2Cst∈|u1D438Cst/u1D45B.sts
||u1D438|u1D4JBCst|. 
This computation is performed in each time step and  requires additional stor- 
age.  Currently we use three times the total number  of nodes in the model for 
this calculation, but this could be reduced by a co nsiderable factor if necessary.   
 
There is an Rc-Dc option for the Gurson dilatationa l-plastic model.  In the im- 
plementation of this model, the norm of the gradien t is computed diﬀerently.  
Let |u1D438/u1D45:.st|u1D4J9Cst be the set of elements from within a distance /u1D45∫ of element, |u1D4J3, not includ- *MAT_PLASTICITY_WITH_DAMAGE  *MAT_081-082  
 ing the element itself, and let /divides.v:|u1D438/u1D45:.st|u1D4J9Cst/divides.v: be the number of elements in that set.  The 
norm of the gradient of damage is estimated roughly  as 
‖∇|u1D437‖/u1D45:.st≈1
/divides.v:|u1D438/u1D45:.st|u1D4J9Cst/divides.v:|summationCv1|dividesCv2|u1D437|u1D4J2Cst− |u1D437/u1D45:.st|dividesCv2
|u1D4J1|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45:.st|u1D4J2Cst∈|u1D438Cst/u1D45:.sts/u1D4⃡9.sts 
where |u1D4J1|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45:.st is the distance between element |u1D4J3 and |u1D4J2. 
The reason for taking the ﬁrst approach is that it should be a better approxima- 
tion of the gradient; it can for one integration po int in each element be seen as a 
weak gradient of an elementwise constant ﬁeld.  The  memory consumption as 
well as computational work should not be much highe r than for the other ap- 
proach. 
The RCDC1980 model is identical to the RCDC model e xcept the expression for 
|u1D434/u1D4:̅.stis in terms of the principal stress deviators and t akes the form 
|u1D434/u1D4:̅.st= max |parenleftCvJ |dividesCvJ|u1D446|twoCst

Rate eﬀects can be modeled in low and medium densit y foams; see Figure M83-1 .  
Hysteretic unloading behavior in this model is a fu nction of the rate sensitivity with the 
most rate sensitive foams providing the largest hys teresis and vice versa.  The uniﬁed 
constitutive equations for foam materials by Chang [1995] provide the basis for this 
model.  The mathematical description given below is  excerpted from the reference.  
Further improvements have been incorporated based o n work by Hirth, Du Bois, and 
Weimar [1998].  Their improvements permit: load cur ves generated from a drop tower 
test to be directly input, a choice of principal or  volumetric strain rates, load curves to 
be deﬁned in tension, and the volumetric behavior t o be speciﬁed by a load curve.

 allow the Mullin’s eﬀect to be modeled, meaning aft er the ﬁrst loading and unloading, 
further reloading occurs on the unloading curve.  I f it is desired to reload on the loading 
curves with the new generalized unloading, the DAMA GE_DECAY option is available 
which allows the reloading to quickly return to the  loading curve as the damage 
parameter decays back to zero in tension and compre ssion.

Material Formulation: 
The strain is divided into two parts: a linear part  and a non-linear part of the strain  
/u1D404(|u1D461) =/u1D404|u1D43FCst(|u1D461) +/u1D404|u1D441Cst(|u1D461)  , 
and the strain rate becomes 
/u1D404̇(|u1D461) =/u1D404̇|u1D43FCst(|u1D461) +/u1D404̇|u1D441Cst(|u1D461)  , 
where /u1D404̇|u1D441Cst is an expression for the past history of /u1D404|u1D441Cst.  A postulated constitutive equation 
may be written as: 
/u1D6D4(|u1D461) =/integral.v:/˙racketleft.v2/u1D404|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst(/u1D̅0F),/u1D412(|u1D461)/˙racketright.v2∞
/u1D̅0F.st=|zeroCst|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F   , 
where /u1D412(|u1D461) is the state variable and ∫∞
/period.st/u1D̅0F.st=|zeroCstis a functional of all values of /u1D̅0F in |u1D447/u1D̅0F.st:0 ≤/u1D̅0F≤
∞ and  
/u1D404|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst(/u1D̅0F) =/u1D404|u1D441Cst(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)  , 
where /u1D̅0F is the history parameter:  
/u1D404|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst(/u1D̅0F=∞)⇔the v irgin material  . 
 
It is assumed that the material remembers only its immediate past, that is, a 
neighborhood about /u1D̅0F= 0.  Therefore, an expansion of /u1D404|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst(/u1D̅0F) in a Taylor series about 
/u1D̅0F= 0 yields: 
 
/u1D404|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst(/u1D̅0F) =/u1D404|u1D441Cst(0) +∂/u1D404|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
∂|u1D461(0)|u1D4J1|u1D461  . 
Hence, the postulated constitutive equation becomes : 
/u1D6D4(|u1D461) =/u1D6D4∗/˙racketleft.v2/u1D404|u1D441Cst(|u1D461),/u1D404̇|u1D441Cst(|u1D461),/u1D412(|u1D461)/˙racketright.v2  , 
where we have replaced |partialdiffCst/u1D404/u1D461.sts|u1D441Csts
|partialdiffCst|u1D461Cst by /u1D404̇|u1D441Cst, and /u1D6D4∗ is a function of its arguments. 
 
For a special case, 
/u1D6D4(|u1D461) =/u1D6D4∗|parenleftCv4/u1D404|u1D441Cst(|u1D461),/u1D412(|u1D461)|parenriµhtCv4  , *MAT_083  *MAT_FU_CHANG_FOAM  
 we may write 
/u1D404̇|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst= |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv1/u1D412(|u1D461),/u1D42C(|u1D461)|parenriµhtCv1 
which states that the nonlinear strain rate is the function of stress and a state variable 
which represents the history of loading.  Therefore , the proposed kinetic equation for 
foam materials is: 
/u1D404̇|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst=/u1D6D4

/˙raceright.v6  , 
where |u1D437|zeroCst, /u1D450|zeroCst, and |u1D4JB|zeroCst are material constants, and /u1D412 is the overall state variable.  If either 
|u1D437|zeroCst= 0 or /u1D450|zeroCst→∞  then the nonlinear strain rate vanishes.

In the implementation by Fu Chang the model was sim pliﬁed such that the input 
constants |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  and the state variables |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  are scalars. 
Additional Remarks: 
1.  Bulk Viscosity.   The bulk viscosity, which generates a rate depend ent 
pressure, may cause an unexpected volumetric respon se.  Consequently, it is 
optional with this model. 
2.  Constant Velocity Loading.   Dynamic compression tests at the strain rates of 
interest in vehicle crash are usually performed wit h a drop tower.  In this test 
the loading velocity is nearly constant but the tru e strain rate, which depends 
on the instantaneous specimen thickness, is not.  T herefore, the engineering 
strain rate input is optional so that the stress-st rain curves obtained at constant 
velocity loading can be used directly.  See the SFL AG ﬁeld. 
3.  Strain Rates with Multiaxial Loading .  To further improve the response 
under multiaxial loading, the strain rate parameter  can either be based on the 
principal strain rates or the volumetric strain rat e.  See the RFLAG ﬁeld. *MAT_FU_CHANG_FOAM  *MAT_083  
 4.  Triaxial Loading.   Correlation under triaxial loading is achieved by  directly 
inputting the results of hydrostatic testing in add ition to the uniaxial data.  
Without this additional information which is fully optional, triaxial response 
tends to be underestimated.  See the PVID ﬁeld. 
5.  Strain Rate Averaging.   Three diﬀerent options are available.  The defaul t, 
SRAF = 0.0, uses a weighted running average with a weight of 1/12  on the 
current strain rate.  With the second option, SRAF = 1.0, the last twelve strain 
rates are averaged.  The third option, SRAF < 0, us es an exponential moving 
average with factor |SRAF|  representing the degree of weighting decrease 
(−1 ≤ SRAF < 0 ). The averaged strain rate at time |u1D461|u1D4JBCst is obtained by: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst|aCst|vCst|eCst /r.st|aCst /g.st |eCst /d.st = |SRAF||u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst+ (1 − |SRAF|)|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst|aCst|vCst|eCst /r.st|aCst /g.st |eCst /d.st  
6.  Unloading Response Options.   Several options are available to control the 
unloading response for MAT_083: 
a)  HU = 0 and TBID > 0.   See Figure M83-2 . 
This is the old way.  In this case the unloading re sponse will follow the 
curve with the lowest strain rate and is rate-indep endent.  The curve with 
lowest strain rate value (typically zero) in TBID s hould correspond to the 
unloading path of the material as measured in a qua sistatic test.  The qua- 
sistatic loading path then corresponds to a realist ic (small) value of the 
strain rate. 
b)  HU = 0 and TBID < 0.  See Figure M83-3 . Current State
Nominal StrainNominal Stressε1ε2ε3
ε0ε3ε2ε1 >> >ε0
 Figure M83-3.   HU = 0, TBID < 0 *MAT_083  *MAT_FU_CHANG_FOAM  
 In this case the curve with lowest strain rate valu e (typically zero) in TBID 
must correspond to the unloading path of the materi al as measured in a 
quasistatic test.  The quasistatic loading path the n corresponds to a realis- 
tic (small) value of the strain rate.  At least thr ee curves should be used in 
the table: one for unloading, one for quasistatic, and one or more for dy- 
namic response.  The quasistatic loading and unload ing path (thus the 
ﬁrst two curves of the table) should form a closed loop.  The unloading re- 
sponse is given by a damage formulation for the pri ncipal stresses as fol- 
lows: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst= (1 − |u1D4J1)|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst 
The damage parameter, |u1D4J1, is computed internally in such a way that the 
unloading path under uniaxial tension and compressi on is ﬁtted exactly in 
the simulation.  The unloading response is rate dep endent in this case.  In 
some cases, this rate dependence for loading and  unloading can lead to 
noisy results.  To reduce that noise, it is possibl e to switch to rate inde- 
pendent unloading with RIULD = 1. 
c)  HU > 0 and TBID > 0.   See Figure M83-4 . 
No unloading curve should be provided in the table and the curve with 
the lowest strain rate value in TBID should corresp ond to the loading path 
of the material as measured in a quasistatic test.  At least two curves 
should be used in the table: one for quasistatic an d one or more for dy- 
namic response.  In this case the unloading respons e is given by a damage 
formulation for the principal stresses as follows: Current State
Nominal StrainNominal Stressε1ε2ε3
ε0ε3ε2ε1 >> >ε0

internally based on HU and SHAPE

where /u1D44A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D462Cst|u1D4JFCst  corresponds to the current value of the hyperelast ic energy 
per unit undeformed volume.  The unloading response  is rate dependent 
in this case.  In some cases, this rate dependence for loading and  unloading 
can lead to noisy results.  To reduce that noise, i t is possible to switch to 
rate independent unloading with RIULD = 1. 
The LOG_LOG_INTERPOLATION  option uses log-log interpolation for 
table TBID in the strain rate direction. *MAT_084  *MAT_WINFRITH_CONCRETE  
 *MAT_WINFRITH_CONCRETE  
This is Material Type 84 with optional rate eﬀects.   The Winfrith concrete model is a 
smeared crack (sometimes known as pseudo crack), sm eared rebar model, implemented 
in the 8-node single integration point continuum el ement, that is, ELFORM = 1 in *SEC-
TION_SOLID.  It is recommended that a double precis ion executable be used when 
using this material model.  Single precision may pr oduce unstable results. 
This model was developed by Broadhouse and Neilson [1987] and Broadhouse [1995] 
over many years and has been validated against expe riments.  The input documenta- 
tion given here is taken directly from the report b y Broadhouse.  The Fortran 
subroutines and quality assurance test problems wer e also provided to LSTC by the 
Winfrith Technology Center.

The Winfrith concrete model can generate an additio nal binary output database 
containing information on crack locations, directio ns, and widths.  In order to generate 
the crack database, the LS-DYNA execution line is m odiﬁed by adding: 
q= crf  
where crf  is the desired name of the crack database, such as  q= d3crack . 
 
LS-PrePost can display the cracks on the deformed m esh plots.  To do so, read the 
d3plot  database into LS-PrePost and then select File  → Open  → Crack  from the top menu 
bar.  Or, open the crack database by adding the fol lowing to the LS-PrePost execution 
line: 
q= crf  
where crf  is the name of the crack database. 
 
By default, all the cracks in visible elements are shown.  You can eliminate narrow 
cracks from the display by setting a minimum crack width for displayed cracks.  Do this 
by choosing Settings  → Post Settings  → Concrete Crack Width .  From the top menu bar of *MAT_084  *MAT_WINFRITH_CONCRETE  
 LS-PrePost, choosing Misc  → Model Info  will reveal the number of cracked elements and 
the maximum crack width in a given plot state.  
 
An ASCII aea_crack  output ﬁle is written if the command *DATABASE_BIN ARY_-
D3CRACK command is included in the input deck.  Thi s command does not have any 
bearing on the aforementioned binary crack database . *MAT_WINFRITH_CONCRETE_REINFORCEMENT  *MAT_084_REINF

In order to prevent volumetric work from contributi ng to the hydrostatic work the ﬁrst 
and second invariants are modiﬁed as shown.  This p rocedure is described in more 
detail by Sussman and Bathe [1987]. 
 
The eﬀects of conﬁned air pressure in its overall r esponse characteristics is included by 
augmenting the stress state within the element by t he air pressure, that is, 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D46≠Cst|u1D4J8Cst − |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠∆air   , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D46≠Cst|u1D4J8Cst  is the bulk skeletal stress and |u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JFCst  is the air pressure.  |u1D7≠∆air  is computed from: 
|u1D7≠∆air = −|u1D4JD|zeroCst|u1D6F∆
1 + |u1D6F∆ −/u1D̅1∫  , 
where |u1D4JD|zeroCst is the initial foam pressure usually taken as the atmospheric pressure and |u1D6F∆ 
deﬁnes the volumetric strain.  The volumetric is fo und with 
|u1D6F∆ = |u1D449 − 1 + |u1D6F∆|zeroCst  , 
where |u1D449 is the relative volume of the voids and |u1D6F∆|zeroCst is the initial volumetric strain which 
is typically zero.  The rubber skeletal material is  assumed to be incompressible. 
 
Rate eﬀects are taken into account through linear v iscoelasticity by a convolution 
integral of the form: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4 |u1D4J6Csts /u1D45̅.sts|u1D4J8Csts /u1D4⃡9.sts(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst

or in terms of the second Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress, |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , and Green's strain tensor, |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst ,

∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst  , 
where |u1D4J4 |u1D4J6Csts /u1D45̅.sts|u1D4J8Csts /u1D4⃡9.sts(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) and |u1D43A |u1D4J6Csts /u1D45̅.sts|u1D4J8Csts /u1D4⃡9.sts(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)are the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent stres s 
measures.  This stress is added to the stress tenso r determined from the strain energy 
functional. 
 *MAT_CELLULAR_RUBBER  *MAT_087  
 Since we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, t he relaxation function is represented 
by one term from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
given by, 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D438/u1D451.st|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|oneCsts|u1D461Cst. 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a damper and spring in 
series.  We characterize this in the input by a she ar modulus, |u1D43A, and decay constant, |u1D6FD|oneCst. 
 
The Mooney-Rivlin rubber model (model 27) is obtain ed by specifying N = 1 without 
air pressure and viscosity.  In spite of the diﬀere nces in formulations with Model 27, we 
ﬁnd that the results obtained with this model are n early identical with those of material 
type 27 as long as large values of Poisson’s ratio are used. *MAT_088  *MAT_MTS  
 *MAT_MTS  
This is Material Type 88.  The MTS model is due to Mauldin, Davidson, and Henninger 
[1990] and is available for applications involving large strains, high pressures and strain 
rates.  As described in the foregoing reference, th is model is based on dislocation 
mechanics and provides a better understanding of th e plastic deformation process for 
ductile materials by using an internal state variab le call the mechanical threshold stress.  
This kinematic quantity tracks the evolution of the  material’s microstructure along 
some arbitrary strain, strain rate, and temperature -dependent path using a diﬀerential 
form that balances dislocation generation and recov ery processes.  Given a value for the 
mechanical threshold stress, the ﬂow stress is dete rmined using either a thermal-
activation-controlled or a drag-controlled kinetics  relationship.  An equation-of-state is 
required for solid elements and a bulk modulus must  be deﬁned below for shell 
elements.

This is Material Type 89.  An elasto-plastic materi al with an arbitrary stress as a 
function of strain curve and arbitrary strain rate dependency can be deﬁned.  It is 
intended for applications where the elastic and pla stic sections of the response are not 
as clearly distinguishable as they are for metals.  Rate dependency of failure strain is 
included.  Many polymers show a more brittle respon se at high rates of strain.

LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID 
Load Curve.   When LC SS is a load curve ID, it is taken as 
deﬁning eﬀective stress as a function of total eﬀec tive strain.  
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the stress as a function eﬀect ive strain for 
that rate.   
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   If the ﬁrst  value in the table is 
negative, LS-DYNA assumes that all the table val ues represent 
the natural logarithm of a strain rate.  Since the tables are 
internally discretized to equally space the table v alues, it makes 
good sense from an accuracy standpoint that the tab le values 
represent the natural log of strain rate when the l o west strain rate 
and highest strain rate diﬀer by several orders of magnitude. 
LCSR Load curve ID deﬁning strain rate scaling eﬀect on yield stress.  If 
LC SR is negative, the load curve is evaluated using a  binary 
search for the correct interval for t he strain rate.  The binary 
search is slower than the default incremental searc h, but in cases 
where large changes in the strain rate may occur ov er a single 
time step, it is more robust. 
EFTX Failure ﬂag:

DAMP Stiﬀness-proportional damping ratio.  Typical value s are 10 −|threeCst or 
10 −|fourCst.  If set too high, instabilities can result.

ﬁlter to remove high frequency oscillation from the  strain rates 
before th ey are used in rate eﬀect calculations.  The cut oﬀ  
frequency of the ﬁlter is [(1 - RFAC) / timestep] r ad/sec. 
LCFAIL Load curve ID giving variation of failure strain wi th strain rate.  
The points on the |u1D46J-axis should be natural log of strain rate, wh ile 
the |u1D466-axis should be the true strain to failure.  Typical ly, this is 
measured by a uniaxial tensile test, and the strain  values are 
converted to true strain. 
NUMINT Number of integration points which must fail before  the element 
is deleted.  This option is available for shells on ly. 
LT.0.0: |N U MINT|  is percentage of integration points/layers 
which must fail before shell element fails. 
Remarks: 
1.  *MAT_089 Compared to *MAT_024.   *MAT_089 is the same as *MAT_024 
except for the following points: 
• Load curve lookup for yield stress is based on eq uivalent uniaxial strain, 
not plastic strain (see Remarks 2  and 3). 
• Elastic stiﬀness is initially equal to |u1D438 but will be increased according to the 
slope of the stress-strain curve (see Remark 7 ). 
• Special strain calculation is used for failure an d damage (see Remark 2 ). 
• Failure strain depends on strain rate (see Remark 4 ). 
2.  Strain Calculation for Failure and Damage.   The strain used for failure and 
damage calculation, |u1D7≠≠pm , is based on an approximation of the greatest valu e of 
maximum principal strain encountered during the ana lysis: 
|u1D7≠≠pm = max 
|iCst≤|nCst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D43BCst|u1D4J6Cst+ |u1D7≠≠v m |u1D4J6Cst)  , 
where 
|u1D4JB = current time step index

3.  Yield Stress Load Curves.   When looking up yield stress from the load curve 
LCSS, the |u1D46J-axis value is |u1D7≠≠v m .

|u1D7≠≠|u1D439Cst= LCFAIL(|u1D7≠≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D4JFCst ) 
= Instantanous true strain to failure from loo k -up on the cur v e LCFAIL 
5.  Damage.   A damage approach is used to avoid sudden shocks when the 
failure strain is reached.  Damage begins when the "strain ratio," |u1D44J, reaches 1.0, 
where 
|u1D44J =/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠pm 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D439Cst. 
Damage is complete, and the element fails and is de leted, when |u1D44J = 1.1 .  The 
damage, 
|u1D437 =
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧1.0  |u1D44J < 1.0
10(1.1 − |u1D44J) 1.0 < |u1D44J < 1.1  , 
is a reduction factor applied to all stresses.  For  example, when |u1D44J = 1.05 , then 
|u1D437 = 0.5 . 
6.  Strain Deﬁnitions.   Unlike other LS-DYNA material models, both the in put 
stress-strain curve and the strain to failure are d eﬁned as total true strain, not 
plastic strain.  The input can be deﬁned from uniax ial tensile tests; nominal 
stress and nominal strain from the tests must be co nverted to true stress and 
true strain.  The elastic component of strain must not be subtracted out. 
7.  Elastic Stiffness Scaling.   The stress-strain curve is permitted to have sect ions 
steeper (i.e. stiﬀer) than the elastic modulus.  Wh en these are encountered the 
elastic modulus is increased to prevent spurious en ergy generation.  The elastic 
stiﬀness is scaled by a factor |u1D4J3e, which is calculated as follows: 
|u1D4J3|u1D4J2Cst= max |parenleftCv41.0,|u1D46≠max 
3|u1D43A|parenriµhtCv4 
where 
|u1D43A = initial shear modulus 
|u1D446max = maximum slope of stress-strain cur v e encountered during the analysis 
8.  Precision.   Double precision is recommended when using this m aterial model, 
especially if the strains become high. *MAT_PLASTICITY_POLYMER  *MAT_089  
 9.  Shell Numbering.   Invariant shell numbering is recommended when usi ng 
this material model.  See *CONTROL_ACCURACY. *MAT_090  *MAT_ACOUSTIC  
 *MAT_ACOUSTIC  
This is  Material Type 90.  This model is appropriate for tr acking low pressure stress 
waves in an acoustic media, such as air or water, a nd can be used only with the acoustic 
pressure element formulation.  The acoustic pressur e element requires only one 
unknown per node.  This element is very cost eﬀecti ve.  Optionally, cavitation can be 
allowed.

VISCO  
This is  Material Type 91 ( OPTION = <BLANK>) or Material Type 92 ( OPTION = VIS-
CO).  This material is a transversely isotropic hyp erelastic model for representing 
biological soft tissues, such as ligaments, tendons , and fascia.  The representation 
provides an isotropic Mooney-Rivlin matrix reinforc ed by ﬁbers having a strain energy 
contribution with the qualitative material behavior  of collagen.  The model has a 
viscoelasticity option which activates a six-term P rony series kernel for the relaxation 
function.  In this case, the hyperelastic strain en ergy represents the elastic (long-time) 
response.  See Weiss et al.  [1996] and Puso and We iss [1998] for additional details. 
NOTE:  This material does not support speciﬁcation of a m a- 
terial angle, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst, for each through-thickness integra- 
tion point of a shell.

Material Formulation: 
The overall strain energy, /u1D44A, is "uncoupled" and includes two isotropic deviato ric 
matrix terms, a ﬁber term, |u1D439, and a bulk term: 
/u1D44A= |u1D436|oneCst|parenleftCv2/u1D4:C̃|oneCst− 3|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D436|twoCst|parenleftCv2/u1D4:C̃|twoCst− 3|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D439(|u1D7≠6) +1
2|u1D43∆[ln(/u1D4:D)]|twoCst 
Here, /u1D4:C̃|oneCst and /u1D4:C̃|twoCst are the deviatoric invariants of the right Cauchy deformation tensor, |u1D7≠6 is 
the deviatoric part of the stretch along the curren t ﬁber direction, and /u1D4:D= det /u1D405 is the 
volume ratio.  The material coeﬃcients |u1D436|oneCst and |u1D436|twoCst are the Mooney-Rivlin coeﬃcients, 
while |u1D43∆ is the eﬀective bulk modulus of the material (inpu t parameter XK). 
 
The derivatives of the ﬁber term |u1D439 are deﬁned to capture the behavior of crimped 
collagen.  The ﬁbers are assumed to be unable to re sist compressive loading - thus the 
model is isotropic when |u1D7≠6 < 1.   An exponential function describes the straighteni ng of 
the ﬁbers, while a linear function describes the be havior of the ﬁbers once they are 
straightened past a critical ﬁber stretch level |u1D7≠6 ≥ |u1D7≠6∗ (input parameter XLAM): *MAT_091-092  *MAT_SOFT_TISSUE

Coeﬃcients |u1D436|threeCst, |u1D436|fourCst, and |u1D436|fiveCst must be deﬁned by the user.  |u1D436|sixCst is determined by LS-DYNA 
to ensure stress continuity at |u1D7≠6 = |u1D7≠6∗.  Sample values for the material coeﬃcients |u1D436|oneCst− |u1D436|fiveCst 
and |u1D7≠6∗ for ligament tissue can be found in Quapp and Weis s [1998].  The bulk modulus 
|u1D43∆ should be at least 3 orders of magnitude larger th an |u1D436|oneCst to ensure near-incompressible 
material behavior. 
 
Viscoelasticity is included through a convolution i ntegral representation for the time-
dependent second Piola-Kirchoﬀ stress /u1D412(/u1D402, |u1D461): 
/u1D412(/u1D402, |u1D461) =/u1D412|u1D4J2Cst(/u1D402) +/integral.v:2|u1D43A(|u1D461 − |u1D46≠)|u1D71J /u1D44A

|zeroCst 
Here, /u1D412|u1D4J2Cst is the elastic part of the second Piola-Kirchoﬀ st ress as derived from the strain 
energy, and |u1D43A(|u1D461 − |u1D46≠)  is the reduced relaxation function, represented by  a Prony series: 
|u1D43A(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D446|u1D4J6Cstexp |parenleftCvJ|u1D461
|u1D447|u1D4J6Cst|parenriµhtCvJ|sixCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
 
Puso and Weiss [1998] describe a graphical method t o ﬁt the Prony series coeﬃcients to 
relaxation data that approximates the behavior of t he continuous relaxation function 
proposed by Y-C. Fung, as quasilinear viscoelastici ty. 
Remarks: 
Cards 1 through 4 must be included for both shell a nd brick elements, although for 
shells cards 3 and 4 are ignored and may be blank l ines. 
 
For shell elements, the ﬁber direction lies in the plane of the element.  The local axis is 
deﬁned by a vector between nodes n1 and n2, and the  ﬁber direction may be oﬀset from 
this axis by an angle FANG. 
 
For brick elements, the local coordinate system is deﬁned using the convention 
described previously for *MAT_ORTHOTROPIC_ELASTIC.  The ﬁber direction is 
oriented in the local system using input parameters  LAX, LAY, and LAZ.  By default, 
(LAX,LA Y ,LA Z ) = (1,0,0)  and the ﬁber is aligned with the local |u1D46J-direction. 
 
An optional initial ﬁber stretch can be speciﬁed us ing XLAM0.  The initial stretch is 
applied during the ﬁrst time step.  This creates pr eload in the model as soft tissue *MAT_SOFT_TISSUE  *MAT_091-092  
 contacts and equilibrium is established.  For examp le, a ligament tissue "uncrimping 
strain" of 3% can be represented with initial stret ch value of 1.03. 
 
If the VISCO keyword option is includeed, at least one Prony series term (S1, T1) must 
be deﬁned. *MAT_093  *MAT_ELASTIC_6DOF_SPRING_DISCRETE_BEAM  
 *MAT_ELASTIC_6DOF_SPRING_DISCRETE_BEAM  
This is Material Type 93.  This material model is d eﬁned for simulating the eﬀects of 
nonlinear elastic and nonlinear viscous beams by us ing six springs each acting about 
one of the six local degrees-of-freedom.  The input  consists of part IDs that reference 
material type, *MAT_ELASTIC_SPRING_DISCRETE_BEAM (t ype 74 above).  
Generally, these referenced parts are used only for  the deﬁnition of this material model 
and are not referenced by any elements.  The two no des deﬁning a beam may be 
coincident to give a zero length beam or oﬀset to g ive a ﬁnite length beam.  For ﬁnite 
length discrete beams the absolute value of the var iable SCOOR in the *SECTION_-
BEAM input should be set to a value of 2.0, which c auses the local |u1D4JF-axis to be aligned 
along the two nodes of the beam to give physically correct behavior.  The distance 
between the nodes of a beam should not aﬀect the be havior of this material model.  A 
triad is used to orient the beam for the directiona l springs.

Remarks: 
1.  Force.  To determine the force, a trial force is ﬁrst compu ted as: 
|u1D439|u1D447Cst= |u1D439|u1D4JBCst+ K × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ(∆|u1D461) 
The yield force is taken from the load curve: 
|u1D439/u1D44C.st= |u1D439|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2∆/u1D4:Fplastic |parenriµhtCv2  , 
where /u1D4:Fplastic  is the plastic deﬂection, given by  
∆/u1D4:Fplastic =|u1D439|u1D447Cst− |u1D439/u1D44C.st
|u1D446 + |u1D43∆max    . 
Here |u1D446 is the slope of FLCID and |u1D43∆max  is the maximum elastic stiﬀness: 
|u1D43∆max = max(|u1D43∆, 2 × |u1D446max )  . 
The trial force is, then, checked against the yield  force to determine |u1D439: 
|u1D439 =/˙raceleft.v6|u1D439/u1D44C.st  |u1D4J6|u1D4J3   |u1D439|u1D447Cst> |u1D439/u1D44C.st

The ﬁnal force, which includes rate eﬀects and damp ing, is given by: *MAT_094  *MAT_INELASTIC_SPRING_DISCRETE_BEAM  
 |u1D439|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D439 × |<racketleftCv61 + C1 × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ+ C2 × sgn|parenleftCv1∆/u1D4:Ḟ|parenriµhtCv1ln |parenleftCv6max /˙raceleft.v61. ,|dividesCv2∆/u1D4:Ḟ|dividesCv2

2.  Yield Force Curve.  Unless the origin of the curve starts at (0,0) , the negative 
part of the curve is used when the spring force is negative where the negative 
of the plastic displacement is used to interpolate,  |u1D439|u1D466Cst.  The positive part of the 
curve is used whenever the force is positive.  In t hese equations, ∆/u1D4:F is the 
change in length 
∆/u1D4:F= current  length - initial  length  . 
3.  Cross-Sectional Area.   The cross-sectional area is deﬁned on the section  card 
for the discrete beam elements, See *SECTION_BEAM.  The square root of this 
area is used as the contact thickness oﬀset if thes e elements are included in the 
contact treatment. *MAT_INELASTIC_6DOF_SPRING_DISCRETE_BEAM  *MAT_095

Remarks: 
A full description of the tensile and shear damage parts of this material model is given 
in Govindjee, Kay and Simo [1994,1995].  This model  admits progressive degradation of 
tensile and shear strengths across smeared cracks t hat are initiated under tensile 
loadings.  Compressive failure is governed by a sim plistic J2 ﬂow correction that can be 
disabled if not desired.  Damage is handled by trea ting the rank 4 elastic stiﬀness tensor 
as an evolving internal variable for the material.  Softening induced mesh dependencies 
are handled by a characteristic length method [Oliv er 1989]. 
 
Description of properties: 
1.  |u1D438 is the Young's modulus of the undamaged material a lso known as the virgin 
modulus. 
2.  /u1D̅08 is the Poisson's ratio of the undamaged material a lso known as the virgin 
Poisson's ratio. 
3.  |u1D4J3|u1D4JBCst is the initial principal tensile strength (stress)  of the material.  Once this 
stress has been reached at a point in the body a sm eared crack is initiated there 
with a normal that is co-linear with the 1 st  principal direction.  Once initiated, 
the crack is ﬁxed at that location, though it will convect with the motion of the 
body.  As the loading progresses the allowed tensil e traction normal to the 
crack plane is progressively degraded to a small ma chine dependent constant.  
The degradation is implemented by reducing the mate rial's modulus normal to 
the smeared crack plane according to a maximum diss ipation law that incorpo- 
rates exponential softening.  The restriction on th e normal tractions is given by 
/u1D̅1∫|u1D461Cst= (/u1D42ℜ⊗/u1D42ℜ ):σ− |u1D4J3|u1D4JBCst+ (1 − |u1D7≠≠)|u1D4J3|u1D4JBCst|parenleftCv11 − exp[−/u1D4:B |u1D6F+]|parenriµhtCv1 ≤ 0 
where /u1D42ℜ is the smeared crack normal, |u1D7≠≠ is the small constant, /u1D4:B is the softening 
modulus, and |u1D6F+ is an internal variable.  /u1D4:B is set automatically by the program; 
see |u1D4J4|u1D4J≠Cst below.  |u1D6F+ measures the crack ﬁeld intensity and is output in  the equiva- 
lent plastic strain ﬁeld, |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst, in a normalized fashion. *MAT_BRITTLE_DAMAGE  *MAT_096  
 The evolution of |u1D6F+ is governed by a maximum dissipation argument.  Wh en 
the normalized value reaches unity, the material's strength has been reduced to 
2% of its original value in the normal and parallel  directions to the smeared 
crack.  Note that for plotting purposes it is never  output greater than 5. 
4.  |u1D4J3|u1D46≠Cst is the initial shear traction that may be transmit ted across a smeared crack 
plane.  The shear traction is limited to be less th an or equal to |u1D4J3|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv11 − |u1D6FD|parenriµhtCv1|parenleftCv11 −
exp[−/u1D4:B |u1D6F+]|parenriµhtCv1 through the use of two orthogonal shear damage sur faces.  Note 
that the shear degradation is coupled to the tensil e degradation through the 
internal variable |u1D6F+ which measures the intensity of the crack ﬁeld. |u1D6FD is the 
shear retention factor deﬁned below.  The shear deg radation is taken care of by 
reducing the material's shear stiﬀness parallel to the smeared crack plane. 
5.  |u1D4J4|u1D4J≠Cst is the fracture toughness of the material.  It sho uld be entered as fracture 
energy per unit area crack advance.  Once entered t he softening modulus is 
automatically calculated based on element and crack  geometries.  
6.  |u1D6FD is the shear retention factor.  As the damage prog resses the shear tractions 
allowed across the smeared crack plane asymptote to  the product |u1D6FD|u1D4J3|u1D46≠Cst. 
7.  |u1D7≠2 represents the viscosity of the material.  Viscous  behavior is implemented as 
a simple Perzyna regularization method which allows  for the inclusion of ﬁrst 
order rate eﬀects.  The use of some viscosity is re commend as it serves as regu- 
larizing parameter that increases the stability of calculations. 
8.  |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst is a uniaxial compressive yield stress.  A check o n compressive stresses is 
made using the J2 yield function  
/u1D42C:/u1D42C−/radical.v52
3|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst≤ 0  , 
where /u1D42C is the stress deviator.  If violated, a J2 return mapping correction is 
executed.  This check is executed (1) when no damag e has taken place at an 
integration point yet; (2) when damage has taken pl ace at a point, but the crack 
is currently closed; and (3) during active damage a fter the damage integration 
(i.e. as an operator split).  Note that if the crac k is open the plasticity correction 
is done in the plane-stress subspace of the crack p lane. 
 
A variety of experimental data has been replicated using this model from quasi-static to 
explosive situations.  Reasonable properties for a standard grade concrete would be:

avoid error terminations.

This is Material Type 97.  This model is used to de ﬁne a general joint constraining any 
combination of degrees of freedom between two nodes .  The nodes may belong to rigid 
or deformable bodies.  In most applications the end  nodes of the beam are coincident 
and the local coordinate system ( |u1D4JF, |u1D46≠, |u1D461 axes) is deﬁned by CID (see *SECTION_BEAM).

Remarks: 
1.  Inertia and Stability.   For explicit calculations, the additional stiﬀnes s due to 
this joint may require addition mass and inertia fo r stability.  Mass and rotary 
inertia for this beam element is based on the deﬁne d mass density, the volume, 
and the mass moment of inertia deﬁned in the *SECTI ON_BEAM input. 
2.  Penalty Stiffness.   The penalty stiﬀness applies to explicit calculat ions.  For 
implicit calculations, constraint equations are gen erated and imposed on the 
system equations; therefore, these constants, RPST and RPSR, are not used. *MAT_SIMPLIFIED_JOHNSON_COOK  *MAT_098

STOCHASTIC 
This is  Material Type 98 implementing Johnson/Cook strain s ensitive plasticity.  It is 
used for problems where the strain rates vary over a large range.  In contrast to the full 
Johnson/Cook model (material type 15) this model in troduces the following 
simpliﬁcations: 
1.  thermal eﬀects and damage are ignored, 
2.  and the maximum stress is directly limited since t hermal softening which is 
very signiﬁcant in reducing the yield stress under adiabatic loading is not 
available. 
 
An iterative plane stress update is used for the sh ell elements, but due to the 
simpliﬁcations related to thermal softening and dam age, this model is 50% faster than 
the full Johnson/Cook implementation.  To compensat e for the lack of thermal 
softening, limiting stress values are introduced to  keep the stresses within reasonable 
limits. 
 
A resultant formulation for the Belytschko-Tsay, th e C0 Triangle, and the fully 
integrated type 16 shell elements is available and can be activated by specifying either 
zero or one through thickness integration point on the *SECTION_SHELL card.  While 
less accurate than through thickness integration, t his formulation runs somewhat faster.  
Since the stresses are not computed in the resultan t formulation, the stresses written to 
the databases for the resultant elements are set to  zero. 
 
This model is also available for the Hughes-Liu bea m, the Belytschko-Schwer beam, and 
for the truss element.  For the resultant beam form ulation, the rate eﬀects are 
approximated by the axial rate, since the thickness  of the beam about it bending axes is 
unknown.  Because this model is primarily used for structural analysis, the pressure is 
determined using the linear bulk modulus.

the normalized eﬀective strain rate: 
|u1D7≠≠∗̇=|u1D7≠≠̅̇

The maximum stress is limited by SIGMAX and SIGSAT  by: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= min |<raceleftCv4min |<racketleftCv4|u1D434 + |u1D43J|u1D7≠≠ ̅ |u1D4JDCsts/u1D45B.sts

Failure occurs when the eﬀective plastic strain exc eeds PSFAIL. 
2.  Viscoplastic.   If the viscoplastic option is active (VP = 1.0), the parameters 
SIGMAX and SIGSAT are ignored since these parameter s make convergence of 
the plastic strain iteration loop diﬃcult to achiev e.  The viscoplastic option 
replaces the eﬀective strain rate in the forgoing e quations by the eﬀective plas- 
tic strain rate.  Numerical noise is substantially reduced by the viscoplastic 
formulation. 
3.  STOCHASTIC.  The STOCHASTIC option allows spatially varying yiel d and 
failure behavior.  See *DEFINE_STOCHASTIC_VARIATION  for additional 
information. *MAT_099  *MAT_SIMPLIFIED_JOHNSON_COOK_ORTHOTROPIC_DAMAGE

This is  Material Type 99.  This model, which is implemented  with multiple through 
thickness integration points, is an extension of mo del 98 to include orthotropic damage 
as a means of treating failure in aluminum panels.  Directional damage begins after a 
deﬁned failure strain is reached in tension and con tinues to evolve until a tensile 
rupture strain is reached in either one of the two orthogonal directions.  After rupture is 
detected at NUMINT integration points, the element is deleted.

See the description for the SIMPLIFIED_JOHNSON_COOK  model above. *MAT_100  *MAT_SPOTWELD  
 *MAT_SPOTWELD _{OPTION1}_{OPTION2} 
This is  Material Type 100.  The material model applies to b eam element type 9 and to 
solid element type 1.  The failure models apply to both beam and solid elements. 
In the case of solid elements, if hourglass type 4 is speciﬁed then hourglass type 4 will 
be used; otherwise, hourglass type 6 will be automa tically assigned.  Hourglass type 6 is 
preferred. 
The beam elements, based on the Hughes-Liu beam for mulation, may be placed 
between any two deformable shell surfaces and tied with constraint contact, *CON-
TACT_SPOTWELD, which eliminates the need to have ad jacent nodes at spot weld 
locations.  Beam spot welds may be placed between r igid bodies and rigid/deformable 
bodies by making the node on one end of the spot we ld a rigid body node which can be 
an extra node for the rigid body; see *CONSTRAINED_ EXTRA_NODES_ OPTION .   In 
the same way rigid bodies may also be tied together  with this spot weld option.  This 
weld option should not be used with rigid body swit ching.  The foregoing advice is 
valid if solid element spot welds are used; however , since the solid elements have just 
three degrees-of-freedom at each node, *CONTACT_TIE D_SURFACE_TO_SURFACE 
must be used instead of *CONTACT_SPOTWELD. 
In ﬂat topologies the shell elements have an uncons trained drilling degree-of-freedom 
which prevents torsional forces from being transmit ted.  If the torsional forces are 
deemed to be important, brick elements should be us ed to model the spot welds. 
Beam and solid element force resultants for MAT_SPO TWELD are written to the spot 
weld force ﬁle, swforc , and the ﬁle for element stresses and resultants f or designated 
elements, elout . 
It is advisable to include all spot welds, which pr ovide the slave nodes, and spot welded 
materials, which deﬁne the master segments, within a single *CONTACT_SPOTWELD 
interface for beam element spot welds or a *CONTACT _TIED_SURFACE_TO_SURFACE 
interface for solid element spot welds.   As a constraint method these interfaces are treat ed 
independently which can lead to signiﬁcant problems  if such interfaces share common 
nodal points.  An added beneﬁt is that memory usage  can be substantially less with a 
single interface. 
Available options for OPTION1  include: 
<BLANK> 
DAMAGE-FAILURE 
The DAMAGE-FAILURE option causes one additional lin e to be read with the damage 
parameter and a ﬂag that determines how failure is computed from the resultants.  On 
this line the parameter, RS, if nonzero, invokes da mage mechanics combined with the *MAT_SPOTWELD  *MAT_100  
 plasticity model to achieve a smooth drop oﬀ of the  resultant forces prior to the removal 
of the spot weld.  The parameter OPT determines the  method used in computing 
resultant based failure, which is unrelated to dama ge. 
Available options for OPTION2  include: 
<BLANK> 
UNIAXIAL 
The UNIAXIAL keyword option causes the transverse s tresses and transverse strains to 
be zero for solid spot welds.  The older uniaxial m ethod, invoked with E < 0.0 on 
Card 1, assumed only the transverse stresses are ze ro.  Compared to the older method, 
the UNIAXIAL keyword option increases the stability  of the solver.  See Remark 2  for 
more details.

Remarks: 
1.  Failure Model Overview.  Spot weld material is modeled with isotropic 
hardening plasticity coupled to failure models.  EF AIL speciﬁes a failure strain 
which fails each integration point in the spot weld  independently.  The OPT 
parameter is used to specify a failure criterion th at fails the entire weld element 
when the criterion is met.  Alternatively, EFAIL an d OPT may be used to initi- 
ate damage when the DAMAGE-FAILURE option is active  using RS, BETA, 
and DMGOPT as described below. 
Beam spot weld elements can use any OPT value excep t 7.  Brick spot weld 
elements can use any OPT value except 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 , and -9.  Hex assembly spot 
welds can use any OPT value except 9 and -9. 
For all OPT failure criteria, if a zero is input fo r a failure parameter on Card 2, 
the corresponding term will be omitted from the equ ation.  For example, if for 
OPT = 0, only /u1D441|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JFCst/u1D439.sts is nonzero, the failure surface is reduced to |/u1D441|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JFCst | =/u1D441|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JFCst/u1D439.sts (see 
below). 
Similarly, if the failure strain EFAIL is set to ze ro, the failure strain model is not 
used.  Both EFAIL and OPT failure may be active at the same time. *MAT_SPOTWELD  *MAT_100  
 2.  Loading Solid Welds Uniaxially.   We have implemented two methods of 
loading solid and solid weld assemblies uniaxially.   The older method is in- 
voked by deﬁning the elastic modulus, |u1D438, as a negative number where the ab- 
solute value of |u1D438 is the desired value for |u1D438.  This uniaxial option causes the two 
transverse stress terms to be assumed to be zero th roughout the calculation.  
This assumption eliminates parasitic transverse str ess that causes slow growth 
of plastic strain-based damage.  
The other method is invoked by setting OPTION2  to UNIAXIAL. This method 
is preferred.  It causes the two transverse stress terms and the two transverse 
strains terms to be set to zero.  It was added beca use we found that the older 
method sometimes induced spurious oscillations in t he axial force, leading to 
premature failure.  
The motivation for the uniaxial options can be expl ained with a weld loaded in 
tension.  Due to Poisson’s eﬀect, an element in ten sion would be expected to 
contract in the transverse directions.  However, be cause the weld nodes are 
constrained to the mid-plane of shell elements, suc h contraction is only possi- 
ble to the degree that the shell element contracts.   In other words, the uniaxial 
stress state cannot be represented by the weld.  Fo r plastic strain-based dam- 
age, this eﬀect can be particularly apparent as it causes tensile stress to contin- 
ue to grow very large as the stress state becomes v ery nearly triaxial tension.  
In this stress state, plastic strain grows very slo wly so it appears that damage 
calculation is failing to knock down the stress.  B y simply assuming that the 
transverse stresses are zero, the plastic strain gr ows as expected and damage is 
much more eﬀective. 
3.  NF.   NF speciﬁes the number of terms used to ﬁlter the  stresses or resultants 
used in the OPT failure criterion.  NF cannot excee d 30.  The default value is set 
to zero which is generally recommended unless oscil latory resultant forces are 
observed in the time history databases.  Although w elds should not oscillate 
signiﬁcantly, this option was added for consistency  with the other spot weld 
options.  NF aﬀects the storage since it is necessa ry to store the resultant forces 
as history variables.  The NF parameter is availabl e only for beam element 
welds. 
4.  Time Scaling.   The inertias of the spot welds are scaled during the ﬁrst time 
step so that their stable time step size is ∆|u1D461.  A strong compressive load on the 
spot weld at a later time may reduce the length of the spot weld so that stable 
time step size drops below ∆|u1D461. If the value of ∆|u1D461 is zero, mass scaling is not per- 
formed, and the spot welds will probably limit the time step size.  Under most 
circumstances, the inertias of the spot welds are s mall enough that scaling 
them will have a negligible eﬀect on the structural  response and the use of this 
option is encouraged. *MAT_100  *MAT_SPOTWELD  
 5.  Yield Curve or Table for SIGY.   When using a yield curve or table for SIGY, a 
simpliﬁed plasticity algorithm is used, assuming a linear behavior within one 
time increment.  Thus, no iterative return mapping has to be performed. 
6.  Damage.  When the DAMAGE-FAILURE option is invoked, the cons titutive 
properties for the damaged material are obtained fr om the undamaged materi- 
al properties.  The amount of damage evolved is rep resented by the constant, 
|u1D714, which varies from zero if no damage has occurred to unity for complete 
rupture.  For uniaxial loading, the nominal stress in the damaged material is 
given by  
|u1D7≠∆nominal =|u1D443
|u1D434 
where |u1D443 is the applied load and |u1D434 is the surface area.  The true stress is given 
by:  
|u1D7≠∆true =|u1D443
|u1D434 − |u1D434loss  
where |u1D434loss  is the void area.  The damage variable can then be  deﬁned: 
|u1D714 =|u1D434loss 
|u1D434  , 
where 
0 ≤ |u1D714 ≤ 1  . 
In this model, damage is initiated when the eﬀectiv e plastic strain in the weld 
exceeds the failure strain, EFAIL.  If DMGOPT = 10,  11, or 12, damage will 
initiate when the eﬀective plastic strain exceeds E FAIL, or when the failure 
criterion is met, whichever occurs ﬁrst.  The failu re criterion is speciﬁed by the 
OPT parameter.  If the inputted value of EFAIL = 0 and DMGOPT = 10, 11, or 
12, then damage will only be initiated if the failu re criterion is met.  After dam- 
age initiates, the damage variable is evaluated by one of two ways: 
a)  For DMGOPT = 0, 1, 10, or 11, the damage variable is a function of eﬀec- 
tive plastic strain in the weld: 
|u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCst≤ |u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst≤ |u1D7≠≠rupture |u1D4JDCst⇒|u1D714 =|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst− |u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠rupture |u1D4JDCst− |u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCst   , 
where |u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCst = EFAIL and |u1D7≠≠rupture |u1D4JDCst = RS.  If DMGOPT = 10 or 11, and dam- 
age initiates by the failure criterion, then |u1D7≠≠failure |u1D4JDCstis set equal to the eﬀective 
plastic strain in the weld at the time of damage in itiation. 
b)  For DMGOPT = 2 or 12, the damage variable is a fun ction of time: 
|u1D461failure ≤ |u1D461 ≤ |u1D461rupture ⇒|u1D714 =|u1D461 − |u1D461failure 
|u1D461rupture  *MAT_SPOTWELD  *MAT_100  
 where |u1D461failure  is the time at which damage initiates, and |u1D461rupture = RS .  For 
DMGOPT = 2, |u1D461failure  is set equal to the time at which |u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst exceeds EFAIL.  
For DMGOPT = 12,  |u1D461failure  is set equal to either the time when |u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst exceeds 
EFAIL or the time when the failure criterion is met , whichever occurs ﬁrst. 
If DMGOPT = 0, 1, or 2, inputting EFAIL = 0 will ca use damage to initiate as 
soon as the weld stress reaches the yield surface.  Prior to version 9.1, inputting 
EFAIL = 0 for DMGOPT = 10, 11, 12 would similarly c ause damage to initiate 
when the stress state reaches the yield surface, bu t version 9.1 and later will 
ignore EFAIL = 0 and only initiate damage when the failure criterion is met.  If 
the eﬀective plastic strain is zero when damage ini tiates by the failure criterion, 
then the yield stress of the weld is reduced to the  current eﬀective stress so that 
the stress state is on the yield surface and plasti c strain can start to grow. 
For DMGOPT = 1, the damage behavior is the same as for DMGOPT = 0, but 
an additional damage variable is calculated to prev ent stress growth during 
softening.  Similarly, DMGOPT = 11 behaves like DMG OPT = 10 except for the 
additional damage variable.  This additional functi on is also used with DM-
GOPT = 2 and 12.  The eﬀect of this additional dama ge function is noticed only 
in brick and brick assembly welds in tension loadin g where it prevents growth 
of the tensile force in the weld after damage initi ates.  
For DMGOPT = 10, 11, or 12 an optional FMODE parame ter determines 
whether a weld that reaches the failure surface wil l fail immediately or initiate 
damage.  The failure surface calculation has shear terms, which may include 
the torsional moment as well as normal and bending terms.   If FMODE is in- 
put with a value between 0 and 1, then when the fai lure surface is reached, the 
sum of the square of the shear terms is divided by the sum of the square of all 
terms.  If this ratio exceeds FMODE, then the weld will fail immediately.  If the 
ratio is less than or equal to FMODE, then damage w ill initiate.  The FMODE 
option is available only for brick and brick assemb ly welds.  
For resultant based failure (OPT = -1 or 0) and DMG OPT = 10, 11, or 12 an op- 
tional FFCAP parameter determines whether a weld th at reaches the failure 
surface will fail immediately.  After damage initia tion, the failure function can 
reach values above 1.0. This can now be limited by the FFCAP value (should be 
larger than 1.0):

 For weld elements in an assembly (see RPBHX on *CON TROL_SPOTWELD_-
BEAM or *DEFINE_HEX_SPOTWELD_ASSEMBLY), the failure  criterion is 
evaluated using the assembly cross section.  If dam age is not active, all ele- 
ments will be deleted when the failure criterion is  met.  If damage is active, 
then damage is calculated independently in each ele ment of the assembly.  By 
default, elements of the assembly are deleted as da mage in each element is 
complete.  If ASFF = 1, then failure and deletion o f all elements in the assembly 
will occur simultaneously when damage is complete i n any one of the ele- 
ments. 
8.  TRUE_T.   Weld elements and weld assemblies are tied to the  mid-plane of 
shell materials and so typically have a thickness t hat is half the sum of the 
thicknesses of the welded shell sections.  As a res ult, a weld under shear load- 
ing can be subject to an artiﬁcially large moment w hich will be balanced by 
normal forces transferred through the tied contact.   These normal forces will 
cause the out-of-plane bending moment used in the f ailure calculation to be 
artiﬁcially high.  Inputting a TRUE_T that is small er than the modeled thick- 
ness, for example, 10%-30% of true thickness will s cale down the moment or 
stress that results from the balancing moment and p rovide more realistic fail- 
ure calculations for solid elements and weld assemb lies.  TRUE_T eﬀects only

omitted, the modeled weld element thickness is used .  For OPT = 0 (see below), 
the two out-of-plane moments, |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D46≠Cst  and |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst|u1D461Cst  are replaced by modiﬁed terms

In the above, |u1D461 is the element thickness and  |u1D461true  is the TRUE_T parameter.  For 
OPT = 1 (see below), the same modiﬁcation is done t o the moments that con- 
tribute to the normal stress, as shown below:

9.  TTOPT .  In LS-DYNA version 971R9, a modiﬁcation to the TR UE_T behavior 
was made to address a condition of weld elements th at are tied to shell ele- 
ments of signiﬁcantly diﬀerent stiﬀness.  This chan ge had unintended eﬀects 
on the behavior of weld failure, so a new option, T TOPT, was added to revert 
the behavior of TRUE_T to that of R8 and earlier ve rsions.  The default behav- 
ior of TTOPT is to continue with the new calculatio n but setting TTOPT = 1 
will cause the earlier method to be used.  Setting TTOPT = 2 will invoke 
TTOPT = 1 plus a change to make the welds invariant  with respect to solid 
element node numbering.  By default, failure is cal culated using forces on the *MAT_SPOTWELD  *MAT_100  
 bottom surface of the weld as deﬁned by nodes 1 to 4 of each element.  Setting 
TTOPT = 2 causes the average of the forces on the b ottom and top to be used so 
that failure is invariant. 
10.  History Data Output Files.  Spot weld force history data is written into the 
swforc  ASCII ﬁle.  In this database the resultant moments  are not available, but 
they are in the binary time history database and in  the ASCII elout  ﬁle. 
11.  Material Histories.   The probability of failure in solid or beam spotw elds can 
be estimated by retrieving the corresponding materi al histories for output to 
the d3plot  database. 
 
*DEFINE_MATERIAL_HISTORIES Properties  
 Label Attributes Description  
Instability - - - - A measure between 0 and 1 related to how 
close the spotweld element is to fail 
Damage - - - - Damage in the spotweld element betwe en 0 
and 1 
These two labels are supported for all options (OPT  and DMGOPT, including 
assemblies and beams), except for user deﬁned failu re.  The instability measure 
is the maximum over time; namely, it gives the maxi mum value for a given 
element throughout the simulation.  If a damage opt ion is invoked, then dam- 
age will initiate and increment when the instabilit y reaches unity, and elements 
are not deleted until the damage value reaches unit y.  If no damage option is 
invoked, then the damage output is always zero and elements will be deleted 
at the point when the instability measure reaches u nity 
OPT = -1 or 0 
OPT = 0 and OPT = -1 invoke a resultant-based failu re criterion that fails the weld if the 
resultants are outside of the failure surface deﬁne d by:

where the numerators in the equation are the resultants calculated in th e local 
coordinates of the cross section, and the denominators  are the values speciﬁed in the 
input.  If OPT = -1, the failure surface equation i s evaluated, but element failure is 
suppressed.  This allows easy identiﬁcation of vuln erable spot welds when post-
processing.  Failure is likely to occur if FC > 1.0 .  
 *MAT_100  *MAT_SPOTWELD  
 Alternatively, a *DEFINE_FUNCTION could be used to deﬁne the Weld Failure for 
OPT = 0. Then set FVAL = function ID. Such a functi on could look like this: 
*DEFINE_FUNCTION 
        100 
 func(nrr,nrs,nrt,mrr,mss,mtt)= (nrr/5.0)*(nrr/5.0)  
 
The six arguments for this function (nrr, …, mtt) a re the force and moment resultants 
during the computation. 
OPT = 1: 
OPT = 1 invokes a stress based failure model, which  was developed by Toyota Motor 
Corporation  and is based on the peak axial and transverse shea r stresses.  The weld fails 
if the stresses are outside of the failure surface deﬁned by

If strain rates are considered, then the failure cr iteria becomes:

than zero).  The peak stresses are calculated from the resultants using simple beam 
theory: n1n4n5n8

based failure is used orientation is very important.  No des n1  - n4 attach to the

surface.  The resultant forces and moment s are computed based on the 
assumption that the brick element is properly oriented. *MAT_SPOTWELD  *MAT_100

element used as a spot weld. 
OPT = 2 
OPT = 2 invokes a user-written subroutine uweldfail , documented in Appendix Q. 
OPT = 12 or 22 
OPT = 12 and OPT = 22 invoke similar user-written s ubroutines, uweldfail12  and 
uweldfail22 , respectively.  Both allow up to 22 failure parame ters to be used rather 
than the 6 allowed with OPT = 2.  OPT = 12 also all ows user control of weld damage. 
OPT = 3 
OPT = 3 invokes a failure based on notch stress, se e Zhang [1999].  Failure occurs when 
the failure criterion: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J8Cst− |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D439Cst ≥ 0 
is satisﬁed.  The notch stress is given by the equa tion:

welds are between sheets of unequal thickness, the minimum thickness of the spot

 OPT = 4 
OPT = 4 invokes failure based on structural stress intensity, see Zhang [1999].  Failure 
occurs when the failure criterion:

1, 2, 3 ) are input corrections factors with default values  of unity.  If spot welds are 
between sheets of unequal thickness, the minimum th ickness of the spot welded sheets 
may be used as a crude approximation. 
 
The maximum structural stress at the spot weld was utilized successfully for predicting 
the fatigue failure of spot welds, see Rupp, et.  a l . [1994] and Sheppard [1993].  The 
corresponding results from] Rupp, et.  al. are list ed below where it is assumed that they 
may be suitable for crash conditions. 
OPT = 5 
OPT = 5 invokes failure by

OPT = 10 
OPT = 10 invokes the failure criterion developed by  Lee and Balur (2011).  It is available 
for welds modeled by beam elements, solid elements,  or solid assemblies.  A detailed 
discussion of the criterion is given in the user’s manual section for *DEFINE_-
SPOTWELD_FAILURE. 
OPT = 11 
OPT = 11 invokes a resultant force based failure cr iterion for beams.  With correspond- 
ing load curves or tables LCT and LCC, resultant fo rce at failure |u1D439/u1D45:.st|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J9Cst  can be deﬁned as 
function of loading direction |u1D6F∆ (curve) or loading direction |u1D6F∆ and eﬀective strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇ 
(table): 
|u1D439fail = |u1D4J3 (|u1D6F∆)      or     |u1D439fail = |u1D4J3 (|u1D6F∆, |u1D7≠≠̇)

This is  Material Type 100.  The material model applies only  to solid element type l.  If 
hourglass type 4 is speciﬁed, then hourglass type 4  will be used; otherwise, hourglass 
type 6 will be automatically assigned.  Hourglass t ype 6 is preferred. 
Spot weld elements may be placed between any two de formable shell surfaces and tied 
with constraint contact, *CONTACT_TIED_SURFACE_TO_S URFACE, which 
eliminates the need to have adjacent nodes at spot weld locations.  Spot weld failure is 
modeled using this card and *DEFINE_CONNECTION_PROP ERTIES data.  Details of 
the failure model can be found in Seeger, Feucht, F rank, Haufe, and Keding [2005]. 
NOTE:  It is advisable to include all spot welds, which p ro- 
vide the slave nodes, and spot welded materials, 
which deﬁne the master segments, within a single 
*CONTACT_TIED_SURFACE_TO_SURFACE inter- 
face .  This contact type uses constraint equations.  If 
multiple interfaces are treated independently, sig-
niﬁcant problems can occur if such interfaces share  
common nodes.  An added beneﬁt is that memory 
usage can be substantially less with a single inter - 
face.  
Available options include: 
<BLANK> 
UNIAXIAL 
The UNIAXIAL keyword option causes the transverse s tresses and transverse strains to 
be zero for solid spot welds.  The older uniaxial m ethod, invoked with E < 0.0 on 
Card 1, assumed only the transverse stresses are ze ro.  Compared to the older method, 
the UNIAXIAL keyword option increases the stability  of the solver.  See Remark 1  for 
more details.

Remarks: 
1.  Loading Solid Welds Uniaxially. We have implemented two methods of 
loading solid and solid weld assemblies uniaxially.   The older method is in- 
voked by deﬁning the elastic modulus, |u1D438, as a negative number where the ab- 
solute value of |u1D438 is the desired value for |u1D438.  This uniaxial option causes the two 
transverse stress terms to be assumed to be zero th roughout the calculation.  
This assumption eliminates parasitic transverse str ess that causes slow growth 
of plastic strain-based damage.  
The other method is invoked by setting OPTION  to UNIAXIAL. This method is 
preferred.  It causes the two transverse stress ter ms and the two transverse 
strains terms to be set to zero.  It was added beca use we found that the older 
method sometimes induced spurious oscillations in t he axial force, leading to 
premature failure.  
The motivation for the uniaxial options can be expl ained with a weld loaded in 
tension.  Due to Poisson’s eﬀect, an element in ten sion would be expected to 
contract in the transverse directions.  However, be cause the weld nodes are *MAT_SPOTWELD_DAIMLERCHRYSLER  *MAT_100_DA  
 constrained to the mid-plane of shell elements, suc h contraction is only possi- 
ble to the degree that the shell element contracts.   In other words, the uniaxial 
stress state cannot be represented by the weld.  Fo r plastic strain-based dam- 
age, this eﬀect can be particularly apparent as it causes tensile stress to contin- 
ue to grow very large as the stress state becomes v ery nearly triaxial tension.  
In this stress state, plastic strain grows very slo wly so it appears that damage 
calculation is failing to knock down the stress.  B y simply assuming that the 
transverse stresses are zero, the plastic strain gr ows as expected and damage is 
much more eﬀective 
2.  Connection Properties.  This weld material is modeled with isotropic 
hardening plasticity.  The yield stress and constan t hardening modulus are 
assumed to be those of the welded shell elements as  deﬁned in a *DEFINE_-
CONNECTION_PROPERTIES table.  *DEFINE_CONNECTION_PR OPERTIES 
data also deﬁne a failure function and the damage t ype.  The interpretation of 
EFAIL and RS is determined by the choice of damage type.  This is discussed in 
Remark 4 on *DEFINE_CONNECTION_PROPERTIES. 
3.  Solid Weld Element Thickness.  Solid weld elements are tied to the mid-plane 
of shell materials and so typically have a thicknes s that is half the sum of the 
thicknesses of the welded shell sections.  As a res ult, a weld under shear load- 
ing can be subject to an artiﬁcially large moment w hich will be balanced by 
normal forces transferred through the tied contact.   These normal forces will 
cause the normal term in the failure calculation to  be artiﬁcially high.  Input- 
ting a TRUE_T that is smaller than the modeled thic kness, for example, 10%-
30% of true thickness will scale down the normal fo rce that results from the 
balancing moment and provide more realistic failure  calculations.  TRUE_T 
eﬀects only the failure calculation, not the weld e lement behavior.  If TRUE_-
T = 0 or data is omitted, the modeled weld element thickness is used. 
4.  Weld Assembly Failure.  For weld elements in an assembly (see RPBHX on 
*CONTROL_SPOTWELD_BEAM or *DEFINE_HEX_SPOTWELD_ASSE M-
BLY), the failure criterion is evaluated using the assembly cross section.  If 
damage is not active, all elements will be deleted when the failure criterion is 
met.  If damage is active, then damage is calculate d independently in each 
element of the assembly.  By default, elements of t he assembly are deleted as 
damage in each element is complete.  If ASFF = 1, t hen failure and deletion of 
all elements in the assembly will occur simultaneou sly when damage is com- 
plete in any one of the elements. 
5.  Output.  Solid element force resultants for *MAT_SPOTWEL_DA IMLER-
CHRYSLER are written to the spot weld force ﬁle, swforc , and the ﬁle for ele- 
ment stresses and resultants for designated element s, ELOUT .  Also, spot weld 
failure data is written to the ﬁle, dcfail . *MAT_100_DA  *MAT_SPOTWELD_DAIMLERCHRYSLER  
 6.  Deactivating Weld Failure.  An option to deactivate weld failure is switched 
on by setting CON_ID to a negative value where the absolute value of CON_-
ID becomes the connection ID.  When weld failure is  deactivated, the failure 
function is evaluated and output to swforc  and dcfail , but the weld retains its 
full strength. *MAT_GEPLASTIC_SRATE_2000a  *MAT_101

General Electric's commercially available engineeri ng thermoplastics subjected to high 
strain rate events.  This material model features t he variation of yield stress as a

element deletion of either ductile or brittle mater ials.

where |u1D7≠≠̇|zeroCst and |u1D434 are rate dependent yield stress parameters, |u1D446|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 is the internal 
resistance (strain hardening), and |u1D6F+ is a pressure dependence parameter. 
 
In this material the yield stress may vary througho ut the ﬁnite element model as a 
function of strain rate and hydrostatic stress.  Po st yield stress behavior is captured in 
material softening and hardening values.  Finally, ductile or brittle failure measured by 
plastic strain or maximum principal stress, respect ively, is accounted for by automatic 
element deletion. 
 
Although this may be applied to a variety of engine ering thermoplastics, GE Plastics 
have constants available for use in a wide range of  commercially available grades of 
their engineering thermoplastics. *MAT_INV_HYPERBOLIC_SIN  *MAT_102

Remarks: 
Resistance to deformation is both temperature and s train rate dependent.  The ﬂow 
stress equation is: 
|u1D7≠∆ =1
|u1D6F+sinh −|oneCst
⎣⎢⎡|parenleftCvJ|u1D44D
|u1D434|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D441Cst
⎦⎥⎤ 
where |u1D44D, the Zener-Holloman temperature compensated strain rate, is: 
|u1D44D = max(|u1D7≠≠̇,EPS0) × exp |parenleftCvJ|u1D444
GT |parenriµhtCvJ  . 
The units of the material constitutive constants ar e as follows: |u1D434 (1/sec), /u1D441 
(dimensionless), |u1D6F+ (1/MPa), the activation energy for ﬂow, |u1D444(J/mol), and the universal 
gas constant, |u1D43A (J/mol K).  The value of |u1D43A will only vary with the unit system chosen.  
Typically, it will be either 8.3144 J/(mol K), or 4 0.8825 lb in/(mol R). 
 
The ﬁnal equation necessary to complete our descrip tion of high strain rate deformation 
is one that allows us to compute the temperature ch ange during the deformation.  In the 
absence of a coupled thermo-mechanical ﬁnite elemen t code we assume adiabatic 
temperature change and follow the empirical assumpt ion that 90-95% of the plastic 
work is dissipated as heat.  Thus, the heat generat ion coeﬃcient is

This is  Material Type 103.  This anisotropic-viscoplastic m aterial model applies to shell

NA to determine the constants.  Kinematic, isotropi c, or a combination of kinematic and 
isotropic hardening may be used.  A detailed descri ption of this model can be found in 
the following references: Berstad, Langseth, and Ho pperstad [1994]; Hopperstad and 
Remseth [1995]; and Berstad [1996].  Failure is bas ed on eﬀective plastic strain or by a

The uniaxial stress-strain curve is given on the fo llowing form 
|u1D7≠∆(|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst) = |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D444|u1D4JFCst|oneCst/˙racketleft.v2(1 − exp(−|u1D436|u1D4JFCst|oneCst|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst))/˙racketright.v2+ |u1D444|u1D4JFCst|twoCst/˙racketleft.v21 − exp|parenleftCv2−|u1D436|u1D4JFCst|twoCst|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2/˙racketright.v2

For bricks the following yield criteria is used 
|u1D439(|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst )|twoCst+ |u1D43A(|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst − |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst )|twoCst+/u1D4:B(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst )|twoCst+ 2/u1D4:F|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|threeCst |twoCst+ 2|u1D44≠|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|oneCst |twoCst+ 2/u1D441|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst |twoCst
=/˙racketleft.v2|u1D7≠∆(|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst)/˙racketright.v2|twoCst 
where |u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain and |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain rate.  For 
shells the anisotropic behavior is given by |u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst , |u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst  and |u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst .  The model will work when 
the three ﬁrst parameters in Card 3 are given value s.  When |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst= 0, the material will 
behave elasto-plastically.  Default values are give n by: 
|u1D439 = |u1D43A =/u1D4:B=1
2 
/u1D4:F= |u1D44≠ =/u1D441=3
2 
|u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst = |u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst = |u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst = 1 
Strain rates are accounted for using the Cowper and  Symonds model which scales the 
yield stress with the factor: 
1  +  |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst
|u1D436|parenriµhtCv6|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
 *MAT_103  *MAT_ANISOTROPIC_VISCOPLASTIC  
 To convert these constants set the viscoelastic con stants, |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst and |u1D449|u1D4JACst, to the following 
values: 
|u1D449|u1D4J8Cst= |parenleftCvJ1
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D4JDCst
 
|u1D449|u1D4JACst=1
|u1D4JD 
If LCSS is nonzero, substitute the initial, quasi-s tatic yield stress for SIGY in the 
equation for |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst  above. 
 
This model properly treats rate eﬀects.  The viscop lastic rate formulation is an option in 
other plasticity models in LS-DYNA, such as *MAT_00 3 and *MAT_024, invoked by 
setting the parameter VP to 1. *MAT_ANISOTROPIC_PLASTIC  *MAT_103_P  
 *MAT_ANISOTROPIC_PLASTIC  
This is  Material Type 103_P.  This anisotropic-plastic mate rial model is a simpliﬁed 
version of the MAT_ANISOTROPIC_VISCOPLASTIC above.  This material model 
applies only to shell elements.

This is  Material Type 104.  This is a continuum damage mech anics (CDM) model which 
includes anisotropy and viscoplasticity.  The CDM m odel applies to shell, thick shell, 
and brick elements.  A more detailed description of  this model can be found in the 
paper by Berstad, Hopperstad, Lademo, and Malo [199 9].  This material model can also 
model anisotropic damage behavior by setting FLAG t o -1 in Card 2.

Remarks: 
1.  Standard Isotropic Damage Model (FLAG = 0 or 1).  The Continuum 
Damage Mechanics (CDM) model is based on an approac h proposed by Le- 
maitre [1992].  The eﬀective stress |u1D7≠∆̃, which is the stress calculated over the 
section that eﬀectively resist the forces, reads 
|u1D7≠∆̃=|u1D7≠∆
1 − |u1D437 
where |u1D437 is the damage variable.  The evolution equation fo r the damage varia- 
ble is deﬁned as 
|u1D437̇=

where |u1D7≠≠|eCst /f.st/f.st/co⋯⋯a.st/d.st|u1D4JDCst is the damage threshold, |u1D446 is the so-called damage energy release 
rate, and |u1D7≠∆|oneCst is the maximum principal stress.  The damage energ y density re- 
lease rate is

triaxiality function |u1D44J|u1D463Cst is deﬁned as

2.  Enhanced isotropic damage model (FLAG = 10 or 11).  A more sophisticated 
damage model that includes crack closure eﬀects (re duced damage under 
compression) and more ﬂexibility in stress state de pendence and functional 
expressions is invoked by setting FLAG = 10 or 11.  The corresponding evolu- 
tion equation for the damage variable is deﬁned as

where |u1D7≠∆̃|u1D4J6Cst are the principal eﬀective stresses and ℎ is the microdefects closure 
parameter that accounts for diﬀerent damage behavio r in tension and com- 
pression.  A value of ℎ≈ 0.2  is typically observed in many experiments as stat-
ed in Lemaitre [2000].  A parameter set of ℎ= 1, /u1D44C|zeroCst= 0, |u1D6F+ = 1 , /u1D̅0:= 1, and |u1D7≠2 = 0  
should give the same results as the standard isotro pic damage model 
(FLAG = 0 or 1) with |u1D7≠≠|eCst /f.st/f.st/co⋯⋯a.st/d.st|u1D4JDCst= 0 as long as |u1D7≠∆|oneCst> 0. 
3.  Strain Localization Check (FLAG = 1 or 11).  In order to add strain localiza- 
tion computation to the damage models above, parame ter FLAG should be set 
to 1 (standard damage) or 11 (enhanced damage).  An  acoustic tensor-based 
bifurcation criterion is checked and history variab le no.  4 is set to 1.0 if strain 
localization is indicated.  This is only available for shell elements. 
4.  Anisotropic Damage Model (FLAG = -1).  At each thickness integration 
points, an anisotropic damage law acts on the plane  stress tensor in the direc- 
tions of the principal total shell strains, |u1D7≠≠|oneCst and |u1D7≠≠|twoCst, as follows: 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst = [1 − |u1D437|oneCst(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst)]|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst|zeroCst 
|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst = [1 − |u1D437|twoCst(|u1D7≠≠|twoCst)]|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst|zeroCst 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst =|<racketleftCvJ1 −|u1D437|oneCst+ |u1D437|twoCst
2|<racketriµhtCvJ|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst|zeroCst  
The transverse plate shear stresses in the principa l strain directions are as- 
sumed to be damaged as follows: 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|threeCst = (1 − |u1D437|oneCst/2)|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|threeCst|zeroCst 
|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|threeCst = (1 − |u1D437|twoCst/2)|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|threeCst|zeroCst  *MAT_DAMAGE_1  *MAT_104  
 In the anisotropic damage formulation, |u1D437|oneCst(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst) and |u1D437|twoCst(|u1D7≠≠|twoCst) are anisotropic 
damage functions for the loading directions 1 and 2 , respectively.  Stresses 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst|zeroCst , |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst|zeroCst , |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst|zeroCst , |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|threeCst|zeroCst  and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|threeCst|zeroCst  are stresses in the principal shell strain directi ons 
as calculated from the undamaged elastic-plastic ma terial behavior.  The 
strains |u1D7≠≠|oneCst and |u1D7≠≠|twoCst are the magnitude of the principal strains calcula ted upon 
reaching the damage thresholds.  Damage can only de velop for tensile stresses, 
and the damage functions |u1D437|oneCst(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst) and |u1D437|twoCst(|u1D7≠≠|twoCst)are identical to zero for negative 
strains |u1D7≠≠|oneCst and |u1D7≠≠|twoCst. The principal strain directions are ﬁxed within an  integration 
point as soon as either principal strain exceeds th e initial threshold strain in 
tension.  A more detailed description of the damage  evolution for this material 
model is given in the description of Material 81. 
5.  Anisotropic Viscoplasticity. The uniaxial stress-strain curve is given in the 
following form 
|u1D7≠∆|parenleftCv2|u1D4JF, |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D444|oneCst|<racketleftCv11 − exp(−|u1D436|oneCst|u1D4JF)|<racketriµhtCv1 + |u1D444|twoCst|<racketleftCv11 − exp(−|u1D436|twoCst|u1D4JF)|<racketriµhtCv1 + |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst|u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst|u1D449Cst/u1D45A.sts , 
where |u1D4JF is the damage accumulated plastic strain, which ca n be calculated by 
|u1D4JḞ= |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst(1 − |u1D437) . 
For bricks the following yield criterion associated  with the Hill criterion is used 
|u1D439(|u1D7≠∆̃|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D7≠∆̃|threeCst|threeCst )|twoCst+ |u1D43A(|u1D7≠∆̃|threeCst|threeCst − |u1D7≠∆̃|oneCst|oneCst )|twoCst+/u1D4:B(|u1D7≠∆̃|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D7≠∆̃|twoCst|twoCst )|twoCst
+2/u1D4:F|u1D7≠∆̃|twoCst|threeCst |twoCst+ 2|u1D44≠|u1D7≠∆̃|threeCst|oneCst |twoCst+ 2/u1D441|u1D7≠∆̃|oneCst|twoCst |twoCst= |u1D7≠∆(|u1D4JF, |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst) 
where |u1D4JF is the damage eﬀective viscoplastic strain and |u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective visco- 
plastic strain rate.  For shells the anisotropic be havior is given by the R-values: 
|u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst , |u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst , and |u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst .  When |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst= 0, the material will behave as an elastoplastic 
material without rate eﬀects.  Default values for t he anisotropic constants are 
given by: 
|u1D439 = |u1D43A =/u1D4:B=1
2
/u1D4:F= |u1D44≠ =/u1D441=3
2
|u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst = |u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst = |u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst = 1 
so that isotropic behavior is obtained. 
Strain rate is accounted for using the Cowper and S ymonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor: 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
 
To convert these constants, set the viscoelastic co nstants, |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst and |u1D449|u1D4JACst, to the 
following values: *MAT_104  *MAT_DAMAGE_1  
 |u1D449|u1D4J8Cst= |u1D7≠∆ |parenleftCvJ1

continuum damage mechanics (CDM).  This material mo del applies to shell, thick shell,

Remarks: 
By deﬁning the tangent modulus (ETAN), the stress-s train behavior becomes a bilinear 
curve.  Alternately, a curve similar to that shown in Figure M10-1  is expected to be 
deﬁned by (EPS1, ES1)  - (EPS 8, ES 8); however, an eﬀective stress as a function of 
eﬀective plastic strain curve ID (LCSS) may be inpu t instead if eight points are 
insuﬃcient.  The cost is roughly the same for eithe r approach.  The most general 
approach is to use the table deﬁnition with table I D, LCSS, discussed below. 
Three options to account for strain rate eﬀects are  possible. 
1.  Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  , 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate, |u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
2.  For complete generality a load curve (LCSR) to sca le the yield stress may be 
input instead.  In this curve the scale factor as a  function of strain rate is de- 
ﬁned. 
3.  If diﬀerent stress as a function of strain curves can be provided for various 
strain rates, the option using the reference to a t able (LCSS) can be used.  Then 
the table input in *DEFINE_TABLE must be used; see Figure M24-1

which scales the yield stress with the factor:

These values can for example be used to evaluate th e hardness of the material. 
The additional variables are to be given by respect ive *DEFINE_FUNCTION 
keywords as functions of the cooling rate between T 2PHASE and T1PHASE, 
temperature, time, user-deﬁned histories themselves , equivalent plastic strain, 
rate of the equivalent plastic strain, and the ﬁrst  six history variables (see table

The equivalent stress for a ceramic-type material i s given by

where 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst∗= |u1D44∆|parenleftCv1|u1D4JD∗+ |u1D461∗|parenriµhtCv1|u1D4JBCst(1 +/u1D450ln|u1D7≠≠̇∗) 
represents the intact, undamaged behavior.  The sup erscript, “*”, indicates a normalized 
quantity.  The stresses are normalized by the equiv alent stress at the Hugoniot elastic 
limit, the pressures are normalized by the pressure  at the Hugoniot elastic limit, and the *MAT_110  *MAT_JOHNSON_HOLMQUIST_CERAMICS  
 strain rate by the reference strain rate deﬁned in the input.  In this equation |u1D44∆ is the 
intact normalized strength parameter, /u1D450 is the strength parameter for strain rate 
dependence, |u1D7≠≠̇∗ is the normalized plastic strain rate, and  
|u1D461∗=|u1D447

In the above, |u1D447 is the maximum tensile pressure strength, PHEL  is the pressure

represents the damaged behavior.  The parameter |u1D4J1|oneCst controls the rate at which damage 
accumulates.  If it is set to 0, full damage occurs  in one time step, that is, instantaneous- 
ly.  It is also the best parameter to vary when att empting to reproduce results generated 
by another ﬁnite element program. 
 
In undamaged material, the hydrostatic pressure is given by 
|u1D443 =/u1D458|oneCst|u1D7≠7 +/u1D458|twoCst|u1D7≠7|twoCst+/u1D458|threeCst|u1D7≠7|threeCst 
in compression and 
|u1D443 =/u1D458|oneCst|u1D7≠7 
in tension where |u1D7≠7 = |u1D7≠+ |u1D7≠+|zeroCst− 1 ⁄.  When damage starts to occur, there is an increas e in 
pressure.  A fraction, between 0 and 1, of the elas tic energy loss, |u1D6FD, is converted into 
hydrostatic potential energy (pressure).  The detai ls of this pressure increase are given 
in the reference. 
 
Given HEL  and G, |u1D7≠7hel  can be found iteratively from 
H EL =/u1D458|oneCst|u1D7≠7hel +/u1D458|twoCst|u1D7≠7hel |twoCst+/u1D458|threeCst|u1D7≠7hel |threeCst+ (4 3 ⁄ )|u1D4J4(|u1D7≠7hel /|parenleftCv11 + |u1D7≠7hel |parenriµhtCv1 
and, subsequently, for normalization purposes, 
|u1D443hel =/u1D458|oneCst|u1D7≠7hel +/u1D458|twoCst|u1D7≠7hel |twoCst+/u1D458|threeCst|u1D7≠7hel |threeCst 
and 
|u1D7≠∆hel = 1.5|parenleftCv1hel − |u1D4JDhel |parenriµhtCv1  . *MAT_JOHNSON_HOLMQUIST_CERAMICS  *MAT_110

This is  Material Type 111. This model can be used for concr ete subjected to large strains, 
high strain rates and high pressures.  The equivale nt strength is expressed as a function 
of the pressure, strain rate, and damage.  The pres sure is expressed as a function of the

strain curve for the lowest value of strain rate is  used if the strain

initial yield.  If this option is used, SIGY and ET AN are ignored 
and may be input as zero. 
ES1 - ES8 Corresponding yield stress values to EPS1  - EPS8. 
Remarks: 
By deﬁning the tangent modulus ETAN, the stress str ain behavior is treated using a 
bilinear stress strain curve.  Alternately, a curve  similar to that shown in Figure M10-1  is 
expected to be deﬁned by (EPS1, ES1)  - (EPS 8, ES 8); however, an eﬀective stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain curve (LCSS) ma y be input instead if eight points are 
insuﬃcient.  The cost is roughly the same for eithe r approach.  The most general 
approach is to use the table deﬁnition (LCSS) discu ssed below. 
 
Three options to account for strain rate eﬀects are  possible. 
1.  Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  , 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate, |u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
2.  For complete generality a load curve (LCSR) to sca le the yield stress may be 
input instead.  In this curve the scale factor as a  function of strain rate is de- 
ﬁned.   
3.  If diﬀerent stress as a function of strain curves can be provided for various 
strain rates, the option using the reference to a t able (LCSS) can be used.  Then 
the table input in *DEFINE_TABLE must be used; see Figure M24-1 .*MAT_113  *MAT_TRIP  
 *MAT_TRIP  
This is Material Type 113. This isotropic elasto-pl astic material model applies to shell 
elements only.  It features a special hardening law  aimed at modelling the temperature 
dependent hardening behavior of austenitic stainles s TRIP-steels.  TRIP stands for 
Transformation Induced Plasticity.  A detailed desc ription of this material model can be 
found in Hänsel, Hora, and Reissner [1998] and Sche din, Prentzas, and Hilding [2004].

Remarks: 
Here a short description is given of the TRIP-mater ial model.  The material model uses 
the von Mises yield surface in combination with iso tropic hardening.  The hardening is 
temperature dependent.  Therefore, this material mo del must be run either in a coupled 
thermo-mechanical solution, using prescribed temper atures or using the adiabatic 
temperature calculation option.  Setting the parame ter CP to the speciﬁc heat, |u1D436|u1D4JDCst, of the 
material activates the adiabatic temperature calcul ation that calculates the temperature 
rate from the equation 
|u1D447̇= |summationCv1|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D437|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JDCst

where /u1D6D4:/u1D40:|u1D4JDCst (the numerator) is the plastically dissipated heat .  Using the Kelvin scale is 
recommended, even though other scales may be used w ithout problems.

where |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain and |u1D447 is the temperature. 
 
The martensite fraction is integrated from the abov e rate equation: 
|u1D449|u1D4JACst=/integral.v:∂|u1D449|u1D4JACst
∂|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠Cst
|zeroCst|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst  . 
It always holds that 0.0 < |u1D449|u1D4JACst < 1.0. The initial martensite content is |u1D449|u1D4JACst|zeroCst and must be 
greater than zero and less than 1.0.  Note that |u1D449|u1D4JACst|zeroCst is not used during a restart or when 
initializing the |u1D449|u1D4JACst|zeroCst history variable using *INITIAL_STRESS_SHELL. 
 
The yield stress is: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst=/˙raceleft.v1|u1D43J|u1D43BCst /u1D446.st − (|u1D43J|u1D43BCst /u1D446.st − |u1D434|u1D43BCst /u1D446.st )exp|parenleftCv1−|u1D4JA[|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst+ |u1D7≠≠|zeroCst]|u1D4JBCst|parenriµhtCv1/˙raceright.v1(|u1D43∆|oneCst+ |u1D43∆|twoCst|u1D447) + ∆/u1D4:B/u1D6FE.st→/u1D6FC.st/⋯inute.sts|u1D449|u1D4JACst . *MAT_TRIP  *MAT_113  
 The parameters |u1D4JD and |u1D43J should fulﬁll the following condition 
1 + |u1D43J
|u1D43J< |u1D4JD  . 
If the condition is not fulﬁlled, then the martensi te rate will approach inﬁnity as |u1D449|u1D4JACst 
approaches zero.  Setting the parameter |u1D7≠≠|zeroCst larger than zero (typical range 0.001 - 0.02) is 
recommended.  Apart from the eﬀective true strain a  few additional history variables 
are output; see below.

 *MAT_LAYERED_LINEAR_PLASTICITY  
This is  Material Type 114.  It is a layered elastoplastic m aterial with an arbitrary stress 
as a function of strain curve.  An arbitrary strain  rate dependency can also be deﬁned.  
This material must be used with the user deﬁned int egration rules (see *INTEGRA-
TION-SHELL) for modeling laminated composite and sa ndwich shells where each layer 
can be represented by elastoplastic behavior with c onstitutive constants that vary from 
layer to layer.  Lamination theory is applied to co rrect for the assumption of a uniform 
constant shear strain through the thickness of the shell.  Unless this correction is 
applied, the stiﬀness of the shell can be grossly i ncorrect leading to poor results.  
Generally, without the correction the results are t oo stiﬀ.  This model is available for 
shell elements only.  See Remarks below.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
Table ID.  The table deﬁnes for each strain rate value a load curve 
ID giving the stress as a function of eﬀective plastic strain for that 
rate; see Figure M24-1 .  The stress as a function of eﬀective plastic 
strain curve for the lowest value of strain rate is  used if the strain 
rate falls below the minimum v alue.  Likewise, the stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain curve for the h ighest value of 
strain rate is used if the strain rate exceeds the maximum value.  
C, P, LCSR, EPS1 – EPS8, and ES1 – ES8 are ignored if a table ID is 
deﬁned. 
LCSR Load curve ID deﬁning strain rate scaling eﬀec t on yield stress 
EPS1 - EPS8 Eﬀective plastic strain values (optional if SIGY is  deﬁned).  At 
least 2 points should be deﬁned.  The ﬁrst point mu st be zero 
corresponding to the initial yield stress.  WARN ING: If the ﬁrst 
point is nonzero the yield stress is extrapolated t o determine the 
initial yield.  If this option is used, SIGY and ET AN are ignored 
and may be input as zero. 
ES1 - ES8 Corresponding yield stress values to EPS1  - EPS8. 
Remarks: 
The stress strain behavior may be treated by a bili near stress strain curve by deﬁning 
the tangent modulus, ETAN.  Alternately, a curve si milar to that shown in Figure M10-1  
is expected to be deﬁned by (EPS1, ES1) - (EPS8, ES 8); however, an eﬀective stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain curve (LCSS) ma y be input instead if eight points are 
insuﬃcient.  The cost is roughly the same for eithe r approach.  The most general 
approach is to use the table deﬁnition (LCSS) discu ssed below. 
Three options to account for strain rate eﬀects are  possible. 
1.  Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  , 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate; |u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
2.  For complete generality a load curve (LCSR) to sca le the yield stress may be 
input instead.  This curve deﬁnes the scale factor as a function of strain rate.   *MAT_LAYERED_LINEAR_PLASTICITY  *MAT_114  
 3.  If diﬀerent stress as a function of strain curves can be provided for various 
strain rates, the option using the reference to a t able (LCSS) can be used.  Then 
the table input in *DEFINE_TABLE must be used; see Figure M24-1 .*MAT_115  *MAT_UNIFIED_CREEP  
 *MAT_UNIFIED_CREEP  
This is  Material Type 115. This is an elastic creep model f or modeling creep behavior

where |u1D434, |u1D4JB, and |u1D4JA are constants and |u1D461̅ is the eﬀective time.  The eﬀective stress, |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt, is 
deﬁned as:

2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   . 
The creep strain, therefore, is only a function of the deviatoric stresses.  The volumetric 
behavior for this material is assumed to be elastic .  By varying the time constant |u1D4JA *MAT_UNIFIED_CREEP  *MAT_115  
 primary creep ( |u1D4JA < 1 ), secondary creep ( |u1D4JA = 1 ), and tertiary creep ( |u1D4JA > 1 ) can be 
modeled.  This model is described by Whirley and He nshall [1992]. *MAT_115_O  *MAT_UNIFIED_CREEP_ORTHO  
 *MAT_UNIFIED_CREEP_ORTHO  
This is  Material Type 115_O. This is an orthotropic elastic  creep model for modeling 
creep behavior when plastic behavior is not conside red.  This material is only available 
for solid elements and is available for both explic it and implicit dynamics.

 *MAT_COMPOSITE_LAYUP  
This is  Material Type 116.  This material is for modeling t he elastic responses of 
composite layups that have an arbitrary number of l ayers through the shell thickness.  
A pre-integration is used to compute the extensiona l, bending, and coupling stiﬀness 
for use with the Belytschko-Tsay resultant shell fo rmulation.  The angles of the local 
material axes are speciﬁed from layer to layer in t he *SECTION_SHELL input.  This 
material model must be used with the user deﬁned in tegration rule for shells (see *IN-
TEGRATION_SHELL) which allows the elastic constants  to change from integration 
point to integration point.  Since the stresses are  not computed in the resultant 
formulation, the stresses output to the binary data bases for the resultant elements are 
zero.  Note that this shell does not use laminated shell theory  and that storage is allocated 
for just one integration point (as reported in d3hsp ) regardless of the layers deﬁned in 
the integration rule.

where |u1D434|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  is the extensional stiﬀness, |u1D437|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst is the bending stiﬀness, and |u1D43J|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  is the coupling 
stiﬀness which is a null matrix for symmetric lay-u ps.  The mid-surface strains and 
curvatures are denoted by |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |zeroCst and /u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , respectively.  Since these stiﬀness matrices are 
symmetric, 18 terms are needed per shell element in  addition to the shell resultants 
which are integrated in time.  This is considerably  less storage than would typically be 
required with through thickness integration which r equires a minimum of eight history 
variables per integration point.  For instance, if 100 layers are used, 800 history variables 
would be stored.  Not only is memory much less for this model, but the CPU time 
required is also considerably reduced. *MAT_COMPOSITE_MATRIX  *MAT_117  
 *MAT_COMPOSITE_MATRIX  
This is  Material Type 117.  This material is used for model ing the elastic responses of 
composites where a pre-integration is used to compu te the extensional, bending, and 
coupling stiﬀness coeﬃcients for use with the Belyt schko-Tsay resultant shell 
formulation.  Since the stresses are not computed i n the resultant formulation, the 
stresses output to the binary databases for the res ultant elements are zero. 
NOTE:  This material does not support speciﬁcation of a m a- 
terial angle, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst, for each through-thickness integra- 
tion point of a shell.

 Remarks: 
1.  Failure Criterion.   When the catastrophic failure criterion is satisﬁ ed, the 
discrete element is deleted.  Failure for this mate rial depends directly on the 
displacement resultants.  The failure criterion dep ends on the value of FCRIT.  
If FCRIT = 0.0, failure occurs if either of the fol lowing inequalities are satisﬁed: 
|u1D434|u1D461Cst− 1 ≥ 0
|u1D434|u1D4J≠Cst− 1 ≥ 0 
where

/u1D̅0:|u1D461Cstcfail |<racketriµhtCv6|twoCst 
Positive (tension) values of displacement and rotat ion are considered in the 
ﬁrst criterion and negative (compression) values in  the second.  Either the ten- 
sion failure or the compression failure or both may  be used.  If any of the input 
failure displacements and rotations (UTFAILR etc) a re left as zero, the corre- 
sponding terms will be omitted from the equations f or A t and A c above.   
If FCRIT = 1.0, then a single criterion is used: 
|u1D434|u1D461Cst+ |u1D434|u1D4J≠Cst− 1 ≥ 0 
Thus, the combined eﬀect of all the displacements a nd rotations is considered, 
be they positive or negative. 
2.  Force.   There are two formulations for calculating the fo rce.  The ﬁrst is the 
standard displacement formulation, where, for examp le, the force in a linear 
spring is 
|u1D439 = −|u1D43∆∆ ℓ 
for a change in length of the beam of ∆ ℓ. The second formulation is based on 
the linear strain, giving a force of 
|u1D439 = −|u1D43∆∆ ℓ
ℓ|zeroCst 
for a beam with an initial length of ℓ|zeroCst. This option is useful when there are 
springs of diﬀerent lengths but otherwise similar c onstruction since it automat- *MAT_119  *MAT_GENERAL_NONLINEAR_6DOF_DISCRETE_BEAM  
 ically reduces the stiﬀness of the spring as the le ngth increases, allowing an 
entire family of springs to be modeled with a singl e material.  Note that all the 
displacement and velocity components are divided by  the initial length, and 
therefore the scaling applies to the damping and ro tational stiﬀness. 
3.  Rotational Displacement.   Rotational displacement is measured in radians.

This is  Material Type 120. This is the Gurson dilatational- plastic model.  This model is 
available for shell and solid elements.  A detailed  description of this model can be 
found in the following references: Gurson [1975, 19 77], Chu and Needleman [1980] and 
Tvergaard and Needleman [1984].  The implementation  in LS-DYNA is based on the 
implementation of Feucht [1998] and Faßnacht [1999] , which was recoded at LSTC.  
Strain rate dependency can be deﬁned using a table (see LCSS on Card 6).

LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID. If deﬁned, ATYP, EP S1 - EP S8 and ES1 
- ES8 are ignored. 
Load Curve.   When LC SS is a load curve ID, it is taken as 
deﬁning eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀective p lastic strain.  *MAT_GURSON  *MAT_120  
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the eﬀective stress as a funct ion eﬀective 
plastic strain for that rate; see Figure M24-1  and *MAT_ 024.  
When the strain rate falls below the minimum value,  the stress as 
a function of eﬀective plastic strain curve for the  lowest value of 
strain rate is used.   
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   If the ﬁrst  value in the table is 
negative, LS-DYNA assum es that all the table values represent 
the natural logarithm of a strain rate.  Since the tables are 
internally discretized to equally space the table v alues, it makes 
good sense from an accuracy standpoint that the tab le values 
represent the natural log o f strain rate when the lowest strain rate 
and highest strain rate diﬀer by several orders of magnitude.

LT.0.0: |N U MINT|  is percentage of integration points/layers 
which must fail before shell element fails.  For fu lly in- 
tegrated shells, a methodology is used where a layer 
fails if one integration point fails and then the g iven 
percentage of layers must fail before the element f ails.

LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID. If deﬁned, ATYP, EP S1 - EP S8 and ES1 
- ES8 are ignored. 
Load Curve.   When LC SS is a load curve ID, it is taken as 
deﬁning eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀective p lastic strain.  
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the eﬀective stress as a funct ion eﬀective 
plastic strain for that rate; see Figure M24-1  and *MAT_ 024.  
When the strain rate falls below the minimum value,  the stress as 
a function of eﬀective plastic strain curve for the  lowest value of 
strain rate is used.   
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   If the ﬁrst  value in the table is 
negative, LS-DY NA assumes that all the table values represent 
the natural logarithm of a strain rate.  Since the tables are 
internally discretized to equally space the table v alue s, it makes 
good sense from an accuracy standpoint that the tab le values 
represent the natural log of strain rate when the l owest strain rate 
and highest strain rate diﬀer by several orders of magnitude.

NUMINT Number of through thickness integration points whic h must fail 
before the element is deleted.  This option is avai lable for shells

LT.0.0: |N U MINT|  is the percentage of integration

For fu lly integrated shells, a methodology is used 
where a layer fails if one integration point fails and

EQ.2.0: Loading follows loading curve; unloading follows 
unloading stiﬀness, K, to the unloading curve.  The  
loading and unloading curves may only intersect at the 
origin of the axes. 
EQ.3.0: Quadratic unloading fr om peak displacement value to 
a permanent oﬀset. 
OFFSET Oﬀset to determine permanent set upon unloading if the 
IUNLD = 3.0.  The permanent sets in compression and tension  are 
equal to the product of this oﬀset value and the ma ximum 
compressive and tensile displacements, respectively . 
DAMPF Damping factor for stability.  Values in the neighb orhood of unity 
are recommended.  This damping factor is properly s caled to 
eliminate time step size dependency.  Also, it is a ctive if and only 
if the local stiﬀness is deﬁned. 
LCIDT Load curve ID deﬁning translational force resultant  along the axis 
as a function of relative translational displacemen t.  If zero, no 
stiﬀness related forces are generated for this degr ee of freedom.  
The loading curves must be deﬁ ned from the most negative 
displacement to the most positive displacement.  Th e force does 
not need to increase monotonically for the loading curve.  The 
curves are extrapolated when the displacement range  falls 
outside the curve deﬁnition. 
LCIDTU Load curve ID deﬁning translational force resultant  along the axis 
as a function of relative translational displacemen t during 
unloading.  The force values deﬁned by this curve m ust increase 
monotonically from the most negative displacement t o the most 
positive displacement.  For IUNLD = 1.0, the slope of this curve 
must equal or exceed the loading curve for stabilit y reasons.  This 
is not the case for IUNLD = 2.0.  For loading and unloading to 
follow the same path simply set LCIDTU = LCIDT. 
LCIDTD Load curve ID deﬁning translational damping force result ant 
along the axis as a function of relative translatio nal velocity. 
LCIDTE Load curve ID deﬁning translational damping force s cale factor as 
a function of relative displacement along the axis.  *MAT_GENERAL_NONLINEAR_1DOF_DISCRETE_BEAM  *MAT_121

Remarks: 
1.  Hill’s 1948 Yield Criterion.  Hill’s yield criterion is based on the assumptions 
that the material is orthotropic, that hydrostatic stress does not aﬀect yielding, 
and that there is no Bauschinger eﬀect.  According to Hill, when the principal 
axes of anisotropy are the axes of reference, the y ield surface has the form 
|u1D4J3 = |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt(/u1D̅48) − |u1D7≠∆yield |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 = 0, 
where the eﬀective stress |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt (stored as history variable #2) is given by

and where |u1D439, |u1D43A, /u1D4:B, /u1D4:F, |u1D44≠, and /u1D441 are material parameters of the current state of 
anisotropy, assuming three mutually orthogonal plan es of symmetry at every 
point.  The material /u1D46̅-direction is the reference direction. 
Let /u1D44B, /u1D44C, |u1D44D be the tensile yield stresses in the principal dir ections of anisotropy, 
then

where |u1D7≠∆y0 = |u1D7≠∆yield (0).  |u1D439, |u1D43A, and /u1D4:B are not uniquely determined, but the choice 
of |u1D439 + |u1D43A = 1  gives

axes of anisotropy, then

 If |u1D439 = |u1D43A =/u1D4:B, and, /u1D4:F= |u1D44≠ =/u1D441= 3|u1D439 , the Hill criterion reduces to the Von-Mises 
criterion. 
The strain hardening in this model can either deﬁne d by the load curve or by 
Swift’s exponential hardening equation: |u1D7≠∆yield =/u1D458(|u1D7≠≠ + 0.01)|u1D4JBCst. 
2.  Applications.   This material model is suitable for metal forming  application 
using solid elements to account for anisotropic pla sticity.  NUMISHEET con- 
ferences have provided material constants of Hill’s  1948 yield for many com- 
monly used materials.   
It can also be applied to multi-scale simulations o f ﬁberglass and laminated 
materials, according to CYBERNET SYSTEMS CO., LTD.  The elastic coeﬃ- 
cients can be calibrated analytically by a homogeni zation method with tensile 
tests in the three orthogonal directions and three pure shear tests in the three 
orthogonal planes. 
3.  Material Parameter Calibration.  The six material parameters required can be 
calibrated with nonlinear regression analysis (such  as those available through 
LS-OPT) through a series of tensile tests in three orthogonal directions and 
three shear tests in three orthogonal planes.

This is Material Type 123, which is an elasto-plast ic material supporting an arbitrary

model is available for shell and solid elements.  * MAT_PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLAS-
TICITIY is similar but lacks the enhanced failure c riteria.  Failure is based on eﬀective 
plastic strain, thinning strain, the major principa l in plane strain component, or a 
minimum time step size.   
Available options include: 
<BLANK> 
LOG_INTERPOLATION 
PRESTRAIN (for shells only)  
RATE 
RTCL 
STOCHASTIC (for shells only)  
The LOG_INTERPOLATION keyword option interpolates t he strain rate eﬀect in table 
LCSS with logarithmic interpolation.  
The PRESTRAIN option is used to include prestrain w hen checking for major strain 
failure.  The RATE option is used to account for ra te dependence of thinning failure or 
to invoke viscoelasticiy (LCEMOD).  The RTCL option  is used to activate RTCL damage 
(see Remark 1).  One additional card is needed with  any of these options.   
The STOCHASTIC keyword option allows spatially vary ing yield and failure behavior.  
See *DEFINE_STOCHASTIC_VARIATION for additional inf ormation.

LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID. 
Load Curve.   When LC SS is a Load curve ID, it is taken as 
deﬁning eﬀective stress vers us eﬀective plastic strain.  If deﬁned 
EPS1 - EPS8 and ES1 - ES8 are ignored. 
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the stress versus eﬀective pla stic strain for 
that rate, See Figure M24-1 .  When the strain rate falls below the 
minimum value, the stress versus eﬀective plastic s train curve for 
the lowest value of strain rate is used.  Likewise,  when the strain 
rate exceeds the maximum value the stress versus eﬀective plastic 
strain curve for the highest value of strain rate i s used.  Fields C, 
P, LCSR, EPS1 - EPS8, and ES1 - ES8 are ignored if a Table ID is 
deﬁned.  Linear interpolation between the discrete strain rates is 
used by default; logarithmic interpolation is used when the 
LOG_INTERPOLATION option is invoked. 
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   An alternative way to invoke 
logarithmic interpolation between discrete strain r ates is 
described as follows.  If the ﬁrst  value in the table is negative, LS-
DY NA assumes that all the table values represent the natural 
logarithm of a strain rate.  Since the tables are i nternally 
discretized to equally space the table values, it m akes good sense 
from an accuracy standpoint that the table va lues represent the *MAT_MODIFIED_PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLASTICITY  *MAT_123  
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
natural log of strain rate when the lowest strain r ate and highest 
strain rate diﬀer by several orders of magnitude.  There is some 
additional computational cost associated with invok ing 
logarithmic interpolation.

VP Formulation for rate eﬀects: 
EQ.0.0: Scale yield stress (default) 
EQ.1.0: Viscoplastic formulation (recommended) 
EPSTHIN Thinning strain at failure.  To specify thinning st rain to failure as 
a function of plastic strain rate, see LCTSRF. 
GT.0.0: Total thinning strain (as in ISTUPD = 1; see *CON-
TROL_SHELL) 
LT.0.0: Plastic thinning strain |EPST H IN | (as in ISTUPD = 4) 
EPSMAJ Major in plane strain at failure for shells (or) ma jor principal 
strain at failure for solids (see Remark 1 ). 
LT.0: EPSMAJ = |EPSMAJ| and ﬁltering is activated.  The last 
twelve values of the major strain is stored at each  integra- 
tion point and the average value is used to determi ne 
failure. 
NUMINT Number of integration points which must fail before  the element 
is deleted.  (If zero, all points must fail.)  For fully integrated shell 
formulations, each of the 4 × NIP integration points are counted 
individually in determining a total for failed inte gration points.  
NIP is the number of through- thickness integration points.  As 
NU MINT approaches the total number of integration poi nts (NIP 
for under integrated shells, 4 × NIP for fully integrated shells), the 
chance of instability increases. 
LT.0.0: |N U MINT|  is the percentage of integration 
points/layers which must fail before the shell elem ent 
fails.  For fully integrated shells, a methodology is used 
where a l ayer fails if one integration point fails and then 
the given percentage of layers must fail before the  ele- 
ment fails.  Only available for shells.

LCTSRF Curve that deﬁnes the thinning strain at failure as  a function of 
the plastic strain rate ( The curve should not extrapolate to zero or 
failure may occur at low strain. ) If LCT SRF is given, the absolute 
value of EP STHIN is unimportant; however, the algebraic sign o f 
EPSTHIN governs whether ordinate values in curve LC T SRF are 
interpreted as total or plastic thinning strain.  F or example, if 
plastic thinning strain should be used, then EP STHIN should be 
input as a negative value. 
EPS0 EPS0 parameter for RTCL damage (see Remark 2 ): 
EQ.0.0: RTCL damage is inactive (default).

TRIAX RTCL damage triaxiality limit (see Remark 2 ): 
EQ.0.0: No limit (default) 
GT.0.0: Damage does not accumulate when triaxiality exceeds  
TRIAX. 
IPS Flag to add prestrain when checking for major strai n failure (see 
EPSMAJ above on Card 2) for the PRESTRAIN keyword o ption: 
EQ.0:  No prestrain added (default) 
EQ.1:  Initial strain set with *INITIAL_STRAIN_ SHELL will be 
used as a prestrain when checking for major strain fail- 
ure (VP = 0 and shells only). 
LCEMOD Load curve ID deﬁning Young’s mod ulus as function of eﬀective 
strain rate.  LCEMOD ≠ 0 activates viscoelasticity.   See *MAT_-
187L for details.  The parameters BE TA and RFILTF have to be 
deﬁned too. 
(If LCEMOD ≠ 0 is used, VP = 1 should be deﬁned and failure 
options EPSTHIN, EPSMAJ, and RT CL are currently not 
available.) 
BETA Decay constant in viscoelastic law. BE TA has the unit [1/time]. If 
LCEMOD > 0 is used, a non-zero value for BETA is ma ndatory. 
RFILTF Smoothing factor on the eﬀective strain rate  (default is 0.95).  Th e 
ﬁltered strain rate is used for the viscoelasticity  (LCEMOD > 0).

 Remarks: 
1.  Major Principal Strain Failure.  The EPSMAJ parameter is compared to the 
major principal strain in the following senses: 
a)  For shells it is the maximum eigenvalue of the in- plane strain tensor that is 
incremented by the strain increments.  If IPS = 1, then prestrain set with 
*INITIAL_STRAIN_SHELL is also included in the strai n measure for 
shells.  
b)  For solid elements it is calculated as the maximum  eigenvalue to the loga- 
rithmic strain tensor 
/u1D6C6=1
2ln|parenleftCv2/u1D405/ε.st/u1D405|parenriµhtCv2  , 
where /u1D405 is the global deformation gradient.   
In sum, both element types use a natural strain mea sure for determining fail- 
ure.  The major strain calculated in this way is ou tput as history variable #7. 
2.  RTCL Damage. With the RTCL option, an RTCL damage is calculated and 
elements are deleted when the damage function excee ds 1.0.  During each solu- 
tion cycle, if the plastic strain increment is grea ter than zero, an increment of 
RTCL damage is calculated by

ed. *MAT_MODIFIED_PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLASTICITY  *MAT_123  
 The value of |u1D4J3damage  is stored as history variable #9 and can be fringe  plotted 
from d3plot  ﬁles if the number of extra history variables requ ested is ≥ 9 on 
*DATABASE_EXTENT_BINARY.  
The optional TRIAX parameter can be used to prevent  excessive RTCL damage 
growth and element erosion for badly shaped element s that might show unre- 
alistically high values for the triaxiality.  The t riaxiality, |u1D7≠∆Cst/u1D43B.sts
|u1D7≠∆Cst/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt, is stored as history 
variable #11. 
3.  Instability Indicator.  To get an idea about the probability of failure, a n 
indicator |u1D437 is computed internally: 
|u1D437 = max |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst
FAIL ,−|u1D7≠≠|threeCst
EPST H IN ,|u1D7≠≠/u1D4:C.st
EPSMAJ |parenriµhtCv6 
and stored as history variable #10.  |u1D437 ranges from 0 (intact) to 1 (failed). |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst, 
−|u1D7≠≠|threeCst, and |u1D7≠≠/u1D4:C.st are current values of eﬀective plastic strain, thi nning strain, and 
major in plane strain.  This instability measure, i ncluding the RTCL damage, 
can also be retrieved from requesting material hist ories

Implicit Calculations.   For implicit calculations with this material invo lving severe 
nonlinear hardening, the radial return method may r esult in inaccurate stress-strain 
response.  Setting IACC = 1 on *CONTROL_ACCURACY ac tivates a fully iterative 
plasticity algorithm, which will remedy this.  This  is not to be confused with the MITER 
ﬂag on *CONTROL_SHELL, which governs the treatment of the plane stress 
assumption for shell elements.  If any failure mode l is applied with this option, incident 
failure will initiate damage, and the stress will c ontinuously degrade to zero before 
erosion for a deformation of 1 %  plastic strain.  For instance, if the failure stra in is 
FAIL = 0.05 , then the element is eroded when |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.06  and the material goes from 
intact to completely damaged between |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.05  and |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst= 0.06 . The reason is to enhance 
implicit performance by maintaining continuity in t he internal forces. *MAT_124  *MAT_PLASTICITY_COMPRESSION_TENSION

This is  Material Type 124.  An isotropic elastic-plastic ma terial where unique yield 
stress as a function of plastic strain curves can b e deﬁned for compression and tension.  
Also, failure can occur based on a plastic strain o r a minimum time step size.  Rate 
eﬀects on the yield stress are modeled either by us ing the Cowper-Symonds strain rate 
model or by using two load curves that scale the yi eld stress values in compression and 
tension, respectively.   Material rate eﬀects, whic h are independent of the plasticity 
model, are based on a 6-term Prony series Maxwell m ode that generates an additional 
stress tensor.  The viscous stress tensor is superi mposed on the stress tensor generated 
by the plasticity.

Remarks: 
1.  Stress-Strain Behavior.  The stress-strain behavior follows a diﬀerent curve  
in compression than it does in tension.  Tension is  determined by the sign of 
the mean stress where a positive mean stress (meani ng a negative pressure) is 
indicative of tension.  Two curves must be deﬁned g iving the yield stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain for both the te nsion and compression re- 
gimes. 
Mean stress is an invariant which can be expressed as (|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D467Cst)/3.  PC 
and PT deﬁne a range of mean stress values within w hich interpolation is done 
between the tensile yield surface and compressive y ield surface.  PC and PT 
are not true material properties but are just a num erical convenience so that the 
transition from one yield surface to the other is n ot abrupt as the sign of the 
mean stress changes.  Both PC and PT are input as p ositive values as it is im- *MAT_PLASTICITY_COMPRESSION_TENSION  *MAT_124  
 plied that PC is a compressive mean stress value an d PT is tensile mean stress 
value. 
Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper a nd Symonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor: 
1 +|<racketleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|<racketriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2

This is  Material Type 125.  This material model combines Yo shida and Uemori’s non-
linear kinematic hardening rule with material type 37. Yoshida and Uemori’s theory 
uses two surfaces to describe the hardening rule: t he yield surface and the bounding 
surface.  In the forming process, the yield surface  does not change in size, but its center 
translates with deformation; the bounding surface c hanges both in size and location.  In 
addition, the change of Young’s modulus can be a fu nction of eﬀective plastic strain as 
proposed by Yoshida and Uemori [2002].  This materi al type is available for shells, thick 
shells and solid elements. 
Available options include: 
<BLANK> 
NLP 
The NLP option estimates necking failure using the Formability Index (F.I.), which 
accounts for the non-linear strain paths seen in me tal forming applications (see A 
Failure Criterion for Nonlinear Strain Paths (NLP)  in the remarks section).  When using 
this option, specify IFLD  in Card 3.  Since the NLP option also works with a  linear 
strain path, it is recommended to be used as the de fault failure criterion in metal 
forming.  The NLP option is also available for *MAT _036, *MAT_037, and *MAT_226.

HLCID Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_CURVE) g iving true strain as a

below and should not be referenced or used in other  keywords. 
Using this parameter is not recommended.  
OPT Error calculation ﬂag.   The default value of “0” is recommended.  
EQ.2:  LS-DYNA will perform error calculation based on the 
true stress- strain curve from uniaxial tension, speciﬁed

load curve, both in the loading and unloading porti ons.  
Since, in some c ases where loading is more complex, the 
accumulated plastic strain could be large (say more  than 
30%), the input uniaxial stress- strain curve must have 
enough strain range to cover the maximum expected 
plastic strain.  Note this variable must be set to a v alue of 
“2” if HLCID is speciﬁed and a stress- strain curve is 
used.

The Yoshida & Uemori Kinematic Hardening Model: 
The two-surface model from Yoshida and Uemori is in dicated by the following 
equations where the variable descriptions are indic ated in Figure M125-1  [2]: 
|u1D6F+∗= |u1D6F+ − |u1D6FD
|u1D6F+∗=/u1D450|<racketleftCv6|parenleftCv4|u1D44∆

|u1D6F+∗|u1D6F+∗|<racketriµhtCv6 |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst
|u1D44∆ = |u1D43J + |u1D44J −/u1D44C 
The anisotropic hardening parameter, |u1D44J̇, depends on the value of IOPT.  The original 
Yoshida and Uemori model includes saturation in str ain hardening (IOPT = 0) [ 1, 2] and 
was modiﬁed to include continuous hardening (IOPT =  1).  The change in the parameter 
is as follows: 
|u1D44J̇=/u1D458(|u1D44Jsat − |u1D44J)|u1D7≠≠̅̇|u1D4JDCst           if IOPT = 0

The change of size and location for the bounding su rface is deﬁned as follows, with

In Yoshida and Uemori’s paper, the material paramet er /u1D450 which controls the rate of the 
kinematic hardening is modiﬁed to describe more acc urately the forward and reverse 
deformations of the cyclic plasticity curve in the vicinity of the initial yield.  The 
parameter /u1D450 is modiﬁed as: |u1D43J+|u1D44J /u1D44C

uncoupled.  The second yield surface considers the eﬀects of oﬀ-axis loading.  It is 
transversely isotropic.  However, because of this d eﬁnition of the second yield surface, 
the material can collapse in a shear mode due to lo w shear resistance.  There was no 
obvious way of increasing the shear resistance with out changing the behavior in purely 
uniaxial compression.  Therefore, with the third yi eld surface, the model has been 
modiﬁed so that the shear and hydrostatic resistanc e can be prescribed for the material 
without aﬀecting the uniaxial behavior.  The choice  of the second yield surface is 
ﬂagged by the sign of the ﬁrst load curve ID, LCA.  The third yield surface is ﬂagged by 
the sign of ECCU, which becomes the initial stress yield limit in simple shear.  A 
description is given below. 
 
The development of the second and third yield surfa ces are based on experimental test 
results of aluminum honeycomb specimens at Toyota M otor Corporation. 
 
The default element for this material is solid type  0, a nonlinear spring type brick 
element.  The recommended hourglass control is the type 2 viscous formulation for one 
point integrated solid elements.  The stiﬀness form  of the hourglass control when used 
with this constitutive model can lead to nonphysica l results since strain localization in 
the shear modes can be inhibited.

Remarks: 
1.  Load Curves and Efﬁciency.   For eﬃciency it is strongly recommended that 
the load curve IDs: LCA, LCB, LCC, LCS, LCAB, LCBC,  and LCCA, contain 
exactly the same number of points with correspondin g strain values on the 
abscissa.  If this recommendation is followed, the cost of the table lookup is 
insigniﬁcant.  Conversely, the cost increases signi ﬁcantly if the abscissa strain 
values are not consistent between load curves. 
2.  Elastic Moduli.  For solid element formulations 1 and 2, and thick s hell 
formulations 3, 5, and 7, the behavior before compa ction is orthotropic where 
the components of the stress tensor are uncoupled, meaning a component of 
strain will generate resistance in the local |u1D44∆-direction with no coupling to the 
local |u1D44F and /u1D450 directions.  The elastic moduli vary from their in itial values to the 
fully compacted values linearly with the relative v olume:

The relative volume, |u1D449, is deﬁned as the ratio of the current volume over  the 
initial volume, and typically, |u1D449 = 1  at the beginning of a calculation.  
For corotational solid elements, types 0 and 9, the  components of the stress 
tensor remain uncoupled and the uncompressed elasti c moduli are used, that 
is, the fully compacted elastic moduli are ignored.  
3.  Stress Update for Uncompacted Material.   The load curves deﬁne the 
magnitude of the stress as the material undergoes d eformation.  The ﬁrst value 
in the curve should be less than or equal to zero c orresponding to tension and 
increase to full compaction.  Care should be taken when deﬁning the curves so the  
extrapolated values do not lead to negative yield s tresses.  
At the beginning of the stress update we transform each element’s stresses and 
strain rates into the local element coordinate syst em.  After completing the 
stress update we transform the stresses back to the  global conﬁguration.  For 
the uncompacted material, the trial stress componen ts are updated using the 
elastic interpolated moduli according to: 0Curve extends into negative strain 
quadrant since LS-DYNA will 
extrapolate using the two end points.
It is important that the extropolation 
does not extend into the negative 
stress region.

Unloading is based on the interpolated Young’s 
moduli which must provide an unloading tangent 
that exceeds the loading tangent. σij

If LCA > 0, each component of the updated stress te nsor is checked to ensure

/divides.v:|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCsttrial /divides.v: 
On Card 3  |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenriµhtCv2 is deﬁned in the load curve speciﬁed in columns 31 -40 for 
the aa stress component, 41-50 for the bb  component, 51-60 for the cc compo- 
nent, and 61-70 for the ab, bc, cb  shear stress components.  The parameter |u1D7≠6 is 
either unity or a value taken from the load curve n umber, LCSR, that deﬁnes |u1D7≠6 
as a function of strain-rate.  Strain-rate is deﬁne d here as the Euclidean norm of 
the deviatoric strain-rate tensor. 
If LCA < 0, a transversely isotropic yield surface is obtained where the uniaxial 
limit stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2/u1Dℜ11, |u1D7≠≠v ol |parenriµhtCv2, can be deﬁned as a function of angle /u1Dℜ11 with the strong 
axis and volumetric strain, |u1D7≠≠v ol .  In order to facilitate the input of data to such  a 
limit stress surface, the limit stress is written a s: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2/u1Dℜ11, |u1D7≠≠v ol |parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|parenleftCv1/u1Dℜ11|parenriµhtCv1 + |parenleftCv1cos /u1Dℜ11|parenriµhtCv1|twoCst|u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠v ol |parenriµhtCv2 + |parenleftCv1sin /u1Dℜ11|parenriµhtCv1|twoCst|u1D7≠∆|u1D464Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠v ol |parenriµhtCv2 
where the functions |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst, and |u1D7≠∆|u1D464Cst are represented by load curves LCA, LCB, 
LCC, respectively.  The latter two curves can be us ed to include the stiﬀening 
eﬀects that are observed as the foam material crush es to the point where it 
begins to lock up.  To ensure that the limit stress  decreases with respect to the 
oﬀ-angle the curves should be deﬁned such that foll owing equations hold: 
∂|u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|parenleftCv1/u1Dℜ11|parenriµhtCv1
∂/u1Dℜ11≤ 0 
and  
|u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠v ol |parenriµhtCv2 − |u1D7≠∆|u1D464Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠v ol |parenriµhtCv2 ≥ 0. 
A drawback of this implementation was that the mate rial often collapsed in 
shear mode due to low shear resistance.  There was no way of increasing the 
shear resistance without changing the behavior in p ure uniaxial compression.  
We have therefore modiﬁed the model so that the use r can optionally prescribe 
the shear and hydrostatic resistance in the materia l without aﬀecting the uniax- *MAT_MODIFIED_HONEYCOMB  *MAT_126  
 ial behavior.  We introduce the parameters |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st) and |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st) as the hydro- 
static  and shear  limit stresses , respectively.  These are functions of the volumet ric 
strain and are assumed given by  
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠v ol ) = |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠v ol )
|u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠v ol ) = |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠v ol )  , 
where we have reused the densiﬁcation function |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst.  The new parameters are 
the initial hydrostatic and shear limit stress valu es, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st and |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st, and are provid- 
ed by the user as GCAU and |ECC U |, respectively.  The negative sign of ECCU 
ﬂags the third yield surface option whenever LCA < 0.  The eﬀect of the third 
formulation is that (i) for a uniaxial stress the s tress limit is given by 
|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st(/u1D̅1∫, |u1D7≠≠v ol ), (ii) for a pressure the stress limit is given by |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st), and (iii) for a 
simple shear the stress limit is given by |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st).  Experiments have shown 
that the model may give noisy responses and inhomog eneous deformation 
modes if parameters are not chosen with care.  We t herefore recommend to (i) 
avoid large slopes in the function |u1D7≠∆|u1D443Cst, (ii) let the functions |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst and |u1D7≠∆|u1D464Cst be slightly 
increasing, and (iii) avoid large diﬀerences betwee n the stress limit values 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst(/u1Dℜ11, |u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st), |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st) and |u1D7≠∆/u1D451.st/u1D44C.st(|u1D7≠≠|vCst /o.st/l.st). These guidelines are likely to contradict how 
one would interpret test data and it is up to the u ser to ﬁnd a reasonable trade-
oﬀ between matching experimental results and avoidi ng the mentioned nu- 
merical side eﬀects. 
4.  Stress Update for Fully Compacted Material.   As in the uncompacted case, 
we transform each element’s stresses and strain rat es into the local element 
coordinate system.  For fully compacted material (e lement formulations 1 and 
2), we assume that the material behavior is elastic -perfectly plastic and updat- 
ed the stress components according to: 
|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst trial = |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+ 2|u1D43A∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D451.st |u1D4J2Cst|u1D463Cst/u1D45B.sts+|oneCsts|twoCsts/fraction.v2
 
where the deviatoric strain increment is deﬁned as 
∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D451.st |u1D4J2Cst|u1D463Cst = ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst −1
3∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
We now check to see if the yield stress for the ful ly compacted material is ex- 
ceeded by comparing  
|u1D46≠eff trial = |parenleftCvJ3
2|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst trial |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst trial |parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2
 
the eﬀective trial stress to the yield stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst (Card 1, ﬁeld 41-50).  If the eﬀec- 
tive trial stress exceeds the yield stress we simpl y scale back the stress compo- 
nents to the yield surface 
|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst=|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst
|u1D46≠eff trial |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst trial . *MAT_126  *MAT_MODIFIED_HONEYCOMB  
 We can now update the pressure using the elastic bu lk modulus, |u1D43∆ 
|u1D4JD|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D4JD|u1D4JBCst− |u1D43∆∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst|twoCst/fraction.v2
|u1D43∆ =|u1D438
3(1 − 2/u1D̅08) 
and obtain the ﬁnal value for the Cauchy stress 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst− |u1D4JD|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
After completing the stress update, we transform th e stresses back to the global 
conﬁguration.

the results from the ﬁt.  Always check the results of the ﬁt in the 
output ﬁle.  Preferably, all generated coeﬃcients s hould be

Remarks: 
Rubber is generally considered to be fully incompre ssible since the bulk modulus 
greatly exceeds the shear modulus in magnitude.  To  model the rubber as an 
unconstrained material a hydrostatic work term, /u1D44A|u1D43BCst(/u1D4:D), is included in the strain energy 
functional which is function of the relative volume , /u1D4:D, [Ogden 1984]:

or in terms of the second Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress, |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , and Green's strain tensor, |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , *MAT_ARRUDA_BOYCE_RUBBER  *MAT_127

where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) and |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) are the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent stre ss 
measures.  This stress is added to the stress tenso r determined from the strain energy 
functional. 
 
If we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, the relaxation function is represented by 
up to six terms from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst

|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a dampers and springs in 
series.  We characterize this in the input by shear  moduli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and decay constants, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.

 *MAT_SPECIAL_ORTHOTROPIC  
This is  Material Type 130.  This model is available for Bel ytschko-Tsay and C0 
triangular shell elements.  It is based on a result ant stress formulation.  In-plane 
behavior is treated separately from bending in orde r to model perforated materials, 
such as television shadow masks.  If other shell fo rmulations are speciﬁed, the 
formulation will be automatically switched to Belyt schko-Tsay.  As implemented, this 
material model cannot be used with user deﬁned inte gration rules. 
NOTE:  This material does not support speciﬁcation of a m a- 
terial angle, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst, for each through-thickness integra- 
tion point of a shell.

Three methods are oﬀered to model progressive failu re.  The maximum principal stress 
criterion detects failure if the maximum (most tens ile) principal stress exceeds |u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst|xCst . 
Upon failure, the material can no longer carry stre ss. *MAT_ISOTROPIC_SMEARED_CRACK  *MAT_131  
  
The second failure model is the smeared crack model  with linear softening stress-strain 
using equivalent uniaxial strains.  Failure is assu med to be perpendicular to the 
principal strain directions.  A rotational crack co ncept is employed in which the crack 
directions are related to the current directions of  principal strain.  Therefore, crack 
directions may rotate in time.  Principal stresses are expressed as

Cauchy stress tensor, |u1D7≠∆, is expressed as 
|u1D7≠∆=(1−|u1D437)E|u1D7≠≠ (131.6)  
where |u1D437 represents the current damage and the factor 1 − |u1D437  is the reduction factor 
caused by damage.  The scalar damage variable is ex pressed as function of a so-called 
damage equivalent strain |u1D7≠≠/u1D451.st *MAT_131  *MAT_ISOTROPIC_SMEARED_CRACK  
 |u1D437=|u1D437(|u1D7≠≠/u1D451.st)=1−|u1D7≠≠ini (|u1D7≠≠ult −|u1D7≠≠/u1D451.st)
|u1D7≠≠/u1D451.st(|u1D7≠≠ult −|u1D7≠≠ini )  ,  (131.7)  
where 
|u1D7≠≠/u1D451.st=/u1D458−1
2/u1D458(1−2|u1D463)/u1D4:D|oneCst+1
2/u1D458/radical.v6|parenleftCvJ/u1D458−1
1−2|u1D463/u1D4:D|oneCst|parenriµhtCvJ|twoCst
+6/u1D458
(1+|u1D463)|twoCst/u1D4:D|twoCst  . (131.8)  
Here the constant /u1D458 represents the ratio of the strength in tension ov er the strength in 
compression 
/u1D458=|u1D7≠∆ult ,tension  
|u1D7≠∆ult , compression   , (131.9)  
/u1D4:D|oneCst and /u1D4:D|twoCst are the ﬁrst and second invariant of the strain te nsor representing the 
volumetric and the deviatoric straining, respective ly 
/u1D4:D|oneCst=tr (|u1D7≠≠) 
/u1D4:D|twoCst=tr (|u1D7≠≠⋅|u1D7≠≠)−1
3[|u1D461|u1D4JF (|u1D7≠≠)]|twoCst (131.10) 
If the compression and tension strength are equal, the dependency on the volumetric 
strain vanishes in ( 131.8 ) and failure is shear dominated.  If the compressi ve strength is 
much larger than the strength in tension, /u1D458 becomes small and the /u1D4:D|oneCst terms in ( 131.8 ) 
dominate the behavior. *MAT_ORTHOTROPIC_SMEARED_CRACK  *MAT_132

Remarks: 
This is an orthotropic material with optional delam ination failure for brittle composites.  
The elastic formulation is identical to the DYNA3D model that uses total strain 
formulation.  The constitutive matrix C that relates to global components of stress to the  
global components of strain is deﬁned as: 
C = T|u1D447CstC|u1D43FCstT 
where T is the transformation matrix between the local mat erial coordinate system and 
the global system and C|u1D43FCstis the constitutive matrix deﬁned in terms of the m aterial 
constants of the local orthogonal material axes |u1D44∆, |u1D44F, and /u1D450 (see DYNA3D use manual). 
 
Failure is described using linear softening stress strain curves for the interlaminar 
normal and interlaminar shear directions.  The curr ent implementation for failure is 
essentially two-dimensional.  Damage can occur in t he interlaminar normal direction 
and a single interlaminar shear direction.  The ori entation of these directions with 
respect to the principal material directions must b e speciﬁed by the user. 
 
Based on speciﬁed values for the ultimate stress an d the critical energy release rate 
bounding surfaces are deﬁned as 
|u1D4J3|u1D4JBCst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst− |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D4JBCst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JBCst) 
|u1D4J3|u1D46≠Cst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst− |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D46≠Cst) 
where the subscripts |u1D4JB and |u1D46≠ refer to the normal and shear component.  If stres ses 
exceed the bounding surfaces, inelastic straining o ccurs.  The ultimate strain is obtained 
by relating the crack growth energy and the dissipa ted energy.  For solid elements with 
a single integration point it can be derived to obt ain 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.stult =2|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D434
|u1D449|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.stult  *MAT_ORTHOTROPIC_SMEARED_CRACK  *MAT_132  
 with |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst as the critical energy release rate, |u1D449 as the element volume, |u1D434 as the area 
perpendicular to the active normal direction and |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st ult  as the ultimate stress.  For the 
normal component failure can only occur under tensi le loading.  For the shear 
component the behavior is symmetric around zero.  T he resulting stress bounds are 
depicted in Figure M132-1 .  Unloading is modeled with a Secant stiﬀness.

This is Material Type 133. This model was developed  by Barlat et al.  [2003] to overcome 
some shortcomings of the six parameter Barlat model  implemented as material 33 
(MAT_BARLAT_YLD96) in LS-DYNA. This model is availa ble for shell elements only.  
Starting with release R12, this model is also avail able for solid elements (at ﬁrst only for 
explicit analysis), based on the approach by Dunand  et al.  [2012].

3.  Kinematic Hardening Model.   A kinematic hardening model is implemented 
following the works of Chaboche and Roussilier.  A back stress, /u1D6C2, is intro- 
duced such that the eﬀective stress is computed as 
|u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st= |u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst − 2|u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst , |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst − 2|u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst , |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|twoCst ) . 
The back stress is the sum of up to four terms acco rding to 
|u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J8Cst|fourCst
|u1D4J8Cst=|oneCst  , 
and the evolution of each back stress component is as follows 
|u1D6FF|u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J8Cst= |u1D436|u1D4J8Cst|parenleftCvJ|u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst − |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst

4.  Hansel Hardening Law.   The Hansel hardening law is the same as in materi al 
113 but is repeated here for the sake of convenienc e.  
The hardening is temperature dependent and therefor e this material model 
must be run either in a coupled thermo-mechanical s olution, using prescribed 
temperatures or using the adiabatic temperature cal culation option.  Setting the 
parameter CP to the speciﬁc heat Cp of the material activates the adiabatic tem- 
perature calculation that calculates the temperatur e rate from the equation  
|u1D447̇= |summationCv1|u1D7≠∆/u1D422/u1D423|u1D437|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /p.st
|u1D7≠+|u1D436|u1D4JDCst |u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J7Cst  , 
where /u1D6D4:/u1D40:|u1D4JDCst (the numerator) is the plastically dissipated heat .  Using the Kelvin 
scale is recommended, even though other scales may be used without prob- 
lems. *MAT_BARLAT_YLD2000  *MAT_133  
 The hardening behaviour is described by the followi ng equations.  The mar- 
tensite rate equation is

where |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain and |u1D447 is the temperature.  The martensite 
fraction is integrated from the above rate equation : 
|u1D449|u1D4JACst=/integral.v:∂|u1D449|u1D4JACst
∂|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠≠Cst
|zeroCst|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst. 
It always holds that 0.0 < |u1D449|u1D4JACst< 1.0 . The initial martensite content is |u1D449|u1D4JACst|zeroCst and 
must be greater than zero and less than 1.0.  Note that |u1D449|u1D4JACst|zeroCst is not used during a 
restart or when initializing the |u1D449|u1D4JACst history variable using *INITIAL_STRESS_-
SHELL. 
The yield stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst is 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst=/˙raceleft.v1|u1D43J|u1D43BCst /u1D446.st − (|u1D43J|u1D43BCst /u1D446.st − |u1D434|u1D43BCst /u1D446.st )exp|parenleftCv1−|u1D4JA[|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst+ |u1D7≠≠|zeroCst]|u1D4JBCst|parenriµhtCv1/˙raceright.v1(|u1D43∆|oneCst+ |u1D43∆|twoCst|u1D447) + ∆/u1D4:B/u1D6FE.st→/u1D6FC.st |minuteCst|u1D449|u1D4JACst. 
The parameters P and B should fulﬁll the following condition 
1 + |u1D43J
|u1D43J< |u1D4JD  . 
If not fulﬁlled, the martensite rate will approach inﬁnity as |u1D449|u1D4JACst approaches 
zero.  A value between 0.001 and 0.02 is recommende d for |u1D7≠≠|zeroCst.   
Apart from the eﬀective true strain a few additiona l history variables are out- 
put as described in the table below. 
 
History 
Variable # Description 
26 Yield stress of material at temperature TREF.  This  
variable is useful when evaluating the strength of 
the material after, for example, a simulated 
forming operation. 
27 Volume fraction martensite, |u1D449|u1D4JACst 
28 If CP = 0.0, it is not used.  If CP > 0.0, then it is the 
temperature from the adiabatic temperature 
calculation. *MAT_133  *MAT_BARLAT_YLD2000  
 5.  Heat Treatment.   Heat treatment for increasing the formability of prestrained 
aluminum sheets can be simulated through the use of  HTFLAG, where the 
intention is to run a forming simulation in steps i nvolving preforming, spring- 
back, heat treatment, and postforming.  In each ste p the history is transferred 
to the next using a dynain  ﬁle (see *INTERFACE_SPRINGBACK).  The ﬁrst two 
steps are performed with HTFLAG = 0 according to st andard procedures, re- 
sulting in a plastic strain ﬁeld |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst corresponding to the prestrain.  The heat 
treatment step is performed using HTFLAG = 1 in a c oupled thermomechani- 
cal simulation, where the blank is heated.  The cou pling between thermal and 
mechanical processes is only through the maximum te mperature |u1D447|zeroCst being 
stored as a history variable in the material model,  corresponding to the heat 
treatment temperature.  Here it is important to exp ort all history variables to 
the dynain  ﬁle for the postforming step.  In the ﬁnal postfor ming step, HT-
FLAG = 2, the yield stress is then augmented by the  Hocket-Sherby like term 
∆|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D44F − (|u1D44F − |u1D44∆)exp |<racketleftCv4− /u1D450|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst− |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv2/u1D451.st|<racketriµhtCv4 , 
where |u1D44∆, |u1D44F, /u1D450, and |u1D4J1 are given as tables as functions of the heat treatm ent tem- 
perature |u1D447|zeroCst and prestrain |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst. That is, in the table deﬁnitions each load curve 
corresponds to a given prestrain and the load curve  value is with respect to the 
heat treatment temperature, 
|u1D44∆ = |u1D44∆|parenleftCv2|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv2  , |u1D44F = |u1D44F|parenleftCv2|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv2  ,/u1D450=/u1D450|parenleftCv2|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv2  , |u1D4J1 = |u1D4J1(|u1D447|zeroCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|zeroCst)

This is Material Type 134.  The viscoelastic fabric  model is a variation on the general 
viscoelastic model of material 76.  This model is v alid for 3 and 4 node membrane 
elements only and is strongly recommended for model ing isotropic viscoelastic fabrics 
where wrinkling may be a problem.  For thin fabrics , buckling can result in an inability 
to support compressive stresses; thus, a ﬂag is inc luded for this option.  If bending 
stresses are important use a shell formulation with  model 76.

Remarks: 
Rate eﬀects are taken into accounted through linear  viscoelasticity through a 
convolution integral of the form: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst |u1D461Cst

where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) is the relaxation function.  If we wish to include  only simple rate 
eﬀects for the deviatoric stresses, the relaxation function is represented by six terms 
from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4JACst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst . 
We characterize this function by the input shear mo duli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and decay constants, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.  
An arbitrary number of terms, up to 6, may be used when applying the viscoelastic 
model.  
 
For volumetric relaxation, the relaxation function is also represented by the Prony series 
in terms of bulk moduli: 
/u1D458(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43∆|u1D4JACst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D̅05.sts/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst . *MAT_134  *MAT_VISCOELASTIC_FABRIC  
 For an example of a stress relaxation curve see Figure M134-1 . This curve deﬁnes stress 
as a function of time where time is deﬁned on a log arithmic scale.  For best results, the 
points deﬁned in the load curve should be equally s paced on the logarithmic scale.  
Furthermore, the load curve should be smooth and de ﬁned in the positive quadrant.  If 
nonphysical values are determined by least squares ﬁt, LS-DYNA will terminate with 
an error message after the initialization phase is completed.  If the ramp time for 
loading is included, then the relaxation which occu rs during the loading phase is taken 
into account.  This eﬀect may or may not be importa nt. 10n10n+110n+210n+3σ∕ε0

work hardening rate at large values of eﬀective pla stic strain.  If 
the isotropic work hardening rate predicted by the utilized Voce-
type work hardening rule falls below the speciﬁed value it is 
substituted by the prescribed value or switched to a power- law 
hardening if S100 ≠ 0.  This option should be considered for 
problems involving extensive plastic deformations.  If process 
dependent material characteristics are prescribed, that is, if LC > 0 
the same minimum tangent modulus is assumed for all  the 
prescribed work hardening curves.  If instead EMIN < 0 then –
EMIN deﬁnes the plastic strain value at which the l inear or 
power-law hardening approximation commences.

|u1D44∆|oneCst through |u1D44∆/eight.st are identiﬁed on the basis of prescribed material data internally 
in the material routine, ﬁles with point data for p lotting of the identiﬁed yield 
surface, along with the predicted directional varia tion of the yield stress and 
plastic ﬂow are generated in the directory where th e LS-DYNA analysis is run.  
Four diﬀerent ﬁles are generated for each speciﬁed material. 
These ﬁles are named according to the scheme: 
a)  Contour_1 # 
b)  Contour_2 # 
c)  Contour_3 # *MAT_WTM_STM  *MAT_135  
 d)  R_and_S # 
where # is a value starting at 1. 
The ﬁrst three ﬁles contain contour data for plotti ng of the yield surface as 
shown in Figure M135-2 . To generate these plots a suitable plotting progr am 
should be adopted and for each ﬁle/plot, column A s hould be plotted as a 
function of column B.  Figure M135-3  further shows a plot generated from the 
ﬁnal ﬁle named R_and_S # showing the directional dependency of the normal-
ized yield stress (column A vs.  B) and plastic str ain ratio (column B vs.  C).

 *MAT_VEGTER  
This is Material Type 136 (formerly named *MAT_CORU S_VEGTER), a plane stress 
orthotropic material model for metal forming.  Yiel d surface construction is based on 
the interpolation by second-order Bezier curves, an d model parameters are determined 
directly from a set of mechanical tests conducted f or several directions.  For each 
direction, four mechanical tests are carried out: a  uniaxial, an equi-biaxial, a plane strain 
tensile test and a shear test.  These test results are used to determine the coeﬃcients of 
the Fourier directional dependency ﬁeld.  For a mor e detailed description please see

the second reference point. |u1D7≠7 is a parameter which determines the location on th e curve 
(0 ≤ |u1D7≠7 ≤ 1 ).   Figure M136-2.   Vegter yield surface. *MAT_136  *MAT_VEGTER  
 Four characteristic  stress states are selected as reference points: the equi-biaxial point 
(|u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|u1D4J6Cst , |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst|u1D4J6Cst ), the plane strain point |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst|u1D46≠Cst|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JDCst|u1D46≠Cst|twoCst|parenriµhtCv2, the uniaxial point (|u1D7≠∆|u1D462Cst|u1D4JBCst , 0) and the pure 
shear point (|u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst/uni210E.st, −|u1D7≠∆|u1D46≠Cst/uni210E.st); see Figure M136-2 . Between the 4 stress points, 3 Bézier curves 
are used to interpolate the yield locus.  Symmetry conditions are used to construct the 
complete surface.  The yield locus in Figure M136-2  shows the reference points of 
experiments for one speciﬁc direction.  The referen ce points can also be determined for 
other angles to the rolling direction (planar angle  /u1D̅0:). For example, if N = 2 is chosen, 
normalized yield stresses for directions 0°, 45°, a nd 90° should be deﬁned.  A Fourier 
series is used to interpolate intermediate angles b etween the measured points. 
The Vegter yield function with isotropic hardening (ALPHA = 1) is given as: 
/u1D̅1∫= |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|twoCst,/u1D̅0:) − |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1 
with the equivalent stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st obtained from the appropriate Bézier function rela ted to 
the current stress state.  The uniaxial yield stres s |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst can be deﬁned as stress-strain curve 
LCID or alternatively as a functional expression: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ ∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JACst/˙racketleft.v:|u1D6FD(|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst+ |u1D7≠≠|zeroCst) +|parenleftCv31 − |u1D4J2−/Ome∧∙.st(|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|u1D4JDCsts+|u1D7≠≠Cst|zeroCsts)|parenriµhtCv3|u1D4JBCst/˙racketright.v: 
In case of kinematic hardening (ALPHA < 1), the sta ndard stress tensor is replaced by a 
relative stress tensor, deﬁned as the diﬀerence bet ween the stress tensor and a back 
stress tensor. 
 
To determine the yield stress or reference points o f the Vegter yield locus, four 
mechanical tests have to be performed for diﬀerent directions.  A good description 
about the material characterization procedure can b e found in Vegter et al.  (2003). *MAT_VEGTER_STANDARD  *MAT_136_STD  
 *MAT_VEGTER_STANDARD  
This is Material Type 136_STD, a plane stress ortho tropic material model for metal 
forming.  Yield surface construction is based on th e interpolation by second-order 
Bezier curves, and model parameters are determined directly from a set of mechanical 
tests conducted for a number of directions.  For ea ch direction, four mechanical tests are 
carried out: a uniaxial, an equi-biaxial, a plane s train tensile test and a shear test.  The 
material formulation is equivalent to MAT_VEGTER, e xcept it requires diﬀerent 
parameters for the plane strain tensile test and ca n use the Bergström-Van Liempt 
equation to deal with strain rate eﬀects.  These te st results are used to determine the 
coeﬃcients of the Fourier directional dependency ﬁe ld.  For a more detailed description 
please see Vegter and Boogaard [2006].

Remarks: 
1.  Yield Locus.   The yield locus description of this material is t he same as for 
*MAT_VEGTER.  The materials share the same Bézier i nterpolation for the 
section-wise deﬁnition of the yield locus and also use the same four character- 
istic stress states as reference points.  They only  diﬀer in the plane-strain point 
deﬁnition in the input.  This material MAT_VEGTER_S TANDARD does not 
expect the direct input of the two components |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆ps|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆ps|twoCst|parenriµhtCv2, but only of the ﬁrst 
component |u1D7≠∆ps|oneCst. The second component is assumed to be at a ﬁxed d istance *MAT_136_STD  *MAT_VEGTER_STANDARD  
 between the hinge points on both sides.  This dista nce is deﬁned by fac- 
tor  |u1D6F+ps = |u1D6F+|oneCst|u1D6F+|twoCst⁄, as shown in Figure M136-1 .  This approach is favored in most 
publications and has for example been discussed in the PhD-thesis of Pijlman, 
H. H. (2001). 
To determine the yield stress or reference points o f the Vegter yield locus, four 
mechanical tests must be performed for diﬀerent dir ections.  A good descrip- 
tion about the material characterization procedure can be found in Vegter et al.  
(2003). 
2.  Strain Hardening.   The Vegter yield function with isotropic hardenin g (AL-
PHA = 1) is given as: 
/u1D̅1∫= |u1D7≠∆e q (|u1D7≠∆|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|twoCst,/u1D̅0:) − |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̅̇|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|parenriµhtCv1 
with the equivalent stress |u1D7≠∆e q  obtained from the appropriate Bézier function 
related to the current stress state.  The uniaxial yield stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst can be deﬁned as 
a yield stress curve, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1, or a yield stress surface, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|parenriµhtCv1, with LCID. In 
contrast to *MAT_VEGTER, this material also provide s the Bergström-Van

replaced by a relative stress tensor, deﬁned as the  diﬀerence between the stress 
tensor and a back stress tensor. *MAT_136_2017  *MAT_VECTER_2017

This is Material Type 136_2017, a plane stress orth otropic material model for metal 
forming.  It features the advanced Vegter yield loc us based on the interpolation by 
second-order Bezier curves.  Model parameters are d etermined from uniaxial test data 
at 0°, 45° and 90° to the rolling direction.  There fore, the same mechanical tests must be 
carried out as for Hill’s 1948 planar anisotropic m aterial model.  For a more detailed 
description of the yield locus, please see Vegter a nd Boogaard [2006].  The relationships 
between the results of uniaxial testing and the adv anced yield locus are introduced and 
discussed in Abspoel et al [2017].

1.  Yield Locus.   The yield locus description of this material is t he same as for 
*MAT_VEGTER.  The materials share the same Bézier i nterpolation for the 
section-wise deﬁnition of the yield locus.  
The four characteristics stress states are predicte d based on standard parame- 
ters from uniaxial tensile tests.  This approach ha s been presented by Abspoel 
et al.  (2017).  Test data for 0°, 45°, and 90° to rolling direction must be given to 
account for anisotropic behavior of the material.  The resulting formulation is 
then equivalent with *MAT_VEGTER_STANDARD and N = 2 . 
2.  Strain Hardening.   The Vegter yield function with isotropic hardenin g (AL-
PHA = 1) is given as: 
/u1D̅1∫= |u1D7≠∆e q (|u1D7≠∆|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|twoCst,/u1D̅0:) − |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̅̇|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|parenriµhtCv1 
with the equivalent stress |u1D7≠∆e q  obtained from the appropriate Bézier function

Remarks: 
1.  Ultimate Displacements.  The ultimate displacements in the normal and 
tangential directions are the displacements at the time when the material has 
failed completely, that is, the tractions are zero.   The linear stiﬀness for loading 
followed by the linear softening during the damage provides an especially 
simple relationship among the energy release rates,  peak tractions, and ulti- 
mate displacements: 
GIC = |u1D447 ×U ND

GIIC = |u1D446 ×U TD

 If the peak tractions are not speciﬁed, they are co mputed from the ultimate 
displacements.  See Fiolka and Matzenmiller [2005] and Gerlach, Fiolka and 
Matzenmiller [2005].  
2.  Mixed-Mode Relative Displacement.   In this cohesive material model, the 
total mixed-mode relative displacement, |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst, is deﬁned as  |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst=/radical.v2|u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st|twoCst+ |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st|twoCst, 
where |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st= |u1D6FF|threeCst is the separation in normal direction (mode I) and  |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st=/radical.v2|u1D6FF|oneCst|twoCst+ |u1D6FF|twoCst|twoCst 
is the separation in tangential direction (mode II) .  The mixed-mode damage 
initiation displacement |u1D6FF|zeroCst (onset of softening) is given by 
|u1D6FF|zeroCst= |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st|zeroCst|u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st|zeroCst/radical.v61 + |u1D6FD|twoCst

where |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st|zeroCst= |u1D447/EN  and |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st|zeroCst= |u1D446/ET  are the single mode damage initiation sepa- 
rations and |u1D6FD = |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st/|u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st is the “mode mixity” (see Figure M138-1 ). The ultimate 
mixed-mode displacement |u1D6FF|u1D439Cst (total failure) for the power law (XMU > 0) is:

 A reasonable choice for the exponent |u1D6F∆ would be GAMMA = 1.0 (default) or 
GAMMA = 2.0. 
3.  Interface Damage.   In this model, damage of the interface is conside red, that 
is, irreversible conditions are enforced with loadi ng/unloading paths coming 
from/pointing to the origin. 
4.  Peak Tractions as Load Curves.   Peak tractions |u1D447 and/or |u1D446 can be deﬁned as 
functions of characteristic element length (square root of mid-surface area) 
using a load curve.  This option helps obtain the s ame global responses (e.g. 
load-displacement curve) with coarse meshes when co mpared to a ﬁne mesh 
solution.  In general, lower peak traction values a re needed for coarser meshes.  
5.  Error Checks of Material Data.   Two error checks have been implemented for 
this material model in order to ensure proper mater ial data.  Since the traction 
as a function of displacement curve is fairly simpl e (triangular shaped), equa- 
tions can be developed to ensure that the displacem ent, /u1D4:F, at the peak load 
(QMAX), is smaller than the ultimate distance for f ailure, |u1D462.  See Figure M138-2  
for the used notation. 
As shown in Figure M138-2 , 
GC =1

and 
/u1D4:F=QMAX

To ensure that the peak is not past the failure poi nt, |u1D462/u1D4:F⁄ must be larger than 1.

This is  Material Type 139.  This material which is for the Belytschko-Schwer resultant 
beam is an extension of MAT_029.  In addition to th e original plastic hinge and collapse 
mechanisms of MAT_029, yield moments may be deﬁned as a function of axial force.  
After a hinge forms, the moment transmitted by the hinge is limited by a moment-
plastic rotation relationship.

 Remarks: 
1.  Load Curves.   This material model is available for the Belytsch ko resultant 
beam element only.  Plastic hinges form at the ends  of the beam when the mo- 
ment reaches the plastic moment.  The plastic momen t as a function of rotation 
relationship is speciﬁed by the user in the form of  a load curve and scale factor.  
The points of the load curve are (plastic rotation in radians, plastic moment).  
Both quantities should be positive for all points, with the ﬁrst point being (ze- 
ro, initial plastic moment).  Within this constrain t any form of characteristic 
may be used, including ﬂat or falling curves.  Diﬀe rent load curves and scale 
factors may be speciﬁed at each node and about each  of the local |u1D46≠ and |u1D461 axes. 
Axial collapse occurs when the compressive axial lo ad reaches the collapse 
load.  Collapse load as a function of collapse deﬂe ction is speciﬁed in the form 
of a load curve.  The points of the load curve are either 
|parenleftCv1true strain, collapse force|parenriµhtCv1  or |parenleftCv1change in length, collapse force|parenriµhtCv1 .  Both quanti- 
ties should be entered as positive for all points a nd will be interpreted as com- 
pressive.  The ﬁrst point should be |parenleftCv1zero, initial collapse load|parenriµhtCv1 . 
The collapse load may vary with end moment as well as with deﬂections.  In 
this case several load-deﬂection curves are deﬁned,  each corresponding to a 
diﬀerent end moment.  Each load curve should have t he same number of 
points and the same deﬂection values.  The end mome nt is deﬁned as the aver- 
age of the absolute moments at each end of the beam  and is always positive. 
2.  Damping.   Stiﬀness-proportional damping may be added using the damping 
factor |u1D7≠6.  This is deﬁned as follows: 
|u1D7≠6 =2 ×/u1D̅0∫
|u1D714 
where /u1D̅0∫ is the damping factor at the reference frequency |u1D714 (in radians per sec- 
ond).  For example, if 1% damping at 2Hz is require d 
|u1D7≠6 =2 × 0.01 
2/u1D̅0B× 2= 0.0015 92 
If damping is used, a small time step may be requir ed.  LS-DYNA does not 
check this so to avoid instability it may be necess ary to control the time step 
using a load curve.  As a guide, the time step requ ired for any given element is 
multiplied by 0.3/u1D4:F/u1D450|u1D7≠6 ⁄ when damping is present ( /u1D4:F = element length, /u1D450 = sound 
speed). 
3.  Moment Interaction.   Plastic hinges can form due to the combined actio n of 
moments about the three axes.  This facility is act ivated only when yield mo- 
ments are deﬁned in the material input.  A hinge fo rms when the following 
condition is ﬁrst satisﬁed. *MAT_139  *MAT_MODIFIED_FORCE_LIMITED

plied to the yield moments:  for example, |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cstyield  in the above formula is given 
by the input yield moment about the local axis time s the input scale factor for 
the local |u1D46≠-axis.  For strain-softening characteristics, the y ield moment should 
generally be set equal to the initial peak of the m oment-rotation load curve. M1M1M2M3M4M5M6M7M8

 On forming a hinge, upper limit moments are set.  T hese are given by

moments will be given by 
|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JDCst= min(|u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstupper , |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstcur v e )  , 
where |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JDCsts is the current plastic moment and |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCstcur v e  is the moment from the 
load curve at the current rotation scaled by the sc ale factor.  |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D4JDCstand |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst|u1D4JDCst satisfy 
similar conditions.  |u1D44≠|u1D46≠Cst|u1D4JDCstand |u1D44≠|u1D461Cst|u1D4JDCst satisfy similar conditions. 
This provides an upper limit to the moment that can  be generated; it represents 
the softening eﬀect of local buckling at a hinge si te.  Thus, if a member is bent 
about the local |u1D46≠-axis, it will then be weaker in torsion and about its local |u1D461-axis.  
For moments-softening curves, the eﬀect is to trim oﬀ the initial peak (although 
if the curves subsequently harden, the ﬁnal hardeni ng will also be trimmed 
oﬀ). 
It is not possible to make the plastic moment vary with the current axial load, 
but it is possible to make hinge formation a functi on of axial load and subse- 
quent plastic moment a function of the moment at th e time the hinge formed.  
This is discussed in Remark 4 . 
4.  Independent Plastic Hinge Formation.   In addition to the moment interac- 
tion equation, Cards 7 through 18 allow plastic hin ges to form independently 
for the |u1D46≠-axis and |u1D461-axis at each end of the beam as well as for the to rsional axis.  
A plastic hinge is assumed to form if any component  of the current moment 
exceeds the yield moment as deﬁned by the yield mom ent as a function axial 
force curves input on cards 7 and 8.  If any of the  5 curves is omitted, a hinge 
will not form for that component.  The curves can b e deﬁned for both compres- 
sive and tensile axial forces.  If the axial force falls outside the range of the 
curve, the ﬁrst or last point in the curve will be used.  A hinge forming for one 
component of moment does not aﬀect the other compon ents. 
Upon forming a hinge, the magnitude of that compone nt of moment will not 
be permitted to exceed the current plastic moment.  The current plastic mo- 
ment is obtained by interpolating between the plast ic moment as a function of 
plastic rotation curves input on cards 10, 12, 14, 16, or 18.  Curves may be input 
for up to 8 hinge moments, where the hinge moment i s deﬁned as the yield 
moment at the time that the hinge formed.  Curves m ust be input in order of 
increasing hinge moment and each curve should have the same plastic rotation 
values.  The ﬁrst or last curve will be used if the  hinge moment falls outside the 
range of the curves.  If no curves are deﬁned, the plastic moment is obtained *MAT_139  *MAT_MODIFIED_FORCE_LIMITED  
 from the curves on cards 4 through 6.  The plastic moment is scaled by the 
scale factors on lines 4 to 6. 
A hinge will form if either the independent yield m oment is exceeded or if the 
moment interaction equation is satisﬁed.  If both a re true, the plastic moment 
will be set to the minimum of the interpolated valu e and |u1D44≠|u1D4JFCst|u1D4JDCsts.*MAT_VACUUM  *MAT_140

This is Material Type 142.  This model is for an ex truded foam material that is 
transversely isotropic, crushable, and of low densi ty with no signiﬁcant Poisson eﬀect.  
This material is used in energy-absorbing structure s to enhance automotive safety in 
low velocity (bumper impact) and medium high veloci ty (interior head impact and 
pedestrian safety) applications.  The formulation o f this foam is due to Hirth, Du Bois, 
and Weimar and is documented by Du Bois [2001]. 
This material is not wholly isotropic since the ext rusion direction is preferred.  The 
properties in directions orthogonal to the extrusio n direction are, however, the same.  In 
other words, the material is isotropic in all trans versal directions to extrusion.

AOPT Material axes option (see MAT _OPTION TROPIC_ELASTIC, 
particularly the Material Directions  section, for details): 
EQ.0.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes 1, 2, and 4, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_ NODES. For shells only, the material axes are 
then rotated a bout the normal vector to the surface of 
the shell by the angle BETA. 
EQ.1.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y a 
point, |u1D443, in space and the global location of the element 
center; this is the /u1D41A-direction.  This option is for solid 
elements only. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-
NATE_VECTOR 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by a 
vector /u1D42F and the normal vector to the plane of the ele- 
ment.  The plane of a solid element is the midsurface 
between the inner surface and outer surface deﬁned by 
the ﬁrst four nodes and the last four nodes of the con- 
nectivity of the element, respectively.  Thus, for solid 
elements, AOPT = 3 is only available for hexahedrons. 
/u1D41A is determined by taking the cross product of /u1D42F with 
the normal vector, /u1D41B is determined by taking the cross 
product of the normal vector with /u1D41A, and /u1D41C is the nor- 
mal vector.  Then /u1D41A and /u1D41B are rotated about /u1D41C by an an- 
gle BETA. BETA m ay be set in the keyword input for 
the element or in the input for this keyword.  Note  that 
for solids, the material axes may be switched depen d- 
ing on the choice of MACF. The switch may occur be-
fore or after applying BE TA depending on the value of 
MACF.

with the material axes determined by a vector /u1D42F, and *MAT_TRANSVERSELY_ISOTROPIC_CRUSHABLE_FOAM  *MAT_142

is.  This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system ID 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ OPTION ).   
ISCL Load curve ID for the strain rate scale factor as a  function of the 
volumetric strain rate.  The yield stress is scaled  by the value 
speciﬁed by the load curve. 
BETA Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 0 (shells and tshells only) 
and AOPT = 3 (all element types).  This angle may be overridde n 
on the element card; see *ELEMENT_SHELL_BETA, *ELE-
MENT_TSHELL_BETA, and *ELEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO. 
MACF Material axes change ﬂag for solid elements: 
EQ.-4: Switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450 before BETA rotation 
EQ.-3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450 before BETA rotation 
EQ.-2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F before BETA rotation  
EQ.1: No change, default 
EQ.2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F after BETA rotation 
EQ.3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450 after BETA rotation 
EQ.4: Switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450 after BETA rotation 
Figure M2-2  indicates when LS-DY NA applies MACF during the 
process to obtain the ﬁnal material axes.  If BETA on *ELE-
MENT_SOLID_{OPTION} is deﬁned, then that BE TA is used for 
the rotation for all AOPT options.  Otherwise, if A OPT = 3, the 
BETA input on Card 3 rotates the axes.  For all other values of 
AOPT, the material axes will be switched as speciﬁe d by MACF, 
but no BETA rotation will be performed.

 Remarks: 
This model behaves in a more physical way for oﬀ ax is loading the material than, for 
example, *MAT_HONEYCOMB which can exhibit nonphysic al stiﬀening for loading 
conditions that are oﬀ axis.  The curves given for I11, I22, I12 and I23 are used to deﬁne 
a yield surface of Tsai-Wu-type that bounds the dev iatoric stress tensor.  Hence the 
elastic parameters E11, E12, E22 and E23 as well as  G and K must be deﬁned in a 
consistent way.  
For the curve deﬁnitions volumetric strain |u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst= 1 − |u1D449/|u1D449|zeroCst is used as the abscissa 
parameter.  If the symmetric option (NSYM = 1) is u sed, a curve must be provided for 
the ﬁrst quadrant, but may also be deﬁned in both t he ﬁrst and second quadrants.  If 
NSYM = 0 is chosen, the curve deﬁnitions for I11, I 22, I12 and I23 (and IAA) must be in 
the ﬁrst and second quadrant as shown in Figure M142-1 .  
Tensor viscosity, which is activated by a nonzero v alue for MU, is generally more stable 
than bulk viscosity.  A damping coeﬃcient less than  0.01 has little eﬀect, and a value 
greater than 0.10 may cause numerical instabilities . NSYM = 0

Remarks: 
1.  Quality Factors.   Material property data is for clear wood (small s amples 
without defects like knots), whereas real structure s are composed of graded 
wood.  Clear wood is stronger than graded wood.  Qu ality factors (strength 
reduction factors) are applied to the clear wood st rengths to account for reduc- 
tions in strength as a function of grade.  One qual ity factor (QUAL_T) is ap- 
plied to the tensile and shear strengths.  A second  quality factor (QUAL_C) is 
applied to the compressive strengths.  As an option , predeﬁned quality factors 
are provided based on correlations between LS-DYNA calculations and test 
data for pine and ﬁr posts impacted by bogie vehicl es.  By default, quality fac- 
tors are applied to both the parallel and perpendic ular to the grain strengths.  
An option is available (IQUAL) to eliminate applica tion perpendicular to the 
grain. 
2.  Johnson-Cook Like Logarithmic Rate Dependence.  A Johnson-Cook like 
logarithmic rate dependence can be invoked by IRATE  = 2 when the keyword 
option is unset and ITERS < 0. In that case, the st rength parameters are:

This is Material Type 145.  *MAT_145 is a Continuou s Surface Cap Model and is a three 
invariant extension of *MAT_GEOLOGIC_CAP_MODEL (*MA T_025) that includes 
viscoplasticity for rate eﬀects and damage mechanic s to model strain softening.  The 
primary references for the model are Schwer and Mur ray [1994], Schwer [1994], and 
Murray and Lewis [1994].  *MAT_145 was developed fo r geomaterials including soils, 
concrete, and rocks.  We recommend using an updated  version of a Continuous Surface 
Cap Model, *MAT_CSCM (*MAT_159), rather than this m odel, *MAT_SCHWER_MUR-
RAY_CAP_MODEL (*MAT_145).

 Remarks: 
1.  Damage Accumulation and Element Deletion. FAILFL controls whether the 
damage accumulation applies to either the total str ess tensor, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , or the devia- 
toric stress tensor, |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . When FAILFL = 2, damage does not diminish the abi lity 
of the material to support hydrostatic stress. 
FAILFL also serves as a ﬂag to control element dele tion.  Fully damaged ele- 
ments are deleted only if FAILFL is a positive valu e.  When *MAT_145 is used 
with the ALE or EFG solvers, failed elements should  not be eroded and so a 
negative value of FAILFL should be used. 
2.  History Variables. All the output parameters listed in Table M145-1  are 
available for post-processing using LS-PrePost and its displayed list of history 
variables.  The LS-DYNA input parameter NEIPH shoul d be set to 22 on

3.  Sample Input for Concrete.  Gran and Senseny [1996] report the axial stress as  
a function of strain response for twelve unconﬁned compression tests of con- 
crete, used in scale-model reinforced-concrete wall  tests.  The Schwer & Mur- 
ray Cap Model parameters provided below were used, see Schwer [2001], to 
model the unconﬁned compression test stress-strain response for the nominal 
40 MPa strength concrete reported by Gran and Sense ny.  The basic units for 
the provided parameters are length in millimeters ( mm), time in milliseconds 
(msec), and mass in grams (g).  This base unit set yields units of force in New- 
tons (N) and pressure in Mega-Pascals (MPa).

 *MAT_GAS_MIXTURE  
This is Material Type 148.  This model is for the s imulation of thermally equilibrated 
ideal gas mixtures.  This model only works with the  multi-material ALE formulation 
(ELFORM = 11 in *SECTION_SOLID).  This keyword must  be used together with *INI-
TIAL_GAS_MIXTURE for the initialization of gas dens ities and temperatures.  When 
applied in the context of ALE airbag modeling, the injection of inﬂator gas is done with 
a *SECTION_POINT_SOURCE_MIXTURE command which contr ols the injection 
process.  *MAT_ALE_GAS_MIXTURE (*MAT_ALE_02) is ide ntical to this model and is 
another name for this material model.

Remarks: 
1.  Methods for Deﬁning Gas Properties.   There are 2 methods of deﬁning the 
gas properties for the mixture.  If RUNIV is BLANK or ZERO, Method (A) is 
used to deﬁne constant heat capacities where per-ma ss unit values of |u1D436|u1D463Cst and 
|u1D436|u1D4JDCst are input.  Only Cards 2a.1 and 2a.2 are required for this method.  Method 
(B) is used to deﬁne constant or temperature depend ent heat capacities where 
per-mole unit values of |u1D436|u1D4JDCst are input.  Cards 2b.1 through 2b.4 are required f or 
this method. 
2.  Temperature Dependent Heat Capacity.   The per-mass-unit, temperature-
dependent, constant-pressure heat capacity is 
|u1D436|u1D4JDCst(|u1D447) =[CPmole + |u1D43J × |u1D447 + |u1D436 × |u1D447|twoCst]
MOLWT  
See Table M148-1 . 
3.  Initial Temperature and Density.   The initial temperature and the density of 
the gas species present in a mesh or part at time z ero is speciﬁed by the key-

4.  Temperature and Energy Conservation.  The ideal gas mixture is assumed 
to be thermal equilibrium, that is, all species are  at the same temperature ( |u1D447).  
The gases in the mixture are also assumed to follow  Dalton’s Partial Pressure 
Law, |u1D443 =∑ |u1D443|u1D4J6Cstngas 
|u1D4J6Cst.  The partial pressure of each gas is then |u1D443|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D7≠+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D44Jgas |u1D4J6Cst|u1D447 where 
|u1D44Jgas |u1D4J6Cst=|u1D44JCstuni v 
/u1D440.st/u1D44A.st .  The individual gas species temperature equals th e mixture tem- 
perature.  The temperature is computed from the int ernal energy where the 
mixture internal energy per unit volume  is used, 
|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst= |summationCv1 |u1D7≠+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cstsngas 
|u1D4J6Cst|u1D447|u1D4J6Cst= |summationCv1 |u1D7≠+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cstsngas 
|u1D4J6Cst|u1D447 
|u1D447 = |u1D447|u1D4J6Cst=|u1D4J2|u1D449Cst
∑ |u1D7≠+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D436|u1D449Cst|u1D4J6Cstsngas 
|u1D4J6Cst 
In general, the advection step conserves momentum  and internal energy , but not 
kinetic energy .  This can result in energy lost in the system and  lead to a pres- 
sure drop.  In *MAT_GAS_MIXTURE the dissipated kine tic energy is automat- 
ically converted into heat (internal energy).  Thus , in eﬀect the total energy is 
conserved instead of conserving just the internal e nergy.  This numerical 
scheme has been shown to improve accuracy in some c ases.  However, the user 
should always be vigilant and check the physics of the problem closely. 
5.  IADIAB.   As an example, consider an airbag surrounded by a mbient air.  As 
the inﬂator gas ﬂows into the bag, the ALE elements  cut by the airbag fabric 
shell elements will contain some inﬂator gas inside  and some ambient air out- 
side.  The multi-material element treatment is not perfect.  Consequently the 
temperature of the outside air may be made artiﬁcia lly high after the multi-
material element treatment.  To prevent the outside  ambient air from getting 
artiﬁcially high |u1D447, set IADIAB = 1 for the ambient air outside.  A si mple adia- 
batic compression equation is then assumed for the outside air.  The use of this 
ﬂag may be needed, but only when that air is modele d by the *MAT_GAS_-
MIXTURE card. 
Example: 
Consider a tank test model where the Lagrangian tan k (Part S1) is surrounded by an 
ALE air mesh (Part H4 = AMMGID 1).  There are 2 ALE  parts which are deﬁned but 
initially have no corresponding mesh: part 5 (H5 = AMMGID 2) is the resident gas 
inside the tank at |u1D461 = 0 , and part 6 (H6 = AMMGID 2) is the inﬂator gas(es)  which is 
injected into the tank when |u1D461 > 0 .  AMMGID stands for ALE Multi-Material Group ID.  
Please see the ﬁgure and input below.  The *MAT_GAS _MIXTURE input deﬁnes the 
gas properties of ALE parts H5 & H6.  The *MAT_GAS_ MIXTURE card input for both 
methods (A) and (B) are shown below. *MAT_148  *MAT_GAS_MIXTURE  
  
The *INITIAL_GAS_MIXTURE keyword input is also show n below.  It basically 
speciﬁes that “AMMGID 2 may be present in part or m esh H4 at |u1D461 = 0 , and the initial 
density of this gas is deﬁned in the rho1 position which corresponds to the 1 st  material 
in the mixture (or H5, the resident gas).”

This is  Material Type 153. This model has up to 10 back str ess terms for kinematic 
hardening combined with isotropic hardening and a d amage model for modeling low 
cycle fatigue and failure.  Huang [2009] originally  programmed this model with 3 back 
stress terms (KHFLG = 0) for solid, shell and beam elements.  It has since been updated 
to support implicit dynamics with up to 10 back str ess terms that can be automatically 
determined from cyclic strain-stress data (KHFLG > 0).  The updated model is available 
for solid and shell elements.  It may include tempe rature eﬀects.

Model Description: 
This model is based on the work of Lemaitre [1992],  and Dufailly and Lemaitre [1995].  
It is a pressure-independent plasticity model with the yield surface deﬁned by the 
function 
|u1D439 = |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt− |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= 0  , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst is uniaxial yield stress, 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCst+/u1D4:B
|u1D6FD|<racketleftCv11 − exp|parenleftCv1−|u1D6FD|u1D4JF|parenriµhtCv1|<racketriµhtCv1  . 
By setting |u1D6FD = 0 , a linear isotropic hardening is obtained 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCst+/u1D4:B |u1D4JF  , 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCst is the initial yield stress.  In the above, |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt is the equivalent von Mises stress, 
with respect to the deviatoric eﬀective stress, 
s|eCst= de v [σ/tilℂecomb.h1] −α=s−α   .  
Here /u1D42C is deviatoric stress and /u1D6C2 is the back stress, which is the sum of up to four  terms 
according to: 
α=|summationCv1α/∗.st
/∗.st  . 
σ/tilℂecomb.h1 is eﬀective stress (undamaged stress), based on Co ntinuum Damage Mechanics 
model [Lemaitre 1992], 
σ/tilℂecomb.h1=σ
1 − |u1D437  . 
Here |u1D437 is the isotropic damage scalar, which is bounded b y 0 and 1 
0 ≤ |u1D437 ≤ 1  . 
|u1D437 = 0  represents a damage-free material RVE (representat ive volume element), while 
|u1D437 = 1  represents a fully broken material RVE in two part s.  In fact, fracture occurs when 
|u1D437 = |u1D437|u1D4J≠Cst< 1, modeled as element removal.  The evolution of the  isotropic damage value 
related to ductile damage and fracture (the case wh ere the plastic strain or dissipation is 
much larger than the elastic one, [Lemaitre 1992]) is deﬁned as

and /u1D44C is strain energy density release rate: 
/u1D44C=1
2εel :/u1D40:el :εel   . 
Here /u1D40:el  represents the fourth-order elasticity tensor and εel  is elastic strain.  In the 
above, |u1D461 is a material constant, introduced by Dufailly and  Lemaitre [1995], to provide 
an additional degree of freedom for modeling low-cy cle fatigue ( |u1D461 = 1  in Lemaitre 
[1992]).  Dufailly and Lemaitre [1995] also propose d a simpliﬁed method to ﬁt 
experimental results and get |u1D446 and |u1D461. 
 
The equivalent Mises stress is deﬁned as 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt(s|u1D4J2Cst) =/radical.v53

Strain rate is accounted for using the Cowper and S ymonds model which scales the 
yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2

 Uniaxial cyclic tension and compression: 
This material can be used to model cyclic hardening  plasticity, including eﬀects known 
as plastic shakedown  and strain racheting . To understand how the plasticity parameters 
qualitatively inﬂuence the behavior in uniaxial ten sion and compression, we restrict 
ourselves to a discussion concerning linear isotrop ic hardening with initial yield |u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st and 
hardening modulus /u1D4:B. We also only include two kinematic hardening term s.  For the 
kinematic part, we use one linear term with hardeni ng |u1D436|zeroCst (and decay coeﬃcient |u1D6F∆|zeroCst= 0)  
and one combined term with hardening |u1D436 and decay coeﬃcient |u1D6F∆. The elastic Young’s 
modulus is denoted |u1D438, and we neglect any forms of temperature or rate e ﬀects. 
 
While this is merely an attempt to explain the phen omena, estimating the parameters 
that reﬂect the actual behavior of the physical mat erial may be diﬃcult.  Because of this, 
we recommend the ﬁtting options provided by KHFLG, where even the eﬀects of 
temperature can be accounted for. 
 
Strain induced deformation 
 
Consider the cyclic deformation depicted in Figure M153-1  in which the uniaxial strain 
ranges between |u1D7≠≠ and |u1D7≠≠̅. Two subsequent stress-strain cycles are shown.  
 
If the isotropic hardening modulus  /u1D4:B= 0, then the cycles are identical.  For nonzero 
hardening /u1D4:B, the stress level increases with each cycle and th e strain width indicated by 
|u1D7≠≠⃡ decreases.  As the yield surface expands, the isot ropic hardening eﬀect diminishes, 
and we tend towards a stable cycle; this phenomenon  is called plastic shakedown . 
 
If both /u1D4:B and |u1D436|zeroCst are zero, then the end of each cycle tends towards  ideal plastic since 
the presence of a nonzero |u1D6F∆ saturates the level of back stress and consequentl y the stress 
|u1D7≠∆ itself.  This physical phenomenon is unlikely.  Th erefore, we recommend having at 
least one linear kinematic hardening term present i n combination with some isotropic 
hardening for a realistic behavior. 
 
Stress induced deformation 
 
For stress induced deformation, we impose a cyclic stress between |u1D7≠∆ and |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt as shown in 
Figure M153-2  and investigate two subsequent stress-strain cycle s.  In this case a 
combination of isotropic hardening and nonlinear ki nematic hardening may cause a 
drift in strain.  This drift is referred to as ratcheting strain  and may be considered a creep 
phenomenon.  Even without the isotropic hardening /u1D4:B, a nonzero mean stress, 
(|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt+ |u1D7≠∆)/2, in the cycle causes a ratcheting eﬀect.  We again  recommend using 
combinations of isotropic, linear and nonlinear kin ematic hardening for accurate 
predictions of this creep behavior.

This is  Material Type 155.  An isotropic elastic-plastic ma terial where unique yield 
stress as a function of plastic strain curves can b e deﬁned for compression and tension.  
Also, failure can occur based on a plastic strain o r a minimum time step size.  Rate 
eﬀects on the yield stress are modeled either by us ing the Cowper-Symonds strain rate 
model or by using two load curves that scale the yi eld stress values in compression and 
tension, respectively.  Material rate eﬀects, which  are independent of the plasticity 
model, are based on a 6-term Prony series Maxwell m ode that generates an additional 
stress tensor.  The viscous stress tensor is superi mposed on the stress tensor generated 
by the plasticity.  Pressure is deﬁned by an equati on of state, which is required to utilize 
this model.  This model is applicable to solid elem ents and SPH.

Remarks: 
The eﬀective yield stress as a function of eﬀective  plastic strain behavior follows a 
diﬀerent curve in compression than it does in tensi on.  Tension is determined by the 
sign of the mean stress where a positive mean stres s (meaning a negative pressure) is 
indicative of tension.  Two curves must be deﬁned g iving the yield stress as a function 
of eﬀective plastic strain.  One curve is for the t ensile regime and the other curve is for 
the compressive regime. 
 
Mean stress is an invariant which can be expressed as |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D467Cst|parenriµhtCv2 3 ⁄. PC and PT 
deﬁne a range of mean stress values within which in terpolation is done between the 
tensile yield surface and compressive yield surface .  PC and PT are not true material 
properties but are just a numerical convenience so that the transition from one yield 
surface to the other is not as abrupt as the sign o f the mean stress changes.  Both PC, PT, 
PCUTC, and PCUTT may all be input as positive value s.  It is implied that PC and 
PCUTC are compressive values and that PT and PCUTT are tensile values.  The 
algebraic sign given these variables by the user is  inconsequential. 
 
Strain rate may be accounted for by using either tw o curves of yield stress scaling factor 
as a function of strain rate or a Cowper and Symond s model.  The two curves in the 
former approach are used directly, that is, the cur ves are not rediscretized before being 
used by the material model.   The Cowper and Symond s model scales the yield stress 
with the factor:

LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID: 
Load Curve.   When LC SS is a load curve ID, it is taken as 
deﬁning eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀective p lastic strain.  If 
deﬁned QR1, CR1, QR2, and CR2 are ignored. 
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the stress as a function of eﬀective plastic 
strain for that rate, See Figure M24-1 .  When the strain rate falls 
below the minimum value, the stress as a function o f eﬀective 
plastic strain curve for the lowes t value of strain rate is used.  
Likewise, when the strain rate exceeds the maximum value the 
stress as a function of eﬀective plastic strain cur ve for the highest 
value of strain rate is used.  
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   An alternative way to invok e 
logarithmic interpolation between discrete strain r ates is 
described as follows.  If the ﬁrst  value in the table is negative, LS-
DY NA assumes that all the table values represent the natural 
logarithm of a strain rate.  Since the tables are i nternally *MAT_ANISOTROPIC_ELASTIC_PLASTIC  *MAT_157  
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
discretized to equally space the table values, it ma kes good sense 
from an accuracy standpoint that the table values r epresent the 
natural log of strain rate when the lowest strain r ate and highest 
strain rate diﬀer by several orders of magnitude.  There i s some 
additional computational cost associated with invok ing 
logarithmic interpolation.

If these conditions are violated, then the stress t ensor will be reduced to zero 
over NCFAIL time steps and then the element gets er oded.  A small value for 
NCFAIL (< 50) is recommended to avoid unphysical be havior; the default is 
10. The default values for the strengths XT, XC, YT , YC, ZT, ZC, SXY, SYZ, and 
SZX are 10 20 , that is, basically no limits.  The scale factors FF12, FF23, and FF31 
for the interaction terms are zero by default.  
4.  Tsai-Hill failure criterion (EXTRA = 2).   Brittle failure with diﬀerent strengths

If these conditions are violated, then the stress t ensor will be reduced to zero 
over NCFAIL time steps and the element will be erod ed.  A small value for 
NCFAIL (< 50) is recommended to avoid unphysical be havior; the default is 
10. The default values for the strengths XT, XC, YT , YC, ZT, ZC, SXY, SYZ, and

 Converting Moldﬂow Results into LS-Dyna Keyword For mat: 
Starting in LS-PrePost 4.6, a feature has been adde d to map Moldﬂow results for short 
ﬁber reinforced composite injection molding to the LS-DYNA keyword format.  This 
feature reads in the results from Moldﬂow, maps the  results to the LS-DYNA mesh, and 
calculates the anisotropic elasticity tensor /u1D450|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  for structure analysis using this keyword 
with *INITIAL_STRESS_SHELL keyword card.  This feat ure can only be used with shell 
LS-DYNA elements.   
 
To convert the Moldﬂow results, the udm  format of the Moldﬂow solid mesh and the 
xml  format of the ﬁber orientation result from the mol ding simulation are required.  
These ﬁles are mapped onto the LS-DYNA shell mesh. 
 
LS-PrePost obtains the spatially varying /u1D450|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  for this keyword using a two-step process.  
First, the elastic properties of the homogenized un idirectional ﬁber reinforced 
composite are calculated from the Young’s modulus a nd the Poisson ratio of the ﬁber 
 Figure M157-1.   Moldﬂow conversion dialog box. *MAT_157  *MAT_ANISOTROPIC_ELASTIC_PLASTIC  
 and matrix, the ﬁber volume fraction, and the ﬁber aspect ratio.  Two diﬀerent methods 
may be used for this process: the Halpin-Tsai and M ori-Tanaka [ 2,3].  Next, an 
orientation averaging is carried out to get the /u1D450|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  for the non-aligned short ﬁber 
reinforced composite from the Moldﬂow simulation re sults and the user-deﬁned (UD) 
composite elastic properties computed in the ﬁrst s tep [ 1].  Two methods, linear and 
quadratic, are implemented for the orientation aver aging process as well as two hybrid 
methods based on the linear and quadratic methods.  The anisotropic elasticity tensor is 
calculated at each integration point for the LS-DYN A structural analysis mesh and is 
written out in an *INITIAL_STRESS_SHELL card.   
 
The procedure for creating the LS-DYNA keyword ﬁle from the Moldﬂow results are as 
follows: 
1.  Click on Misc.  → Moldﬂow  in the top toolbar to open the Moldﬂow conversion 
window.  Figure M157-1  shows this window. 
2.  Click the Browse  button under Dyna Mesh File  to import the part that requires 
the Moldﬂow results. 
3.  Import the udm  and xml  ﬁles under the Moldﬂow Result Files . 
4.  Change the Material Properties  as needed.  The meaning of each material 
property listed in LS-PrePost is described in the f ollowing table. 
 
Name Description 
Ef Young’s modulus of ﬁber 
Nuf Poisson ratio of ﬁber 
Em Young’s Modulus of matrix 
Num Poisson ratio of matrix 
Vf volume fraction of ﬁber 
Ratio aspect ratio of short ﬁber 
 
5.  Select the method for calculating the elastic prop erties from the methods 
shown in the UD composite  dropdown menu. 
6.  Select the averaging method from the Averaging  dropdown menu.  
7.  Input the number of through-thickness integration points per element in the 
Target IPs .  The results will be output for each integration point.  LS-PrePost 
will automatically select the location of the integ ration points based on the 
number input. *MAT_ANISOTROPIC_ELASTIC_PLASTIC  *MAT_157  
 8.  The Pick Parts  section is used to select which parts of the Moldﬂ ow mesh is 
being mapped to the LS-Dyna parts.  When selecting the From , select the ap- 
propriate Moldﬂow part.  For the To , select the appropriate LS-DYNA part. 
9.  The Pick Segments  provides an orientation for the mapping onto the L S-DYNA 
part.  Just select two diﬀerent sides for Side1  and Side2  of the LS-DYNA part. 
10.  Then select Map  to make the conversion based on the above inputs. 
11.  After mapping.  the results can be output using th e Save *INITIAL to  section 
which saves the results so that they can be used fo r LS-DYNA calculations.

This is  Material Type 158.  Depending on the type of failur e surface, this model may be 
used to model rate sensitive composite materials wi th unidirectional layers, complete 
laminates, and woven fabrics.  A viscous stress ten sor, based on an isotropic Maxwell 
model with up to six terms in the Prony series expa nsion, is superimposed on the rate 
independent stress tensor of the composite fabric.  The viscous stress tensor approach 
should work reasonably well if the stress increases  due to rate aﬀects are up to 15% of 
the total stress.  This model is implemented for bo th shell and thick shell elements.  The 
viscous stress tensor is eﬀective at eliminating sp urious stress oscillations.

2.  Rate Effects.   Rate eﬀects are taken into account through a Maxw ell model 
using linear viscoelasticity by a convolution integ ral of the form:

where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst(|u1D461Cst−/u1D̅0F.st) is the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent stres s measures.  
This stress is added to the stress tensor determine d from the strain energy 
functional.  Since we wish to include only simple r ate eﬀects, the relaxation 
function is represented by six terms from the Prony  series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
We characterize this in the input by the shear modu li, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and decay constants, 
|u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.  An arbitrary number of terms, not exceeding 6, m ay be used when apply- 
ing the viscoelastic model.  The composite failure is not directly aﬀected by the 
presence of the viscous stress tensor. *MAT_CSCM  *MAT_159

Remarks: 
1.  Model Overview.   This is a cap model with a smooth intersection be tween the 
shear yield surface and hardening cap, as shown in Figure M159-1 .  The initial 
damage surface coincides with the yield surface.  R ate eﬀects are modeled with 
viscoplasticity.  For a complete theoretical descri ption, with references and 
example problems see [Murray 2007] and [Murray, Abu -Odeh and Bligh 2007]. 
2.  Stress Invariants.   The yield surface is formulated in terms of three  stress 
invariants: /u1D4:D|oneCst which is the ﬁrst invariant of the stress tensor, /u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst which is the 
second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, a nd /u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst which is the third invar- 
iant of the deviatoric stress tensor.  The invarian ts are deﬁned in terms of the 
deviatoric stress tensor,  |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , and pressure, |u1D443, as follows: *MAT_159  *MAT_CSCM  
 /u1D4:D|oneCst= 3|u1D443
/u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst=1
2|u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst 
/u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst=1
3|u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J8Cst |u1D446|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J6Cst  
3.  Plasticity Surface.   The three invariant yield function is based on th ese three 
invariants, and the cap hardening parameter, /u1D̅05, as follows: 
|u1D4J3 |parenleftCv1/u1D4:D|oneCst,/u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst,/u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst,/u1D̅05|parenriµhtCv1 =/u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst−ℜ|twoCst|u1D439/u1D45:.st|twoCst|u1D439|u1D4J≠Cst . 
Here |u1D439/f.st is the shear failure surface, |u1D439/c.st is the hardening cap, and ℜ is the Rubin 
three-invariant reduction factor.  The cap hardenin g parameter /u1D̅05  is the value 
of the pressure invariant at the intersection of th e cap and shear surfaces. 
Trial elastic stress invariants are temporarily upd ated using the trial elastic 
stress tensor, /u1D̅48|u1D447Cst.  These are denoted /u1D4:D|oneCst|u1D447Cst, /u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst|u1D447Cst, and /u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst|u1D447Cst.  Elastic stress states are 
modeled when |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv2/u1D4:D|oneCst|u1D447Cst,/u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst|u1D447Cst,/u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst|u1D447Cst,/u1D̅05|u1D447Cst|parenriµhtCv2 ≤ 0 .  Elastic-plastic stress states are modeled 
when |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv2/u1D4:D|oneCst|u1D447Cst,/u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst|u1D447Cst,/u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst|u1D447Cst,/u1D̅05|u1D447Cst|parenriµhtCv2 ≤ 0.   In this case, the plasticity algorithm returns th e 
stress state to the yield surface such that |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv2/u1D4:D|oneCst|u1D443Cst,/u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst|u1D443Cst,/u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst|u1D443Cst,/u1D̅05|u1D443Cst|parenriµhtCv2 = 0.   This is accom- 
plished by enforcing the plastic consistency condit ion with associated ﬂow. 
4.  Shear Failure Surface.   The strength of concrete is modeled by the shear 
surface in the tensile and low conﬁning pressure re gimes: 
|u1D439/u1D45:.st(/u1D4:D|oneCst) = |u1D6F+ − |u1D7≠6 exp|parenleftCv1−|u1D6FD/u1D4:D|oneCst|parenriµhtCv1 +/u1D̅0:/u1D4:D|oneCst  . 
Here the values of |u1D6F+, |u1D6FD, |u1D7≠6, and /u1D̅0: are selected by ﬁtting the model surface to 
strength measurements from triaxial compression (TX C) tests conducted on 
plain concrete cylinders.

 5.  Rubin Scaling Function.   Concrete fails at lower values of /radical.v23/u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst (principal 
stress diﬀerence) for triaxial extension (TXE) and torsion (TOR) tests than it 
does for TXC tests conducted at the same pressure.  The Rubin scaling func- 
tion, ℜ, determines the strength of concrete for any state  of stress relative to the 
strength for TXC, using ℜ|u1D439/f.st.  Strength in torsion is modeled as |u1D444|oneCst|u1D439/f.st.  Strength 
in TXE is modeled as |u1D444|twoCst|u1D439/f.st, where:  
|u1D444|oneCst= |u1D6F+|oneCst− |u1D7≠6|oneCstexp|parenleftCv1−|u1D6FD|oneCst/u1D4:D|oneCst|parenriµhtCv1 +/u1D̅0:|oneCst/u1D4:D|oneCst
|u1D444|twoCst= |u1D6F+|twoCst− |u1D7≠6|twoCstexp|parenleftCv1−|u1D6FD|twoCst/u1D4:D|oneCst|parenriµhtCv1 +/u1D̅0:|twoCst/u1D4:D|oneCst 
6.  Cap Hardening Surface.   The strength of concrete is modeled by a combina-
tion of the cap and shear surfaces in the low to hi gh conﬁning pressure re- 
gimes.  The cap is used to model plastic volume cha nge related to pore collapse 
(although the pores are not explicitly modeled).  T he isotropic hardening cap is 
a two-part function that is either unity or an elli pse: 
|u1D439|u1D4J≠Cst( /u1D4:D|oneCst,/u1D̅05 ) = 1 −[/u1D4:D|oneCst−/u1D4:F (/u1D̅05)][ |/u1D4:D|oneCst−/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05)| +/u1D4:D|oneCst−/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) ]
2  [/u1D44B(/u1D̅05) −/u1D4:F (/u1D̅05)] |twoCst  , 
where /u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) is deﬁned as: 
/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) = |<raceleftCvJ/u1D̅05 if    /u1D̅05>/u1D̅05|zeroCst
/u1D̅05|zeroCstotherwise  
The equation for |u1D439|u1D4J≠Cst is equal to unity for /u1D4:D|oneCst≤/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05).  It describes the ellipse for 
/u1D4:D|oneCst>/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05). The intersection of the shear surface and the cap  is at /u1D4:D|oneCst=/u1D̅05.  /u1D̅05|zeroCst is the 
value of /u1D4:D|oneCst at the initial  intersection of the cap and shear surfaces before hard- 
ening is engaged (before the cap moves).  The equat ion for /u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) restrains the 
cap from retracting past its initial location at /u1D̅05|zeroCst. 
The intersection of the cap with the /u1D4:D|oneCst axis is at /u1D4:D|oneCst=/u1D44B(/u1D̅05).  This intersection 
depends upon the cap ellipticity ratio |u1D44J, where |u1D44J is the ratio of its major to 
minor axes: 
/u1D44B(/u1D̅05) =/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05) + |u1D44J|u1D439/u1D45:.st[/u1D4:F(/u1D̅05)] . 
The cap moves to simulate plastic volume change.  T he cap expands ( /u1D44B(/u1D̅05) and 
/u1D̅05 increase) to simulate plastic volume compaction.  The cap contracts ( /u1D44B(/u1D̅05) 
and /u1D̅05 decrease) to simulate plastic volume expansion, ca lled dilation.   The 
motion (expansion and contraction) of the cap is ba sed upon the hardening 
rule: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst|u1D4JDCst=/u1D44A/˙racketleft.v:1 − |u1D4J2−/u1D4:̅.st|oneCsts(/u1D44B.st−/u1D44B.st|zeroCsts)−/u1D4:̅.st|twoCsts(/u1D44B.st−/u1D44B.st|zeroCsts)|twoCsts/˙racketright.v:  . 
Here |u1D7≠≠|u1D463Cst|u1D4JDCst is the plastic volume strain, /u1D44A is the maximum plastic volume strain, 
and |u1D437|oneCst and |u1D437|twoCst are model input parameters.  /u1D44B|zeroCst is the initial location of the cap 
when /u1D̅05=/u1D̅05|zeroCst. 
The ﬁve input parameters ( /u1D44B|zeroCst, /u1D44A, |u1D437|oneCst, |u1D437|twoCst, and |u1D44J) are obtained from ﬁts to the 
pressure-volumetric strain curves in isotropic comp ression and uniaxial strain. *MAT_159  *MAT_CSCM  
 /u1D44B|zeroCst determines the pressure at which compaction initia tes in isotropic compres- 
sion. |u1D44J, combined with /u1D44B|zeroCst, determines the pressure at which compaction initi - 
ates in uniaxial strain. |u1D437|oneCst and |u1D437|twoCst determine the shape of the pressure-
volumetric strain curves.  /u1D44A determines the maximum plastic volume compac- 
tion. 
7.  Shear Hardening Surface.  In unconﬁned compression, the stress-strain 
behavior of concrete exhibits nonlinearity and dila tion prior to the peak.  Such 
behavior is modeled with an initial shear yield sur face, /u1D441|u1D43BCst|u1D439/f.st, which hardens 
until it coincides with the ultimate shear yield su rface, |u1D439/f.st. Two input parame- 
ters are required.  One parameter, /u1D441|u1D43BCst, initiates hardening by setting the loca- 
tion of the initial yield surface.  A second parame ter, |u1D436|u1D43BCst, determines the rate of 
hardening (amount of nonlinearity). 
8.  Damage.   Concrete exhibits softening in the tensile and lo w to moderate 
compressive regimes. 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /d.st= (1 − |u1D4J1)|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |vCst /p.st  
A scalar damage parameter, |u1D4J1, transforms the viscoplastic stress tensor without  
damage, denoted |u1D7≠∆v p , into the stress tensor with damage, denoted |u1D7≠∆d. Damage 
accumulation is based upon two distinct formulation s, which we call brittle 
damage and ductile damage.  The initial damage thre shold is coincident with 
the shear plasticity surface, so the threshold does  not have to be speciﬁed by 
the user. 
a)  Ductile Damage.   Ductile damage accumulates when the pressure, |u1D443, is 
compressive and an energy-type term, /u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst, exceeds the damage threshold, 
/u1D̅0F|zeroCst|u1D4J≠Cst. Ductile damage accumulation depends upon the tota l strain compo- 
nents, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , as follows: 
/u1D̅0F/c.st=  /radical.v51
2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   
The stress components, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  are the elasto-plastic stresses (with kinematic 
hardening) calculated before application of damage and rate eﬀects. 
b)  Brittle Damage.   Brittle damage accumulates when the pressure is t ensile 
and an energy-type term, /u1D̅0F|u1D461Cst, exceeds the damage threshold, /u1D̅0F|zeroCst|u1D461Cst.  Brittle 
damage accumulation depends upon the maximum princi pal strain, |u1D7≠≠max , 
as follows: 
/u1D̅0F|tCst=/radical.v2|u1D438|u1D7≠≠max |twoCst  . 
As damage accumulates, the damage parameter, |u1D4J1, increases from an initial 
value of zero, towards a maximum value of one, usin g the following formula- 
tions: *MAT_CSCM  *MAT_159

maximum of the brittle or ductile damage parameter.   The parameters |u1D434 and |u1D43J 
or |u1D436 and |u1D437 set the shape of the softening curve plotted as st ress-displacement 
or stress-strain.   The parameter |u1D4J1max  is the maximum damage level that can be 
attained.  It is internally calculated and is less than one at moderate conﬁning 
pressures.  See [Murray 2007] for a description of how |u1D4J1max  is calculated for 
diﬀerent loading regimes.  The compressive softenin g parameter, |u1D434, may also 
be reduced with conﬁnement, using the input ﬁeld PM OD, as follows: 
|u1D434 = |u1D434(|u1D4J1max + 0.001)PMOD  
9.  Regulating Mesh Size Sensitivity.   The concrete model maintains constant 
fracture energy, regardless of element size.  The f racture energy is deﬁned here 
as the area under the stress-displacement curve fro m peak strength to zero 
strength.  This is done by internally formulating t he softening parameters |u1D434 
and |u1D436 (see Remark 8 ) in terms of the element length,  /u1D45∫ (cube root of the element 
volume), the fracture energy, |u1D43A/f.st, the initial damage threshold, /u1D̅0F|zeroCst|u1D461Cst or /u1D̅0F|zeroCst|u1D4J≠Cst, and 
the softening shape parameters, |u1D437 or |u1D43J. 
The fracture energy is calculated from up to ﬁve us er-speciﬁed input ﬁelds: 
GFC, GFS, GFT, PWRC, and PWRT.  The user speciﬁes t hree distinct fracture 
energy values.  These are the fracture energy in un iaxial tensile stress, GFT; 
pure shear stress, GFS; and uniaxial compressive st ress, GFC.  The model in- 
ternally selects the fracture energy from equations  which interpolate between 
the three fracture energy values as a function of t he stress state (expressed us- 
ing two stress invariants).  The interpolation equa tions depend upon the user-
speciﬁed input powers PWRC and PWRT, as follows:

[GFC − GFS] 
The internal parameters /u1D458|u1D4J≠Cst and /u1D458|u1D461Cst are restricted to the interval [0,1] . 
10.  Element Erosion.   An element loses all strength and stiﬀness as |u1D4J1→1.  To 
prevent computational diﬃculties with very low stiﬀ ness, element erosion is *MAT_159  *MAT_CSCM  
 available as a user option.  An element erodes when  |u1D4J1 > 0.99 and the maxi- 
mum principal strain is greater than a user supplie d input value, ERODE − 1.0 . 
11.  Viscoplastic Rate Effects.   At each time step, the viscoplastic algorithm 
interpolates between the elastic trial stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /ε.st, and the inviscid stress (without 
rate eﬀects), |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /p.st, to set the viscoplastic stress (with rate eﬀects),  |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |vCst /p.st : 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |vCst /p.st = (1 − |u1D6F∆)|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /ε.st+ |u1D6F∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /p.st , 
where 
|u1D6F∆ =∆|u1D461/|u1D7≠2
1 + ∆|u1D461/|u1D7≠2  . 
This interpolation depends upon the eﬀective ﬂuidit y coeﬃcient, |u1D7≠2, and the 
time step, ∆|u1D461.  The eﬀective ﬂuidity coeﬃcient is internally cal culated from ﬁve 
user-supplied input parameters and interpolation eq uations: 
Tensile Pressure :|u1D7≠2 = |u1D7≠2|u1D46≠Cst +
⎝⎜⎜⎜⎛−/u1D4:D|oneCst

|<racketleftCv1|u1D7≠2|u1D4J≠Cst− |u1D7≠2|u1D46≠Cst|<racketriµhtCv1 
where 
|u1D7≠2|u1D46≠Cst= SRATE × |u1D7≠2|u1D461Cst
|u1D7≠2|u1D461Cst=ETA0T 
|u1D7≠≠̇NT 
|u1D7≠2|u1D4J≠Cst=ETA0C 
|u1D7≠≠̇NC  
The input parameters are ETA0T   and NT for ﬁtting uniaxial tensile stress data, 
ETA0X and NC  for ﬁtting the uniaxial compressive stress data, an d SRATE  for 
ﬁtting shear stress data.  The eﬀective strain rate  is |u1D7≠≠̇. 
This viscoplastic model may predict substantial rat e eﬀects at high strain rates 
(|u1D7≠≠̇ > 100).  To limit rate eﬀects at high strain rates , the user may input overstress 
limits in tension OVERT and compression OVERC.  The se input ﬁelds limit 
calculation of the ﬂuidity parameter, as follows: 
if |u1D438|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D7≠2 > O V ER,  then |u1D7≠2 =|u1D4JA
|u1D438|u1D7≠≠̇  . 
Here |u1D4JA = OVERT when the pressure is tensile and |u1D4JA = OVERC when the pres- 
sure is compressive. 
The user has the option of increasing the fracture energy as a function of eﬀec- 
tive strain rate using the REPOW input parameter, a s follows: *MAT_CSCM  *MAT_159  
 |u1D43A/u1D45:.st/r.st|aCst|tCst|eCst = |u1D43A/u1D45:.st⎣⎢⎡1 +|u1D438|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D7≠2
|u1D4JF|u1D46≠Cst/radical.v1|u1D438⎦⎥⎤REPOW 
 
Here |u1D43A/f.st/r.st|aCst|tCst|eCst  is the fracture energy enhanced by rate eﬀects, an d |u1D4JF|u1D46≠Cst is an internally 
calculated damage threshold determined before apply ing viscoplasticity (see 
[Murray 2007] for more details).  The term in brack ets is only applied if it is 
greater than or equal to one and is the approximate  ratio of the dynamic to 
static strength. *MAT_160  *MAT_ALE_INCOMPRESSIBLE  
 *MAT_ALE_INCOMPRESSIBLE  
This is Material Type 160. This material is for mod eling incompressible ﬂows with the 
ALE solver.  It should be used with solid element f ormulations 6 or 12 (see *SECTION_-

These are  Material Types 161 and 162.  These models may be us ed to model the 
progressive failure analysis for composite material s consisting of unidirectional and 
woven fabric layers.  The progressive layer failure  criteria have been established by 
adopting the methodology developed by Hashin [1980]  with a generalization to include 
the eﬀect of highly constrained pressure on composi te failure.  These failure models can 
be used to eﬀectively simulate ﬁber failure, matrix  damage, and delamination behavior 
under all conditions - opening, closing, and slidin g of failure surfaces.  The model with 
the DMG keyword option (material 162) is a generali zation of the basic layer failure 
model of Material 161 by adopting the damage mechan ics approach for characterizing 
the softening behavior after damage initiation.  Th ese models require an additional 
license from Materials Sciences Corporation, which developed and supports these 
models.

Material Models: 
The unidirectional and fabric layer failure criteri a and the associated property 
degradation models for material 161 are described a s follows.  All the failure criteria are 
expressed in terms of stress components based on pl y level stresses 
(|u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst,/u1D̅0F|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst ,/u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst ,/u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst ) and the associated elastic moduli are (|u1D438|u1D44∆Cst, |u1D438|u1D44FCst, |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst, |u1D43A|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst , |u1D43A|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst , |u1D43A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst ).  
Note that for the unidirectional model, |u1D44∆, |u1D44F and /u1D450 denote the ﬁber, in-plane transverse *MAT_161-162  *MAT_COMPOSITE_MSC  
 and out-of-plane directions, respectively, while fo r the fabric model, |u1D44∆, |u1D44F and /u1D450 denote 
the in-plane ﬁll, in-plane warp and out-of-plane di rections, respectively. 
Unidirectional Lamina Model: 
Three criteria are used for ﬁber failure, one in te nsion/shear, one in compression and 
another one in crush under pressure.  They are chos en in terms of quadratic stress 
forms as follows:

Here ⟨ ⟩ are Macaulay brackets, |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst  and |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst /u1D4:6.st  are the tensile and compressive strengths

shear and crush failure, respectively. 
 
Matrix mode failures must occur without ﬁber failur e, and hence they will be on planes 
parallel to ﬁbers.  For simplicity, only two failur e planes are considered: one is 
perpendicular to the planes of layering and the oth er one is parallel to them.  The matrix 
failure criteria for the failure plane perpendicula r and parallel to the layering planes, 
respectively, have the forms:

Here |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D447Cst  is the transverse tensile strength.  Based on the Coulomb-Mohr theory, the

|u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst (|zeroCst)and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst)are the shear strength values of the corresponding tensile modes. 
 
Failure predicted by the criterion of |u1D4J3|fourCst can be referred to as transverse matrix failure, 
while the matrix failure predicted by |u1D4J3|fiveCst, which is parallel to the layer, can be referred a s 
the delamination mode when it occurs within the ele ments that are adjacent to the ply 
interface.  Note that a scale factor |u1D446 is introduced to provide better correlation of 
delamination area with experiments.  The scale fact or |u1D446 can be determined by ﬁtting the 
analytical prediction to experimental data for the delamination area. 
 
When ﬁber failure in tension/shear mode is predicte d in a layer by |u1D4J3|oneCst, the load carrying 
capacity of that layer is completely eliminated.  A ll the stress components are reduced 
to zero instantaneously (100 time steps to avoid nu merical instability).  For compressive 
ﬁber failure, the layer is assumed to carry a resid ual axial load, while the transverse 
load carrying capacity is reduced to zero.  When th e ﬁber compressive failure mode is 
reached due to |u1D4J3|twoCst, the axial layer compressive strength stress is as sumed to reduce to a 
residual value |u1D446|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  (= SFFC × |u1D446|u1D434Cst /u1D4:6.st ).  The axial stress is then assumed to remain cons tant, 
meaning |u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst =  −|u1D446|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st , for continuous compressive loading, while the sub sequent 
unloading curve follows a reduced axial modulus to zero axial stress and strain state.  
When the ﬁber crush failure occurs, the material is  assumed to behave elastically for 
compressive pressure, |u1D4JD > 0 , and to carry no load for tensile pressure, |u1D4JD < 0 . 
 
When a matrix failure (delamination) in the |u1D44∆|u1D44F -plane is predicted, the strength values 
for |u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst (|zeroCst)and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst) are set to zero.  This results in reducing the str ess components |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst, /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  
and /u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst  to the fractured material strength surface.  For te nsile mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst> 0, these stress 
components are reduced to zero.  For compressive mo de, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst< 0, the normal stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst is 
assumed to deform elastically for the closed matrix  crack.  Loading on the failure 
envelop, the shear stresses are assumed to ‘slide’ on the fractured strength surface 
(frictional shear stresses) like in an ideal plasti c material, while the subsequent 
unloading shear stress-strain path follows reduced shear moduli to the zero shear stress 
and strain state for both /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  and /u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst  components. 
 
The post failure behavior for the matrix crack in t he a-c plane due to |u1D4J3|fourCst is modeled in the 
same fashion as that in the |u1D44∆|u1D44F -plane as described above.  In this case, when fail ure 
occurs, |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst (|zeroCst) and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst)are reduced to zero instantaneously.  The post frac ture response is 
then governed by failure criterion of |u1D4J3|fiveCst with |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst (|zeroCst)= 0 and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst)= 0.  For tensile mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst>
0, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst, /u1D̅0F|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst  and /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  are zero.  For compressive mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst< 0, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst is assumed to be elastic, 
while /u1D̅0F|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst  and /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  ‘slide’ on the fracture strength surface as in an ideal plastic material, *MAT_161-162  *MAT_COMPOSITE_MSC  
 and the unloading path follows reduced shear moduli  to the zero shear stress and strain 
state.  It should be noted that /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  is governed by both the failure functions and shou ld 
lie within or on each of these two strength surface s. 
Fabric Lamina Model: 
The ﬁber failure criteria of Hashin for a unidirect ional layer are generalized to 
characterize the ﬁber damage in terms of strain com ponents for a plain weave layer.

where |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D447Cst  are the axial tensile strengths in the ﬁll and war p directions, 
respectively, and |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D439Cst /u1D446.st  and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D439Cst /u1D446.st  are the layer shear strengths due to ﬁber shear fa ilure in 
the ﬁll and warp directions.  These failure criteri a are applicable when the associated |u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst 
or |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst is positive.  It is assumed |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D439Cst /u1D446.st  = SFS, and 
|u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D439Cst /u1D446.st  = SFS ×|u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D447Cst

When |u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst or |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCstis compressive, it is assumed that the in-plane com pressive failure in both

where |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst /u1D4:6.st and |u1D446|u1D44FCst /u1D4:6.st  are the axial compressive strengths in the ﬁll and  warp directions,

3  . 
A plain weave layer can fail under in-plane shear s tress without the occurrence of ﬁber 
breakage.  This in-plane matrix failure mode is giv en by 
|u1D4J3|oneCst|oneCst = |parenleftCvJ/u1D̅0F|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst 
|u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst |parenriµhtCvJ|twoCst

where |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst  is the layer shear strength due to matrix shear fa ilure. 
 *MAT_COMPOSITE_MSC  *MAT_161-162  
 Another failure mode, which is due to the quadratic  interaction between the thickness 
stresses, is expected to be mainly a matrix failure .  This through the thickness matrix 
failure criterion is 
|u1D4J3|oneCst|twoCst  =  |u1D446|twoCst/˙raceleft.v6|parenleftCvJ⟨|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst⟩

/˙raceright.v6− 1 = 0  , 
where |u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D447Cst  is the through the thickness tensile strength, and  |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  and |u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst  are the shear 
strengths assumed to depend on the compressive norm al stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst, meaning 
|<raceleftCvJ|u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst 
|u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst |<raceriµhtCvJ =/˙raceleft.v6|u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst (|zeroCst)

When failure predicted by this criterion occurs wit hin elements that are adjacent to the 
ply interface, the failure plane is expected to be parallel to the layering planes, and, 
thus, can be referred to as the delamination mode.  Note that a scale factor |u1D446 is 
introduced to provide better correlation of delamin ation area with experiments.  The 
scale factor |u1D446 can be determined by ﬁtting the analytical predict ion to experimental data 
for the delamination area. 
 
Similar to the unidirectional model, when ﬁber tens ile/shear failure is predicted in a 
layer by |u1D4J3|sixCst or |u1D4J3|sevenCst, the load carrying capacity of that layer in the a ssociated direction is 
completely eliminated.  For compressive ﬁber failur e due to by |u1D4J3/eight.st or |u1D4J3/nine.st, the layer is 
assumed to carry a residual axial load in the faile d direction, while the load carrying 
capacity transverse to the failed direction is assu med unchanged.  When the 
compressive axial stress in a layer reaches the com pressive axial strength |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst /u1D4:6.st  or |u1D446|u1D44FCst /u1D4:6.st , the 
axial layer stress is assumed to be reduced to the residual strength |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  or |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  where 
|u1D446|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  =  SFFC × |u1D446|u1D44∆Cst /u1D4:6.st  and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D44JCst /u1D4:6.st  =  SFFC × |u1D446|u1D44FCst /u1D4:6.st .  The axial stress is assumed to remain 
constant, that is, |u1D7≠∆|u1D44∆Cst =  −|u1D446|u1D44∆Cst /u1D4:6.st |u1D44JCst  or |u1D7≠∆|u1D44FCst =  −|u1D446|u1D44FCst /u1D4:6.st |u1D44JCst , for continuous compressive loading, 
while the subsequent unloading curve follows a redu ced axial modulus.  When the ﬁber 
crush failure is occurred, the material is assumed to behave elastically for compressive 
pressure, |u1D4JD > 0 , and to carry no load for tensile pressure,  |u1D4JD < 0 . 
 
When the in-plane matrix shear failure is predicted  by |u1D4J3|oneCst|oneCst  the axial load carrying 
capacity within a failed element is assumed unchang ed, while the in-plane shear stress 
is assumed to be reduced to zero. 
 
For through the thickness matrix (delamination) fai lure given by equation |u1D4J3|oneCst|twoCst , the in-
plane load carrying capacity within the element is assumed to be elastic, while the 
strength values for the tensile mode, |u1D446|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst (|zeroCst) and |u1D446|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst (|zeroCst), are set to zero.  For tensile mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst>
0, the through the thickness stress components are r educed to zero.  For compressive 
mode, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst< 0, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst is assumed to be elastic, while /u1D̅0F|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  and /u1D̅0F|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst  ‘slide’ on the fracture 
strength surface as in an ideal plastic material, a nd the unloading path follows reduced 
shear moduli to the zero shear stress and strain st ate.

Damage Model: 
The damage model is a generalization of the layer f ailure model of Material 161 by 
adopting the MLT damage mechanics approach, Matzenm iller et al.  [1995], for 
characterizing the softening behavior after damage initiation.  Complete model 
description is given in Yen [2002].  The damage fun ctions, which are expressed in terms 
of ply level engineering strains, are converted fro m the above failure criteria of ﬁber 
and matrix failure modes by neglecting the Poisson’ s eﬀect.  Elastic moduli reduction is 
expressed in terms of the associated damage paramet ers /u1Dℜ1B|u1D4J6Cst: 
|u1D438|u1D4J6Cst|minuteCst= (1 −/u1Dℜ1B|u1D4J6Cst)|u1D438|u1D4J6Cst

In the above |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst are the initial elastic moduli, |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst|minuteCst are the reduced elastic moduli, |u1D4JF|u1D4J6Cst are the 
damage thresholds computed from the associated dama ge functions for ﬁber damage, 
matrix damage and delamination, and |u1D4JA|u1D4J6Cst are material damage parameters, which are 
currently assumed to be independent of strain-rate.   The damage function is formulated 
to account for the overall nonlinear elastic respon se of a lamina including the initial 
‘hardening’ and the subsequent softening beyond the  ultimate strengths.  
In the damage model (material 162), the eﬀect of st rain-rate on the nonlinear stress-
strain response of a composite layer is modeled by the strain-rate dependent functions

Element Erosion: 
A failed element is eroded in any of three diﬀerent  ways: 
1.  If ﬁber tensile failure in a unidirectional layer is predicted in the element and 
the axial tensile strain is greater than E_LIMT.  F or a fabric layer, both in-plane 
directions are failed and exceed E_LIMT. 
2.  If compressive relative volume in a failed element  is smaller than ECRSH. 
3.  If tensile relative volume in a failed element is greater than EEXPN.

stress as a function of volumetric strain where |u1D449 is the relative volume. *MAT_163  *MAT_MODIFIED_CRUSHABLE_FOAM  
 This material is an extension of material 63, *MAT_ CRUSHABLE_FOAM.  It allows the 
yield stress to be a function of both volumetric st rain rate and volumetric strain.  Rate 
eﬀects are accounted for by deﬁning a table of curv es using *DEFINE_TABLE.  Each 
curve deﬁnes the yield stress as a function volumet ric strain for a diﬀerent strain rate.  
The yield stress is obtained by interpolating betwe en the two curves that bound the 
strain rate. 
 
To prevent high frequency oscillations in the strai n rate from causing similar high 
frequency oscillations in the yield stress, a modiﬁ ed volumetric strain rate is used when 
interpolating to obtain the yield stress.  The modi ﬁed strain rate is obtained as follows.  
If NYCLE is > 1, then the modiﬁed strain rate is ob tained by a time average of the actual 
strain rate over NCYCLE solution cycles.  For SRCLM T > 0, the modiﬁed strain rate is 
capped so that during each cycle, the modiﬁed strai n rate is not permitted to change 
more than SRCLMT multiplied by the solution time st ep. *MAT_BRAIN_LINEAR_VISCOELASTIC  *MAT_164

|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCst+/u1D4:B|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst  .

where |u1D4JB is the ﬂow direction.  The term, |u1D6F∆|u1D6F+|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, introduces the nonlinearity into the

 Remarks: 
The polymer is assumed to have two basic resistance s to deformation: 
1.  An intermolecular barrier to deformation related t o relative movement 
between molecules. 
2.  An evolving anisotropic resistance related to stra ightening of the molecule 
chains. 
 
The model which is implemented and presented in thi s paper is mainly based on the 
framework suggested by Boyce et al.  [2000].  Going  back to the original work by 
Haward and Thackray [1968], they considered the uni axial case only.  The extension to 
a full 3D formulation was proposed by Boyce et al.  [1988].  Moreover, Boyce and co-
workers have during a period of 20 years changed or  further developed the parts of the 
original model.  Haward and Thackray [1968] used an  Eyring model to represent the 
dashpot in Fig. M168-1 , while Boyce et al.  [2000] employed the double-ki nk model of 
Argon [1973] instead.  Part B of the model, describ ing the resistance associated with 
straightening of the molecules, contained originall y a one-dimensional Langevin spring 
[Haward and Thackray, 1968], which was generalized to 3D with the eight-chain model 
by Arruda and Boyce [1993]. 
 
The main structure of the model presented by Boyce et al.  [2000] is kept for this model.

This is Material Type 169. This material model was created for adhesive bonding in 
aluminum structures.  The plasticity model is not v olume-conserving, and hence avoids 
the spuriously high tensile stresses that can devel op if adhesive is modeled using 
traditional elasto-plastic material models.  It is available only  for solid elements of 
formulations 1, 2 and 15. The smallest dimension of  the element is assumed to be the 
through-thickness dimension of the bond, unless THK DIR = 1.

Remarks: 
1.  Through-Thickness Direction and Bond Thickness.   The through-thickness 
direction is identiﬁed from the smallest dimension of each element  by default 
(THKDIR = 0.0). It is expected that this dimension will be smaller than in-plane 
dimensions (typically 1 - 2 mm compared with 5 - 10  mm). If this is not the 
case, one can set the through-thickness direction u sing element numbering 
(THKDIR = 1.0).  Then the thickness direction is ex pected to point from lower 
face (nodes 1-2-3-4) to upper face (nodes 5-6-7-8).   For wedge elements these 
faces are the two triangular faces (nodes 1-2-5) an d (nodes 3-4-6). 
The bond thickness is assumed to be the element siz e in the thickness direction.  
This may be overridden using BTHK. In this case the  behavior becomes inde- 
pendent of the element thickness.  The elastic stiﬀ ness is aﬀected by BTHK, so 
it is necessary to set the characteristic element l ength to a smaller value 
/u1D45∫|u1D4J2Cstnew =/radical.v2BT H K ×/u1D45∫|u1D4J2Cstold   . 
This again aﬀects the critical time step of the ele ment, that is, a small BTHK can 
decrease the element time step signiﬁcantly. *MAT_ARUP_ADHESIVE  *MAT_169  
 2.  Bond Stiffness and Strength.   In-plane stresses are set to zero: it is assumed 
that the stiﬀness and strength of the substrate is large compared with that of 
the adhesive, given the relative thicknesses. 
If the substrate is modeled with shell elements, it  is expected that these will lie 
at the mid-surface of the substrate geometry.  Ther efore, the solid elements 
representing the adhesive will be thicker than the actual bond.  If the elastic 
compliance of the bond is signiﬁcant, this can be c orrected by increasing the 
elastic stiﬀness property |u1D438. 
3.  Stress and Failure.   The yield and failure surfaces are treated as a p ower-law 
combination of direct tension and shear across the bond: 
|parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆
|u1D7≠∆|mCst|aCst|xCst |parenriµhtCvJPWRT 
    + |parenleftCvJ/u1D̅0F
/u1D̅0F|mCst|aCst|xCst − SH T _SL × |u1D7≠∆|parenriµhtCvJPWRS 
    = 1.0 
At yield SHT_SL is the slope of the yield surface a t |u1D7≠∆ = 0 .  See Figure M169-1 . 
The stress-displacement curves for tension and shea r are shown in Figure 
M169-2 . In both cases, GC is the area under the curve.  T he displacement to 
failure in tension is given by 
|u1D4J1ft = 2 |parenleftCvJGCTEN 
TENMAX |parenriµhtCvJ   , 
subject to a lower limit 
|u1D4J1ft, min = |parenleftCvJ2/u1D4:F|zeroCst
|u1D438|minuteCst|parenriµhtCvJ TENMAX  , 
where /u1D4:F|zeroCst is the initial element thickness (or BTHK if used)  and 
|u1D438|minuteCst=|u1D438(1 −/u1D̅08)
(1 − 2/u1D̅08)(1 +/u1D̅08)   . 
If GCTEN is input such that |u1D4J1ft < |u1D4J1ft, min , LS-DYNA will automatically increase 
GCTEN to make |u1D4J1ft = |u1D4J1ft, min .  Therefore, GCTEN has a minimum value of SHT_SL > 0

Similarly, the minimum value for GCSHR is 
GCS H R ≥/u1D4:F|zeroCst
|u1D43A(S H RMAX)|twoCst 
where |u1D43A is the elastic shear modulus. 
Because of the algorithm used, yielding in tension across the bond does not 
require strains in the plane of the bond – unlike t he plasticity models, plastic 
ﬂow is not treated as volume-conserving. 
4.  Output Variables.   The Plastic Strain output variable has a special meaning: 
0 < PS < 1: PS is the maximum value of the yield fu nction experienced 
since time zero 
1 < PS < 2: the element has yielded and the strengt h is reducing towards 
failure – yields at PS = 1, fails at PS = 2. 
The damage cause by cohesive deformation (0 at ﬁrst  yield to 1 at failure) and 
by interfacial deformation are stored in the ﬁrst t wo extra history variables.  
These can be plotted if NEIPH on *DATABASE_EXTENT_B INARY is 2 or 
more.  By this means, the reasons for failure may b e assessed. 
5.  Rate Effects.   When the plastic strain rate rises above EDOT0, r ate eﬀects are 
assumed to scale with the logarithm of the plastic strain rate, as in the example 
shown in Figure M169-3  for cohesive tensile strength with dynamic factor SD-
FAC. The same form of relationship is applied for t he other dynamic factors.  If 
EDOT0 is zero or blank, no rate eﬀects are applied.   Rate eﬀects are applied 
using the viscoplastic method. 
6.  Interfacial Failure.   Interfacial failure is assumed to arise from stre ss 
concentrations at the edges of the bond – typically  the strength of the bond 
becomes almost independent of bond length.  This ty pe of failure is usually 
more brittle than cohesive failure.  To simulate th is, LS-DYNA identiﬁes the StressTENAMX

 free edges of the bond (made up of element faces th at are not shared by other 
elements of material type *MAT_ARUP_ADHESIVE, exclu ding the faces that 
bond to the substrate).  Only these elements can fa il initially.  The neighbors of 
failed elements can then develop free edges and fai l in turn. 
In real adhesive bonds, the stresses at the edges c an be concentrated over very 
small areas; in typical ﬁnite element models the el ements are much too large to 
capture this.  Therefore, the concentration of load s onto the edges of the bond 
is accomplished artiﬁcially, by stiﬀening elements containing free edges (e.g. 
FACET, FACES > 1) and reducing the stiﬀness of inte rior elements (e.g. FAC-
CT, FACCS < 1).  Interior elements are allowed to y ield at reduced loads 
(equivalent to TMAXE × FACET/FACCT  and SMAXE × FACES/FACCS ) to 
prevent excessive stresses developing before the ed ge elements have failed - 
but cannot be damaged until they become edge elemen ts after the failure of 
their neighbors. 
7.  Function Arguments.   Parameters TENMAX, GCTEN, SHRMAX, GCSHR, 
SHRP, SDFAC, and SGFAC can be deﬁned as negative va lues.  In that case, the 
absolute values refer to *DEFINE_FUNCTION IDs.  The  arguments of those 
functions include several properties of both connec tion partners if correspond- 
ing solid elements are in a tied contact with shell  elements. 
These functions depend on:

Since material parameters must be identiﬁed from bo th bond partners during 
initialization, this feature is only available for a subset of material models at the 
moment, namely material models 24, 36, 120, 123, 12 4, 251, and 258. 
8.  Older Versions.  Some corrections were made to this material model t hat can 
cause results to be diﬀerent in R8 and later versio ns compared to R7.1.3 and 
earlier versions.  To avoid recalibration of old ma terial data, it is possible to 
recover previous results with option FBR713 = 1. Th e corrections were related 
to the post-yield stress-strain response not matchi ng the description in the 
manual, with the diﬀerence being most noticeable wh en (a) the elastic stiﬀness 
was low, such that the elastic displacement to yiel d was of the same order as 
the element thickness; or (b) when the power-law te rms PWRS, PWRT were 
not both equal to 2, and strain rate eﬀects were sp eciﬁed (EDOT2, SDFAC). *MAT_RESULTANT_ANISOTROPIC  *MAT_170  
 *MAT_RESULTANT_ANISOTROPIC  
This is  Material Type 170.  This model is available for the  Belytschko-Tsay and the C0 
triangular shell elements.  It is based on a result ant stress formulation.  In-plane 
behavior is treated separately from bending for mod eling perforated materials, such as 
television shadow masks.  The plastic behavior of e ach resultant is speciﬁed with a load 
curve and is completely uncoupled from the other re sultants.  If other shell 
formulations are speciﬁed, the formulation will be automatically switched to 
Belytschko-Tsay.  As implemented, this material mod el cannot be used with user 
deﬁned integration rules. 
NOTE:  This material does not support speciﬁcation of a m a- 
terial angle, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst, for each through-thickness integra- 
tion point of a shell.

Remarks: 
The brace element is intended to represent the buck ling, yielding and cyclic behavior of 
steel elements, such as tubes or I-sections, that c arry only axial loads.  A single beam 
element should be used to represent each structural  element.  Empirical relationships 
are used to determine the buckling and cyclic load- deﬂection behavior.  The cyclic 
behavior is shown in Figure M171-1  (compression shown as negative force and 
displacement).   
 
The initial buckling load (point 2) is: 
|u1D439|u1D44FCst/co⋯⋯a.st initial = FB U CK +FB U CK2 
/u1D4:F|twoCst  , 
where FBUCK and FBUCK2 are input parameters, and /u1D4:F is the length of the beam 
element.  If neither FBUCK nor FBUCK2 are deﬁned, t he default is that the initial 
buckling load is  
SIG Y × A, 
where |u1D434 is the cross sectional area.  The buckling curve ( shown dashed) has the form: 
|u1D439(|u1D4J1) =|u1D439b, initial 
/radical.v1|u1D434|u1D6FF + |u1D43J 
where |u1D6FF is |dividesCv1strain yield strain ⁄ |dividesCv1 , and |u1D434 and |u1D43J are internally calculated functions of 
slenderness ratio ( |u1D7≠6) and loading history. *MAT_171  *MAT_STEEL_CONCENTRIC_BRACE  
  
The member slenderness ratio, |u1D7≠6,  is deﬁned as |u1D4J8Cst|u1D43FCst 
|u1D4JFCst, where /u1D458 depends on end conditions, /u1D4:F 
is the element length, and |u1D4JF is the radius of gyration such that |u1D434|u1D4JF|twoCst=/u1D4:C (and /u1D4:C=
min|parenleftCv2/u1D4:C|u1D466Cst|u1D466Cst ,/u1D4:C|u1D467Cst|u1D467Cst |parenriµhtCv2);  |u1D7≠6 will by default be calculated from the section prop erties and element 
length using /u1D458= 1. Optionally, this may be overridden by input param eter LAMDA to 
allow for diﬀerent end conditions.  
 
Optionally, you may provide a buckling curve BCUR.  The points of the curve give 
compressive displacement ( |u1D46J-axis) as a function of force ( |u1D466-axis); the ﬁrst point should 
have zero displacement and the initial buckling for ce.  Displacement and force should 
both be positive.  The initial buckling force must not be greater than the yield force.  
 
The tensile yield force (point 5 and segment 16-17 in Figure M171-1 ) is deﬁned by 
|u1D439|u1D466Cst= SIG Y × |u1D434, 
where yield stress SIGY is an input parameter and |u1D434 is the cross-sectional area. 
 
Following initial buckling and subsequent yield in tension, the member is assumed to 
be damaged.  The initial buckling curve is then sca led by input parameter CCBRF, 
leading to reduced strength curves such as segments  6-7, 10-14 and 18-19.  This  Figure M171-1.  Cyclic Behavior of a Steel Brace Displacemen tForce

 reduction factor is typically in the range 0.6 to 1 .0 (smaller values for more slender 
members).  By default, CCBRF is calculated using SE AOC 1990: 
CCBRF =1
⎝⎜⎜⎜⎛1 +0.5|u1D7≠6
/u1D̅0B/radical.v5|u1D438
0.5|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst⎠⎟⎟⎟⎞ 
When tensile loading is applied after buckling, the  member must ﬁrst be straightened 
before the full tensile yield force can be develope d.  This is represented by a reduced 
unloading stiﬀness (such as segment 14-15) and the tensile reloading curve (segments 8-
9 and 15-16).  Further details can be found in Brun eau, Uang, and Whittaker [1998] and 
Structural Engineers Association of California [197 4, 1990, 1996]. 
 
 
The response of stocky (low  |u1D7≠6) and slender (high  |u1D7≠6) braces are compared in the graph.  
These diﬀerences are achieved by altering the input  value LAMDA (or the section 
properties of the beam) and FBUCK.

 FEMA thresholds are the total axial strains (deﬁned  by change of length/initial length) 
at which the element is deemed to have passed from one category to the next, such as 
“Elastic”, “Immediate Occupancy”, “Life Safe”, etc.   During the analysis, the maximum 
tensile and compressive strains (“high tide strains ”) are recorded.  These are checked 
against the user-deﬁned limits TS1 to TS4 and CS1 t o CS4.  The output ﬂag is then set to 
0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 according to which limits have bee n passed.  The value in the output ﬁles 
is the highest such ﬂag from tensile or compressive  strains.  To plot this data, select IN-
TEGRATED beam results, Integration point 4, Axial S train. 
 
Maximum plastic strains in tension and compression are also output.  These are deﬁned 
as maximum total strain to date minus the yield or ﬁrst buckling strain for tensile and 
compressive plastic strains, respectively.  To plot  these, select INTEGRATED beam 
results, Integration point 4, “shear stress XY” and  “shear stress XZ” for tensile and 
compressive plastic strains, respectively. *MAT_CONCRETE_EC2  *MAT_172

This is Material Type 172.  This model is available  for shell and Hughes-Liu beam 
elements only.  The material model can represent pl ain concrete only, reinforcing steel 
only, or a smeared combination of concrete and rein forcement.  The model includes 
concrete cracking in tension and crushing in compre ssion as well as reinforcement 
yield, hardening, and failure.  Properties are ther mally sensitive; the material model can 
be used for ﬁre analysis.  Material data and equati ons governing the behavior 
(including thermal properties) are taken from Euroc ode 2 (EC2).  See the remarks below 
for more details on how the standard is applied in the material model.  
 
Although the material model oﬀers many options, a r easonable response may be 
obtained by entering only RO, FC, and FT for plain concrete.  If reinforcement is 
present, YMREINF, SUREINF, FRACRX, FRACRY must be d eﬁned, or for an alternative 
way to model the reinforcement, see *MAT_203/*MAT_H YSTERETIC_REINFORCE-
MENT. Note that, from release R10 onwards, the numb er of possible cracks has been 
increased from 2 (0 and 90 degrees) to 4 (see TYPEC  on Card 1 and Tensile response 
under the Material Behavior of Concrete  section). 
NOTE:  This material does not support speciﬁcation of a m a- 
terial angle, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst, for each through-thickness integra- 
tion point of a shell.

bility calculations (8MPa greater than FC).  For 
ultimate load calculations the user may set FCC 
to a factored characteristic compressive strength.

 Remarks: 
1.  Material Types.   This material model can be used to represent unre inforced 
concrete (FRACR = 0.0 where FRACR = max (FRACX, FRAC Y )), reinforcing 
steel (FRACR = 1.0), or a smeared combination of re inforced concrete with 
evenly distributed reinforcement (0.0 < FRACR < 1.0 ).  Concrete is modelled as 
an initially-isotropic material with a non-rotating  smeared crack approach in 
tension, together with a plasticity model for compr essive loading.  Reinforce- 
ment is treated as separate sets of bars in the loc al material |u1D46J and |u1D466 axes.  The 
reinforcement is assumed not to carry through-thick ness shear or in-plane 
shear.  Therefore, this material model should not b e used to model steel-only 
sections, that is, do not create a section in which  all the integration points are of 
*MAT_172 with both FRACRX and FRACRY set to 1.0.  
2.  Creating Reinforced Concrete Sections.   Reinforced concrete sections for 
shell or beam elements may be created using *PART_C OMPOSITE (for shells) 
or *INTEGRATION_BEAM (for beams) to deﬁne the secti on.  Create one mate- 
rial deﬁnition to represent the concrete using *MAT _CONCRETE_EC2 with 
FRACR = 0.0. Create another material deﬁnition repr esenting the reinforce- 
ment using *MAT_CONCRETE_EC2 with FRACRX and/or FRA CRY = 1.0. 
The material ID of each integration point is then s et to represent either concrete 
or steel.  The position of each integration point w ithin the cross-section and its 
cross-sectional area are chosen to represent the ac tual distribution of rein- 
forcement.  If desired, *MAT_HYSTERETIC_REINFORCEME NT can be used 
for the reinforcement layers instead of *MAT_CONCRE TE_EC2. 
3.  Eurocode 2.   Eurocode 2 (EC2) contains diﬀerent sections appli cable to 
general structural engineering versus ﬁre engineeri ng.  The latter contains 
diﬀerent data for diﬀerent types of concrete and st eel and has been revised 
during its history.  TYPEC and TYPER control the ve rsion and section of the 
EC2 document from which the material data is taken,  and the types of concrete 
and steel being represented.  In the descriptions o f TYPEC and TYPER above, 
“Draft EC2 Annex (ﬁre engineering)” means data take n from the 1995 draft 
Eurocode 2 Part 1-2 (for ﬁre engineering), ENV 1992 -1-2:1995. These are the 
defaults and are suitable for general use where ele vated temperatures are not 
considered. 
EC2 was then issued in 2004 (described above as EC2  1-2:2004 (ﬁre)) with re- 
vised stress-strain data at elevated temperatures ( TYPEC and TYPER = 7 or 8).  
These settings are recommended for analyses with el evated temperatures. 
Meanwhile Eurocode 2 Part 1-1 (for general structur al engineering), EC2 1-
1:2004, contains material data and formulae that di ﬀer from Part 1-2; these are 
obtained by setting TYPEC = 9. This setting is reco mmended where compati- *MAT_CONCRETE_EC2  *MAT_172  
 bility is required with the structural engineering data and assumptions of Part 
1-1 of the Eurocode. 
A further option for modelling concrete, TYPEC = 6,  is provided for applica- 
tions, such as seismic engineering, in which the di ﬀerent stress-strain behaviors 
of conﬁned versus unconﬁned concrete needs to be ca ptured.  This option uses 
equations by Mander et al and does not relate direc tly to Eurocode 2.  
4.  Local Material Axes.   The local material axes deﬁne the directions of t he 
reinforcement bars.  If the reinforcement direction s are not consistent across 
neighbouring elements, the response may be less sti ﬀ than intended – this is 
equivalent to the bars being bent at the element bo undaries.  Local material 
axes default to the same as the element axes, with the local |u1D46J direction pointing 
from Node 1 to Node 2. The local material axes can be controlled using the 
angle BETA on *ELEMENT_SHELL_BETA or using AOPT and  associated in- 
put parameters in the material deﬁnition.  See mate rial type 2 for a description 
of the diﬀerent AOPT settings.  
Only the reinforcement response depends on the loca l material axes, not the 
concrete response.  Therefore, it is not usually ne cessary to set the local materi- 
al axes for material deﬁnitions that do not have re inforcement (i.e., FRA- 
CRX = 0 and FRACRY = 0).  However, when a reinforce d concrete section is 
deﬁned using *PART_COMPOSITE, and either the shear capacity check is in- 
voked (TYPESC > 0, see Remark 5 ) or CMPFLG is set on *DATABASE_EX-
TENT_BINARY, then it is important for all layers in  the *PART_COMPOSITE 
deﬁnition to have identical material axes.  This ca n be achieved either by using 
the BETA angle on *ELEMENT_SHELL_BETA or by inputti ng identical AOPT 
parameters for all the material deﬁnitions referenc ed by the *PART_COMPOS-
ITE card. 
5.  Through-thickness Shear. In this material model, cracks are initiated only b y 
in-plane stresses caused by axial and bending eﬀect s.  Once a crack has formed, 
the through-thickness shear stress is limited by co nsiderations of aggregate 
interlock or friction on the crack surfaces.  If th e in-plane stresses are insuﬃ- 
cient to cause cracks, the through-thickness shear strength is by default unlim- 
ited.  Thus, failures caused primarily by through-t hickness shear will not be 
predicted.  The Shear Capacity Check option (see TY PESC) allows you to ad- 
dress this limitation.  Two classes of behaviour ar e available (described in a 
and b), together with diﬀerent options for the calculati on of shear capacity 
(described in c and d):  
a)  TYPESC < 10 represents the situation where suﬃcien t shear reinforcement 
will be provided to prevent any through-thickness f ailure.  LS-DYNA 
generates extra history variables, so you can compa re the shear demand to 
shear capacity to assess the requirements for shear  reinforcement (see the *MAT_172  *MAT_CONCRETE_EC2  
 list of extra history variables in Remark 8 ). Furthermore, we assume that 
the shear reinforcement will prevent any inelastic through-thickness shear 
deformation.  Thus, through-thickness slipping on c rack planes is auto- 
matically disabled. 
b)  TYPESC > 10 represents the situation where no shea r reinforcement is 
provided.  A brittle failure occurs if the shear ca pacity is exceeded.  Note, 
however, that the shear capacity is calculated from  equations in design 
codes and may be quite conservative. 
c)  If TYPESC = 1 or 11, the shear capacity calculatio n is based on BS 8110-
1:1997. You should supply the percentage reinforcem ent (P_OR_F), eﬀec- 
tive depth of section EFFD (this typically excludes  the cover concrete), and 
load factor GAMSC. These are used in Table 3.8 of B S 8110-1:1997 to de- 
termine the design shear stress.  The “shear capaci ty” is this design shear 
stress times the total section thickness (force per  unit width), modiﬁed ac- 
cording to Equation 6b of BS 8110 to allow for axia l load.  
d)  If TYPESC = 2 or 12, the shear capacity calculatio n is based on ACI 318-
05M. The shear capacity, ∅|u1D449|u1D4JBCst, is calculated assuming ∅= 0.75  and taking 
|u1D449|u1D4JBCst from ACI 318-05M equations 11-4 (for compressive a xial load) or 11-8 
(for tensile axial load).  In these equations, |u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|minuteCst is taken as P_OR_F × FC, the 
term |u1D4J1 is taken as EFFD, and the term |u1D44F|u1D464Cst is taken as 1 to give shear capaci- 
ty as a force per unit width.  Note that in LS-DYNA  versions prior to R13, 
Equation 11-4 was incorrectly implemented, so resul ts from the TYPE-
SC = 2 check prior to R13 should not be used. 
For all of the above options, the “shear demand” (a ctual shear force per unit 
width) is compared to the shear capacity.  This pro cess is performed separately 
for each of the two local directions of the reinfor cement in each element.  When 
deﬁning sections using *PART_COMPOSITE or integrati on rules with multiple 
sets of material properties, it is important that e ach set of material properties 
referenced has the same local material axes (see Remark 4 ). The shear demand 
and axial load (used in calculation of the shear ca pacity) are summed across 
the integration points within the section.  The ext ra history variables for capaci- 
ty, demand, and diﬀerence between capacity and dema nd relate to the whole 
section (not to each integration point separately).   Thus, the same values are 
written to all the integration points within an ele ment. 
6.  Thermal Expansion.   By default, thermal expansion properties from EC2  are 
used.  If no temperatures are deﬁned in the model, properties for 20℃ are 
used.  For TYPEC = 3, 6 or 9, and TYPER = 5, there is no thermal expansion by 
default, and the properties do not vary with temper ature.  The user may over- 
ride the default thermal expansion behaviour by deﬁ ning curves of thermal *MAT_CONCRETE_EC2  *MAT_172  
 expansion coeﬃcient as a function of temperature (L CALPC, LCALPR).  These 
apply no matter what types TYPEC and TYPER have bee n selected. 
7.  Erosion Criteria.   Elements are deleted from the calculation when al l of their 
integration points have reached the erosion criteri a.  Because this material 
model can represent plain concrete without reinforc ement, pure reinforcement 
without any concrete, or a smeared combination, the  criteria depends on the 
type being modeled (see Remark 1 ).  There are three criteria: 
a)  Concrete Tensile Strain Limit .  The concrete tensile (crack-opening) strain 
limit ERODET has been exceeded. 
b)  Concrete Compressive Strain Limit .  The concrete compressive strain limit 
ERODEC + |u1D7≠≠csp  has been exceeded. |u1D7≠≠csp  is the strain at which the stress-
strain relation falls to zero. 
c)  Reinforcement Strain Limit.   The reinforcement strain limit ERODER + |u1D7≠≠rsp  
has been exceeded.  |u1D7≠≠rsp  is the strain at which the stress-strain relation falls 
to zero.  However, if LCRSU > 0, |u1D7≠≠rsp  is assumed to be 2.0. 
The table below indicates which of the criteria app ly to each of the variations of 
material type.  Note that FRACR = max (FRACX, FRAC Y ) as discussed in Re- 
mark 1 .

tively. 
Note that the concrete stress history variables are  stored in element local axes 
irrespective of AOPT, that is, local |u1D46J is always the direction from node 1 to 
node 2. The reinforcement stresses are in the reinf orcement directions; these do 
take account of AOPT. 
Material Behavior of Concrete: 
Thermal sensitivity 
 
For TYPEC = 1,2,4,5,7,8, the material properties ar e thermally-sensitive.  If no 
temperatures are deﬁned in the model, it behaves as  if at 20℃. Pre-programmed 
relationships between temperature and concrete prop erties are taken from the EC2 
document.  The thermal expansion coeﬃcient is as de ﬁned in EC2, is non-zero by 
default, and is a function of temperature.  This co eﬃcient may be overridden by 
inputting the curve LCALPC. TYPEC = 3, 6 and 9 are not thermally sensitive and have 
no thermal expansion coeﬃcient by default. 
 *MAT_CONCRETE_EC2  *MAT_172  
 Tensile response 
 
The concrete is assumed to crack in tension when th e maximum in-plane principal 
stress reaches FT. A non-rotating smeared crack app roach is used.  Cracks can open and 
close repeatedly under hysteretic loading.  When a crack is closed, it can carry 
compression according to the normal compressive str ess-strain relationships.  The 
direction of the crack relative to the element coor dinate system is stored when the crack 
ﬁrst forms.  The material can carry compression par allel to the crack even when the 
crack is open.  Further cracks may then form at pre -determined angles to the ﬁrst crack, 
if the tensile stress in that direction reaches FT.  In versions up to R9, the number of 
further cracks is limited to one, at 90 degrees to the ﬁrst crack.  In versions starting from 
R10, up to three further cracks can form, at 45, 90  and 135 degrees to the ﬁrst crack.  The 
tensile stress is limited to FT only in the availab le crack directions.  The tensile stress in 
other directions is unlimited and could exceed FT. This is a limitation of the non-
rotating crack approach and may lead to models bein g non-conservative, that is, the 
response is stronger than implied by the input.  Th e increase of the possible number of 
cracks from two to four signiﬁcantly reduces this e rror and may therefore cause models 
to seem “weaker” in R10 than in R9 under some loadi ng conditions.  An option to revert 
to the previous 2-crack behavior is available in R1 0 – add 100 to TYPEC. 
 
After initial cracking, the tensile stress reduces with increasing tensile strain.  A ﬁnite 
amount of energy must be absorbed to create a fully  open crack.  In practice the 
reinforcement holds the concrete together, allowing  it to continue to take some tension 
(this eﬀect is known as tension-stiﬀening).  The op tions available for the stress-strain 
curve are shown below.  The piecewise curve is used  by default.  The simple linear 
curve applies only if ESOFT > 0.0 and ECUTEN = 0.0.

 LCHAR can optionally be used to maintain constant e nergy per unit area of crack 
irrespective of mesh size, that is, the crack openi ng displacement is ﬁxed rather than the 
crack opening strain.  LCHAR × ECUTEN is then the displacement to fully open a 
crack.  For the actual elements, crack opening disp lacement is estimated by strain ×
/radical.v1area .  Note that if LCHAR is deﬁned, it is also used as  the crack spacing in the NS 3473 
aggregate interlock calculation. 
 
For the thermally-sensitive values of TYPEC, the re lationship of FT with temperature is 
taken from EC2 – there is no input option to change  this.  FT is assumed to remain at its 
input value at temperatures up to 100°C, then to re duce linearly with temperature to 
zero at 600°C. Up to 500°C, the crack opening strai n ECUTEN increases with 
temperature such that the fracture energy to open t he crack remains constant.  Above 
500℃ the crack opening strain does not increase fur ther. 
 
In some concrete design codes and standards, it is stipulated that the tensile strength of 
concrete should be assumed to be zero.  However, fo r MAT_CONCRETE_EC2 it is not 
recommended to set FT to zero, because: 
• Cracks will form at random orientations caused by  small dynamic tensile 
stresses, leading to unexpected behavior when the l oading increases because the 
crack orientations are ﬁxed when the cracks ﬁrst fo rm;  
• The shear strength of cracked concrete may then a lso become zero in the analysis 
(according to the aggregate interlock formula, the post-crack shear strength is 
assumed proportional to FT). 
These problems may be tackled by using the inputs o n Card 9. Firstly, separate tensile 
strengths may be input for the tensile response and  for calculating the shear strength of 
cracked concrete.  Secondly, by using the load curv e LCFTT, the tensile strength may be 
ramped gradually down to zero after the static load s have been applied, ensuring that 
the cracks will form in the correct orientation. 
 
Compressive response for TYPEC = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and  8 
 
For TYPEC = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, the compressive b ehavior of the concrete initially 
follows a stress-strain curve deﬁned in EC2 as: 
Stress = FC max ×
⎣⎢⎡|parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠
|u1D7≠≠c1 |parenriµhtCvJ ×3
2 + |parenleftCv4|u1D7≠≠
|u1D7≠≠c1 |parenriµhtCv4|threeCst
⎦⎥⎤  , 
where |u1D7≠≠c1  is the strain at which the ultimate compressive st rength, FC max , is reached, 
and |u1D7≠≠ is the current equivalent uniaxial compressive str ain. 
 
The initial elastic modulus is given by |u1D438 = 3 × FC max /2|u1D7≠≠c1 . Upon reaching FC max , the 
stress decreases linearly with increasing strain, r eaching zero at a strain |u1D7≠≠cu . Strains |u1D7≠≠c1  
and |u1D7≠≠cu  are by default taken from EC2 and are functions of  temperature.  At 20 oC they *MAT_CONCRETE_EC2  *MAT_172  
 take values 0.0025 and 0.02 respectively. FC max  is also a function of temperature, given 
by the input parameter FC (which applies at 20 oC) times a temperature-dependent 
softening factor taken from EC2.  The diﬀerences am ong TYPEC = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are 
limited to (a) diﬀerent reductions of FC at elevate d temperatures and (b) diﬀerent 
values of |u1D7≠≠c1  at elevated temperatures. 
 
Compressive response for TYPEC = 3 
 
For TYPEC = 3, the stress-strain behaviour follows the same form as described above.  
To over-ride the default values of the Young’s modu lus and |u1D7≠≠cu , set ET36 and ECUT36, 
respectively.  In this case, the strain |u1D7≠≠c1  is calculated from the elastic stiﬀness, and there  
is no thermal sensitivity.  
 
Compressive response for TYPEC = 6 
 
For TYPEC = 6, the above compressive crushing behav iour is replaced with the 
equations proposed by Mander.  This algorithm can m odel unconﬁned or conﬁned 
concrete; for unconﬁned, leave FCC blank.  For conﬁ ned concrete, input the conﬁned 
compressive strength as FCC.   
 
As indicated in Figure M172-3 , |u1D7≠≠c1  is the strain at maximum compressive stress, |u1D7≠≠cu  is 
the ultimate compressive strain, and |u1D7≠≠csp  is the spalling strain.  Default values for these 
quantities for both conﬁned and unconﬁned concrete are calculated as follows: 
|u1D7≠≠c1 = 0.002 × |<racketleftCvJ1 + 5 |parenleftCvJFCC 
FC − 1|parenriµhtCvJ |<racketriµhtCvJ

Note that for unconﬁned concrete, FCC = FC causing |u1D7≠≠c1  to default to 0.002.  To over-
ride the default values |u1D7≠≠c1 , |u1D7≠≠cu , and |u1D7≠≠csp , set EC1_6, ECUT36, and ECSP69, respectively.  
 
Compressive response: TYPEC = 9 
 
For TYPEC = 9, the input parameter FC is the charac teristic cylinder strength in the 
stress units of the model.  FC × UNITC is assumed t o be f ck , the strength class in MPa 
units.  The mean tensile strength f ctm , mean Young’s modulus E cm , and the strains used 
to construct the stress-strain curve such as |u1D7≠≠c1  are by default evaluated automatically 
from tabulated functions of f ck  given in Table 3.1 of EC2. The compressive strengt h of 
the material is given by the input parameter FCC, w hich defaults to the mean 
compressive strength f cm  deﬁned in EC2 as f ck  + 8MPa.  The user may override the 
default compressive strength by inputting FCC expli citly.  The stress-strain curve 
follows this form: 
Stress 
FCC =  /u1D458|u1D7≠2 − |u1D7≠2|twoCst
1 + (/u1D458− 2)|u1D7≠2  , 
where FCC is the input parameter FCC (default: = (f ck  + 8MPa)/UNITC), |u1D7≠2 = strain/|u1D7≠≠c1, 
/u1D458= 1.05|u1D438 × |u1D7≠≠c1 FCC ⁄ , and |u1D438 is the Young’s modulus.

 The default parameters are intended to be appropria te for a serviceability analysis 
(mean properties), so default FT = f ctm  and default |u1D438 = E cm . For an ultimate load analysis, 
FCC should be the “design compressive strength” (no rmally the factored characteristic 
strength, including any appropriate material factor s); FT should be input as the factored 
characteristic tensile strength; GAMCE9 may be inpu t (a material factor that divides the 
Young’s Modulus so |u1D438 = |u1D438cm GAMCE 9 ⁄ ); and a creep factor PHIEF9 may be input that 
scales |u1D7≠≠c1 by (1 + PHIEF9).  
Unload/Reload Stiffness (All Concrete Types): 
During compressive loading, the elastic modulus wil l be reduced according to the 
parameter UNLFAC (default = 0.5).  See Figure M172-4 .  UNLFAC = 0.0 means no 
reduction, that is, the initial elastic modulus wil l apply during unloading and reloading.  
UNLFAC =1.0 means that unloading results in no perm anent strain.  Intermediate 
values imply a permanent strain linearly interpolat ed between these extremes.  Tensile 
strength is reduced by the same factor as the elast ic modulus. 
Optional Compressive Strength Degradation due to Cr acking: 
By default, the compressive strength of cracked and  uncracked elements is the same.  If 
DEGRAD is non-zero, the formula from BS8110 is used  to reduce compressive strength 
during or after crack opening has occurred:  Figure M172-4.   Concrete unloading behavior A

where |u1D7≠≠tmax  is the maximum (tensile) crack-opening strain that  has occurred up to the 
current time. 
Shear Strength on Cracking Planes: 
Before cracking, the through-thickness shear stress  in the concrete is unlimited., unless 
TYPESC > 10 (see Remark 5 ) For cracked elements, shear stress on the crack p lane 
(magnitude of shear stress including element-plane and through-thickness terms) is 
treated in one of two ways: 
1.  If AGGSZ > 0.0, the relationship from Norwegian st andard NS3473 is used to 
model the aggregate-interlock that allows cracked c oncrete to carry shear load- 
ing.  The maximum shear stress that can be carried on the crack plane, /u1D̅0F|u1D4JACst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D46JCst , 
depends on compressive stress on the crack |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst(if the crack is closed) or on 
crack opening width |u1D464 (if the crack is open):  
/u1D̅0Fmax = 0.1 8/u1D̅0Frm + 1.64|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst− 0.82 |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J≠Cst|twoCst
/u1D̅0Frm  
/u1D̅0Frm =  2FTS H R 
0.31 + 24|u1D464
(D|zeroCst+ 16) 
FTSHR is deﬁned on Card 9 and defaults to FT on Car d 1.  
UNITL is compulsory when AGGSZ is non-zero. This is  the factor that con- 
verts model length units to millimeters, that is, t he aggregate size in millime- 
tres D|zeroCst= AGGS Z  ×U NITL .  
The crack width is estimated from |u1D464 =U NITL × |u1D7≠≠cro ×/u1D4:F|u1D4J2Cst, where |u1D7≠≠cro  is the 
crack opening strain and /u1D4:F|u1D4J2Cst is the crack spacing.  /u1D4:F|u1D4J2Cst is taken as LCHAR if non-
zero or is equal to element size if LCHAR is zero.  
Optionally, TAUMXC may be used to set the maximum s hear stress when the 
crack is closed and the normal stress is zero – by default this works out as 
1.161 × FT from the above equations.  If TAUMXC is deﬁned, the shear stress 
from the NS3473 formula, /u1D̅0Fmax , is scaled by TAUMXC / 1.161 × FT. 
2.  If AGGSZ = 0.0, the aggregate interlock is modeled  by this formula: 
/u1D̅0Fmax =TA U MXC 
1.0 +|u1D7≠≠cro 
ECRAGG + min|parenleftCv2M U × |u1D7≠∆comp ,TA U MXF|parenriµhtCv2  , 
where /u1D̅0Fmax  is the maximum shear stress carried across a crack ; |u1D7≠∆comp is the 
compressive stress across the crack (this is zero i f the crack is open); and EC- *MAT_CONCRETE_EC2  *MAT_172  
 RAGG is the crack opening strain at which the input  shear strength TAUMXC 
is halved.  Again, TAUMXC defaults to 1.161 × FT. 
 
Note that if a shear capacity check is speciﬁed, th e above applies only to in-plane shear, 
while the through-thickness shear is unlimited. 
Reinforcement: 
The reinforcement is treated as separate bars provi ding resistance only in the local |u1D46J 
and |u1D466 directions – it does not carry shear in-plane or o ut of plane.  
 
For TYPER = 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8, the behaviour is thermally sensitive and follows stress-
strain relationships of a form deﬁned in EC2. At 20oC (or if no thermal input is deﬁned) 
the behaviour is elastic-perfectly-plastic with You ng’s Modulus EREINF and ultimate 
stress SUREINF, up to the onset of failure, after w hich the stress reduces linearly with 
increasing strain until ﬁnal failure.  At elevated temperatures there is a nonlinear 
transition between the elastic phase and the perfec tly plastic phase, and EREINF and 
SUREINF are scaled down by temperature-dependent fa ctors deﬁned in EC2. The strain 
at which failure occurs depends on the reinforcemen t type (TYPER) and the 
temperature.  For example, for hot-rolled reinforci ng steel at 20 oC failure begins at 15% 
strain and is complete at 20% strain. The thermal e xpansion coeﬃcient is as deﬁned in 
EC2 and is a function of temperature.  This may be overridden by inputting the curve 
LCAPLS.  The diﬀerences between TYPER = 1, 2, 4, 7,  8 are limited to (a) diﬀerent 
reductions of EREINF and SUREINF at elevated temper atures, (b) diﬀerent nonlinear 
transitions between elastic and plastic phases and (c) the strains at which softening 
begins and is complete. 
 
The default stress-strain curve for reinforcement m ay be overridden using TYPER = 5 
and LCRSU. In this case, the reinforcement properti es are not temperature-sensitive and 
the yield stress is given by S U REINF × |u1D4J3 (|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst), where |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 is the load curve value at the 
current plastic strain.  To include failure of the reinforcement, the curve should reduce 
to zero at the desired failure strain and remain ze ro for higher strains.  Note that by 
default LS-DYNA re-interpolates the input curve to have 100 equally-spaced points; if 
the last point on the curve is at very high strain,  then the initial part of the curve may 
become poorly deﬁned. *MAT_173  *MAT_MOHR_COULOMB

Remarks: 
1.  Mohr Coulomb Yield Surface.   This material has a Mohr Coulomb yield 
surface, given by  
/u1D̅0Fmax = |u1D436 + |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCsttan (P H I)  , 
where /u1D̅0Fmax  is the maximum shear stress on any plane, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst is the normal stress 
on that plane (positive in compression), |u1D436 is the cohesion, and PHI is the fric- 
tion angle.  The plastic potential function is of t he form  
|u1D6FD|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J8Cst− |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst+ constant, 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J8Cst is the maximum principal stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst is   the minimum principal stress, 
and 
|u1D6FD =1 + sin(PSI)
1 − sin(PSI)  . 
2.  Depth-Dependent Properties.   If depth-dependent properties are used (see 
GMODDP, GMODGR, CVALGR), the model must be oriented  with the /u1D46̅-axis 
in the upward direction. 
3.  Plastic Strain.   Plastic strain is deﬁned as 
/radical.v52
3|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst   , 
that is, the same way as for other elasto-plastic m aterial models. 
4.  Plastic Strain Adjustments.  Friction and dilation angles PHI and PSI may 
vary with plastic strain.  To model heavily consoli dated materials under large 
shear strains, as the strain increases, the dilatio n angle typically reduces to zero 
and the friction angle reduces to a lower, pre-cons olidation value. *MAT_MOHR_COULOMB  *MAT_173  
 For similar reasons, the shear modulus may reduce w ith plastic strain, but this 
option may sometimes give unstable results. 
5.  Additional Cohesion.   The load curves, LCCPDR, LCCPT, LCCJDR, and LC-
CJT, allow extra cohesion to be speciﬁed as a funct ion of time.  The cohesion is 
additional to that speciﬁed in the material paramet ers.  This is intended for use 
during the initial stages of an analysis to allow a pplication of gravity or other 
loads without cracking or yielding, and for the cra cking or yielding then to be 
introduced in a controlled manner.  This is done by  specifying extra cohesion 
that exceeds the expected stresses initially, then declining to zero.  If no curves 
are speciﬁed, no extra cohesion is applied. 
6.  Time-Dependent Properties.   LCSFAC, the load curve for factor on strength, 
applies simultaneously to the cohesion and tan (P H I)  of the parent material 
and all joints.  This feature is intended for reduc ing the strength of the material 
gradually to explore factors of safety.  If no curv e is present, a constant factor 
of 1 is assumed.  Values much greater than 1.0 may cause problems with stabil- 
ity.  Alternatively, separate functions of time may  be deﬁned for each of the 
properties GMOD, CVAL and PHI using load curves LCG MT, LCCVT and 
LCPHT, respectively.  
7.  ANISO.   The anisotropic factor, ANISO, applies the elasti c shear stiﬀness in the 
global /u1D44B |u1D44D  and /u1D44C |u1D44D  planes.  It can be used only in a pure Mohr-Coulom b mode 
(NPLANES = 0). 
8.  Tensile Pressure Limit.   For a friction angle greater than zero, the Mohr 
Coulomb yield surface implies a tensile pressure li mit equal to 
C V AL tan(P H I) ⁄. By default, voids develop in the material when th is pressure 
limit is reached, and the pressure will never becom e more tensile than the ten- 
sile pressure limit.  The volumetric void strain is  tracked and is reversible if the 
strain is reversed. 
9.  NOVOID.   If NOVOID = 1, then the tensile pressure limit is  not applied and 
stress states in which the pressure is more tensile  than C V AL tan(P H I) ⁄ are 
permitted but will be purely hydrostatic with no sh ear stress.  NOVOID is 
recommended in Multi-Material ALE simulations in wh ich the development of 
voids or air space is already accounted for by the Multi-Material ALE. 
10.  Soil or Rock.   To model soil, set NJOINT = 0. The joints allow m odeling of 
rock and are treated identically to those of *MAT_J OINTED_ROCK. 
11.  Joint Plane Orientations.   The joint plane orientations are deﬁned by the 
angle of a “downhill vector” drawn on the plane, me aning the vector is orient- 
ed within the plane to obtain the maximum possible downhill angle.  DIP is the 
angle of this line below the horizontal.  DIPANG is  the plan-view angle of the *MAT_173  *MAT_MOHR_COULOMB  
 line (pointing downhill) measured clockwise from th e global /u1D44C-axis about the 
global |u1D44D-axis. 
12.  Masonry and Joint Planes.   Joint planes would generally be deﬁned in the 
global axis system if they are taken from survey da ta and the material repre- 
sents rock.  However, the material model can also b e used to represent mason- 
ry, in which case the weak planes represent the mor tar joints; if these joints lie 
parallel to the local element axes, set LOCAL = 1. 
13.  Rigid Body Motion.   The joint planes rotate with the rigid body motio n of the 
elements, irrespective of whether their initial deﬁ nitions are in the global or 
local axis system. 
14.  Extra History Variables.   Extra history variables may be requested (see

 Creating sections for reinforced concrete beams: 
This material model can be used to represent unrein forced concrete (FRACR = 0), steel 
(FRACR = 1), or reinforced concrete with evenly dis tributed reinforcement 
(0 < FRACR < 1). 
Alternatively, use *INTEGRATION_BEAM to deﬁne the s ection, with the PID ﬁeld for 
each integration point being used to identify the M aterial to be used at that integration 
point.  Create one Part for concrete, and another f or steel.  These Parts should reference 
Materials, both of type *MAT_RC_BEAM, one with FRAC R = 0, the other with 
FRACR = 1. Then, by assigning one or other of these  Part IDs to each integration point 
the reinforcement can be applied to the correct loc ations within the section of the beam. 
Concrete: 
In monotonic compression, the approach of Park and Kent, as described in Park & 
Paulay [1975] is used.  The material follows a para bolic stress-strain curve up to a 
maximum stress equal to the cylinder strength FC; t herafter the strength decays linearly 
with strain until the residual strength is reached.   Default values for some material 
parameters will be calculated automatically as foll ows: 
EC50 =(3 + 0.2 9|u1D439|u1D436)
145|u1D439|u1D436 − 1000  
where FC is in MPa as per Park and Kent test data. 
E U NL =  initial tangent slope =2FC 
EC1  
User-deﬁned values for EUNL lower than this are not  permitted, but higher values may 
be deﬁned  if desired. 
FT = 1.4 |parenleftCvJFC 
10 |parenriµhtCvJ|twoCst
|threeCst 
where FC is in MPa as per Park and Kent test data. 
ESOFT = E U NL 
User-deﬁned values higher than EUNL are not permitt ed. 
 
UNITC is used only to calculate default values for the above parameters from FC. 
 
Strain-softening behavior tends to lead to deformat ions being concentrated in one 
element, and hence the overall force-deﬂection beha vior of the structure can be mesh-
size-dependent if the softening is characterized by  strain.  To avoid this, a characteristic 
length (LCHAR) may be deﬁned.  This is the length o f specimen (or element) that 
would exhibit the deﬁned monotonic stress-strain re lationship.  LS-DYNA adjusts the 
stress-strain relationship after ultimate load for each element, such that all elements 
irrespective of their length will show the same deﬂ ection during strain softening (i.e. *MAT_174  *MAT_RC_BEAM  
 between ultimate load and residual load).  Therefor e, although deformation will still be 
concentrated in one element, the load-deﬂection beh avior should be the same 
irrespective of element size.  For tensile behavior , ESOFT is similarly scaled. 
 
 
 
Cyclic behavior is broadly suggested by Blakeley an d Park [1973] as described in Park & 
Paulay [1975]; the stress-strain response lies with in the Park-Kent envelope, and is 
characterized by stiﬀ initial unloading response at  slope EUNL followed by a less stiﬀ 
response if it unloads to less than half the curren t strength.  Reloading stiﬀness 
degrades with increasing strain. 
 
In tension, the stress rises linearly with strain u ntil a tensile limit FT is reached.  
Thereafter the stiﬀness and strength decays with in creasing strain at a rate ESOFT. The 
stiﬀness also decays such that unloading always ret urns to strain at which the stress 
most recently changed to tensile.

 where |u1D7≠≠ and |u1D7≠∆ are strain and stress, |u1D7≠≠|u1D46≠Cst is the strain at zero stress, E is Young’s Modulus, 
and r and |u1D7≠∆/u1D4:6.st |u1D43BCst  are as deﬁned below  
 
Two options are given for calculation r and |u1D7≠∆/u1D4:6.st |u1D43BCst , which is performed at each stress 
reversal: 
1.  If RREINF is input as -1, r and σCH  are calculated internally from formulae 
given in Kent and Park.  Parameter r depends on the  number of stress rever- 
sals.  Parameter |u1D7≠∆/u1D4:6.st |u1D43BCst  depends on the plastic strain that occurred betwee n the 
previous two stress reversals.  The formulae were s tatistically derived from 
experiments, but may not ﬁt all circumstances.  In particular, large diﬀerences 
in behavior may be caused by the presence or absenc e of small stress reversals 
such as could be caused by high frequency oscillati ons.  Therefore, results 
might sometimes be unduly sensitive to small change s in the input data. 
2.  If RREINF is entered by the user or left blank, r is held constant while |u1D7≠∆/u1D4:6.st |u1D43BCst  is 
calculated on each reversal such that the Ramberg-O sgood curve meets the 
monotonic stress-strain curve at the point from whi ch it last unloaded, e.g. 
points 6 and 8 are coincident in the graph below.  The default setting RRE-
INF = 4.0 gives similar hysteresis behavior to that  described by Kent & Park 
but is unlikely to be so sensitive to small changes  of input data. 
Output: 
It is recommended to use BEAMIP on *DATABASE_EXTENT _BINARY to request stress 
and strain output at the individual integration poi nts.  If this is done, for MAT_RC_-
BEAM only, element curvature is written to the outp ut ﬁles in place of plastic strain.  In 
the post-processor, select “plastic strain” to disp lay curvature (whichever of the 
curvatures about local y and z axes has greatest ab solute value will be plotted).  
Alternatively, select “axial strain” to display the  total axial strain (elastic + plastic) at 
that integration point; this can be combined with a xial stress to create hysteresis plots 
such as those shown above. *MAT_VISCOELASTIC_THERMAL  *MAT_175

Remarks: 
Rate eﬀects are taken into accounted through linear  viscoelasticity by a convolution

where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst(|u1D461Cst−/u1D̅0F.st) is the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent stres s measures.  This stress is 
added to the stress tensor determined from the stra in energy functional.  
 
If we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, the relaxation function is represented by 
six terms from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst  . 
We characterize this in the input by shear moduli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and decay constants, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.  An 
arbitrary number of terms, up to 6, may be used whe n applying the viscoelastic model. 
 
For volumetric relaxation, the relaxation function is also represented by the Prony series 
in terms of bulk moduli: *MAT_VISCOELASTIC_THERMAL  *MAT_175  
 /u1D458(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43∆|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J8Csts/u1D45A.sts|u1D461Cst|u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
The Arrhenius and Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) shift  functions account for the eﬀects 
of the temperature on the stress relaxation.  A sca led time, |u1D461|minuteCst, 
|u1D461|minuteCst=/integral.v:Φ(|u1D447)|u1D4J1|u1D461 |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst , 
is used in the relaxation function instead of the p hysical time.  The Arrhenius shift 
function is 
Φ(|u1D447) = exp |<racketleftCvJ−|u1D434 |parenleftCvJ1
|u1D447−1
|u1D447REF |parenriµhtCvJ|<racketriµhtCvJ  , 
and the Williams-Landel-Ferry shift function is 
Φ(|u1D447) = exp |parenleftCvJ−|u1D434|u1D447 − |u1D447REF 
|u1D43J + |u1D447 − |u1D447REF |parenriµhtCvJ . 
If all three values (TREF, A, and B) are not zero, the WLF function is used; the 
Arrhenius function is used if B is zero; and no sca ling is applied if all three values are 
zero. *MAT_176  *MAT_QUASILINEAR_VISCOELASTIC

This is Material Type 176. This is a quasi-linear, isotropic, viscoelastic material based on 
a one-dimensional model by Fung [1993], which repre sents biological soft tissues, such 
as the brain.  It is implemented for solid and shel l elements.  As of LS-DYNA version 
971, a second formulation has been implemented that  allows for larger strains, but in 
general, will not give the same results as the prev ious (default) implementation.

where |u1D436|u1D4J7Cst, |u1D44F|u1D4J7Cst, and |u1D4JB are material constants and /u1D4:D= |u1D7≠6|oneCst|u1D7≠6|twoCst|u1D7≠6|threeCst represents the ratio of the 
deformed to the undeformed state.  The principal Ca uchy stresses are

and the bulk modulus is: 
|u1D43∆ = 2|u1D7≠7 |parenleftCvJ|u1D4JB +1
3|parenriµhtCvJ 
The value for |u1D43∆ deﬁned in the input is used in the calculation of contact forces and for 
the material time step.  Generally, this value shou ld be equal to or greater than the |u1D43∆ 
given in the above equation.

measures.  This stress is added to the stress tenso r determined from the strain energy 
functional. 
 
If we wish to include only simple rate eﬀects, the relaxation function is represented by 
six terms from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|u1D441Cst

|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a dampers and springs in 
series.  We characterize this in the input by shear  moduli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst, and decay constants, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst.

This is Material Type 179 (and 180 if the ORTHO opt ion below is active) for modeling 
rate independent low density foams, which have the property that the hysteresis in the 
loading-unloading curve is considerably reduced aft er the ﬁrst loading cycle.  For this 
material we assume that the loading-unloading curve  is identical after the ﬁrst cycle of 
loading is completed and that the damage is isotrop ic, that is, the behavior after the ﬁrst 
cycle of loading in the orthogonal directions also follows the second curve.  The main 
application at this time is to model the observed b ehavior in the compressible synthetic 
foams that are used in some bumper designs.  Tables  may be used in place of load 
curves to account for strain rate eﬀects.

If the foam develops orthotropic behavior, that is,  after the ﬁrst loading and unloading 
cycle the material in the orthogonal directions are  unaﬀected, then the ORTHO option 
should be used.  If the ORTHO option is active the directionality of the loading is 
stored.  This option requires additional storage fo r history variables related to the 
orthogonality and is slightly more expensive.

 Remarks: 
1.  Uniaxial Response.   This model is based on *MAT_LOW_DENSITY_FOAM.  
The uniaxial response is shown in Figure M179-1  with a large shape factor and 
small hysteretic factor.  If the shape factor is no t used, the unloading will occur 
on the loading curve for the second and subsequent cycles. 
2.  Damage and Hysteresis.   The damage is deﬁned as the ratio of the current 
volume strain to the maximum volume strain, and it is used to interpolate be- 
tween the responses deﬁned by LCID1 and LCID2.  
HU deﬁnes a hysteretic scale factor that is applied  to the stress interpolated 
from LCID1 and LCID2,  
|u1D7≠∆ = |<racketleftCvJHU + (1 −HU ) × min |parenleftCvJ1,|u1D4J2|iCst|nCst|tCst

|<racketriµhtCvJ|u1D7≠∆(LCID1,LCID2) 
where |u1D4J2int  is the internal energy and |u1D446 is the shape factor.  Setting HU to 1 re- 
sults in a scale factor of 1. Setting HU close to z ero scales the stress by the ratio 
of the internal energy to the maximum internal ener gy raised to the power S, 
resulting in the stress being reduced when the stra in is low. *MAT_SIMPLIFIED_RUBBER/FOAM  *MAT_181

actual length during unloading.  The unload curve s hould cover 
exactly the same range as LC or the load curves of TBID and its

Remarks:

The general failure criterion for polymers is propo sed by Feng and Hallquist as  
|u1D4J3 (/u1D4:C|oneCst,/u1D4:C|twoCst,/u1D4:C|threeCst) = (/u1D4:C|oneCst− 3) + Γ|oneCst(/u1D4:C|oneCst− 3)|twoCst+ Γ|twoCst(/u1D4:C|twoCst− 3) = |u1D43∆ 
where |u1D43∆ is a material parameter which controls the size en closed by the failure surface, 
and /u1D4:C|oneCst, /u1D4:C|twoCst and /u1D4:C|threeCst are the three invariants of right Cauchy-Green def ormation tensor ( /u1D402)

To avoid sudden failure and numerical diﬃculty, mat erial failure, which is usually a 
time point, is modeled as a process of damage growt h.  In this case, the two threshold 
values are chosen as (1 - h)K and  K, where h (also called EH) is a small number chosen 
based on experimental results reﬂecting the range b etween damage initiation and 
material failure. 
 
The damage is deﬁned as function of |u1D4J3: 
|u1D437 =
⎩|<raceleftCex|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex|<raceleftCex⎧
  0     if    |u1D4J3 ≤ (1 − ℎ)|u1D43∆

1     if    |u1D4J3 ≥ |u1D43∆ 
This deﬁnition indicates that damage is ﬁrst-order continuous.  Under this deﬁnition, 
the tangent stiﬀness matrix will be continuous.  Th e reduced stress considering damage 
eﬀect is 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = (1 − |u1D437)|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D45C.st 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst /u1D45C.st is the undamaged stress.  It is assumed that prior  to ﬁnal failure, material 
damage is recoverable.  Once material failure occur s, damage will become permanent. 
 
The LOG_LOG_INTERPOLATION option interpolates the s train rate eﬀect in the table 
TBID using log-log interpolation. 
 
Bad choices of curves for the stress-strain respons e may lead to an unstable model, and 
there is an option to check this to a certain toler ance level, see dimensionless parameter 
STOL. The check is done by examining the eigenvalue s of the tangent modulus at 
selected stretch points and a warning message is is sued if an eigenvalue is less than –
STOL × BULK, where BULK indicates the bulk modulus of the  material.  For STOL < 0 
the check is disabled, otherwise it should be chose n with care, a too small value may 
detect instabilities that are insigniﬁcant in pract ice.  To avoid signiﬁcant instabilities it is 
recommended to use smooth curves, at best the curve s should be continuously 
diﬀerentiable, in fact for the incompressible case,  a suﬃcient condition for stability is 
that the stress-stretch curve |u1D446(|u1D7≠6)  can be written as 
|u1D446(|u1D7≠6) =/u1D4:B(|u1D7≠6) −/u1D4:B
⎝⎜⎛1
/radical.v1|u1D7≠6⎠⎟⎞
|u1D7≠6/radical.v1|u1D7≠6 
where /u1D4:B(|u1D7≠6) is a function with /u1D4:B(1) = 0  and /u1D4:B′(|u1D7≠6) > 0 . 
 *MAT_181  *MAT_SIMPLIFIED_RUBBER/FOAM  
 For solid elements, rate eﬀects may also be taken i nto account through linear 
viscoelasticity by setting VISCO = 1.0.   For VFLAG  = 0, this is done through a 
convolution integral of the form: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D461Cst
|zeroCst∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst 
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F  
or in terms of the second Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress, {|u1D446|zeroCst }, and Green's strain tensor, {|u1D446RT }, 
|u1D446|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D438|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst 
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst 
where |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) and |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) are the relaxation functions for the diﬀerent stre ss 
measures.  This stress is added to the stress tenso r determined from the strain energy 
functional. 
 
The relaxation function is represented by six terms  from the Prony series: 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |u1D6F+|zeroCst+ |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st |u1D461Cst |u1D441Cst
|u1D4JACst=|oneCst 
given by, 
|u1D4J4(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts|u1D461Cst|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst 
This model is eﬀectively a Maxwell ﬂuid which consi sts of a dampers and springs in 
series.  We characterize this in the input by shear  moduli, |u1D43A|u1D4J6, and decay constants, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6  
An arbitrary number of terms may be used. 
 
For VFLAG = 1, the viscoelastic term is 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D461Cst
|zeroCst∂|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst |u1D438Cst
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F  
where |u1D7≠∆/u1D458/u1D45∫|u1D438 is the instantaneous stress evaluated from the int ernal energy functional.  The 
coeﬃcients in the Prony series therefore correspond  to normalized relaxation moduli 
instead of elastic moduli. 
 
The Mooney-Rivlin rubber model (model 27) is obtain ed by specifying n = 1.  In spite of 
the diﬀerences in formulations with model 27, we ﬁn d that the results obtained with 
this model are nearly identical with those of mater ial 27 as long as large values of 
Poisson’s ratio are used. *MAT_SIMPLIFIED_RUBBER_WITH_DAMAGE  *MAT_183

This is Material Type 183. This material model prov ides an incompressible rubber 
model deﬁned by a single uniaxial load curve for lo ading (or a table if rate eﬀects are 
considered) and a single uniaxial load curve for un loading.  This model is similar to 
*MAT_181/*MAT_SIMPLIFIED_RUBBER/FOAM.  This materia l may be used with 
both shell and solid elements.

This cohesive material model outputs three traction s having units of force per unit area 
into the D3PLOT database rather than the usual six stress components.  The in plane 
shear traction t1 along the 1-2 edge replaces the x-stress, the orth ogonal in plane shear 
traction t2 replaces the y-stress, and the traction in the nor mal direction t3  replaces the z-
stress. 
 
 
Used in XFEM, TLS corresponding to |u1D6FF|twoCst |u1D4J6|u1D4JB  above equations is replaced with TLS2. Since 
the initially rigid cohesive law is used, element f ails only when the stress level reaches 
the SIGMAX and Λ|oneCst is only used to deﬁne the penetration stiﬀness in case of crack 
closing (compression). *MAT_186  *MAT_COHESIVE_GENERAL  
 *MAT_COHESIVE_GENERAL  
This is Material Type 186 and can be used only with  cohesive element fomulations; see 
the variable ELFORM in *SECTION_SOLID and *SECTION_ SHELL. The material 
model includes three general irreversible mixed-mod e interaction cohesive 
formulations with arbitrary normalized traction-sep aration law given by a load curve 
(TSLC).  These three formulations are diﬀerentiated  via the type of eﬀective separation 
parameter (TES). The interaction between fracture m odes I and II is considered, and 
irreversible conditions are enforced via a damage f ormulation (unloading/reloading 
path pointing to/from the origin). See remarks for details.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
TES Type of eﬀective separation parameter (ESP). 
EQ.0.0 or 1.0: a dimensional separation measure is used.  For 
the interaction between mode I and II, a mixed-
mode propagation criterion is used.  For 
TES = 0.0 this is a power-law, and for TES = 1.0 
this is the Benzeggagh- Kenane law [1996].  See 
remarks below. 
EQ.2.0: a dimensionless separation measure is used, 
which grasps for the interaction between mode I 
displacements and mode II displacements (simi- 
lar to MAT_ 185, but with damage and general 
traction-separation law).  See remarks below. 
TSLC Normalized traction-separation load curve ID. The curve must be 
normalized in both coordinates and must contain at least three 
points: (0.0, 0.0) , (|u1D7≠6|zeroCst, 1.0) , and (1.0, 0.0) , which represents the 
origin, the peak and the complete failure, respecti vely (see Figure 
M186-1 ). A platform can exist in the curve like the tri- linear TSLC 
(see MAT_185).

STFSF Penetration stiﬀness multiplier for compressi on. Factor =(1.0+
STFSF)  is used to scale the compressive stiﬀness, i.e. no scaling is 
done with STFSF = 0.0 (recommended). 
TSLC2 Normalized traction-separation load curve ID for Mode II. The 
curve must be normalized in both coordinates and mu st contain 
at least three points: (0.0, 0.0) , (|u1D7≠6|zeroCst, 1.0) , and (1.0, 0.0) , which 
represents the origin, the peak and the complete fa ilure, 
respectively (see Figure M186-1 ). If not speciﬁed, TSLC is used for 
Mode II behavior as well. 
Remarks: 
All three formulations have in common that the trac tion-separation behavior of this 
model is mainly given by |u1D43A/u1D4:C.st|u1D4J≠Cst and T for normal mode I, |u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st|u1D4J≠Cst and S for tangential mode II 
and an arbitrary normalized traction-separation loa d curve for both modes (see Figure 
M186-1 ). The maximum (or failure) separations are then gi ven by:

 First and second formulation (TES = 0.0 and TES = 1 .0): 
For mixed-mode behavior, three diﬀerent formulation s are possible (where default 
TES = 0.0 with XMU = 1.0 is recommended as a ﬁrst t ry).  Here, the total mixed-mode 
relative displacement |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst is deﬁned as  |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst=/radical.v2|u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st|twoCst+ |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st|twoCst, where |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st= |u1D6FF|threeCst is the separation in 
normal direction (mode I) and |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st=/radical.v2|u1D6FF|oneCst|twoCst+ |u1D6FF|twoCst|twoCst is the separation in tangential direction 
(mode II).  See Figure M186-2 . The ultimate mixed-mode displacement |u1D6FF|u1D439Cst (total failure) 
for the power law (TES = 0.0) is:

where |u1D6FD = |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st/|u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st is the “mode mixity”.  The larger the exponent XMU  is chosen, the 
larger the fracture toughness in mixed-mode situati ons will be.  In this model, damage 
of the interface is considered, i.e. irreversible c onditions are enforced with load- 
ing/unloading paths coming from/pointing to the ori gin.  This formulation is similar to 
MAT_COHESIVE_MIXED_MODE (MAT_138), but with the arb itrary traction-
separation law TSLC. 
Third formulation (TES = 2.0): 
Here, a dimensionless eﬀective separation parameter  |u1D7≠6 is used, which grasps for the 
interaction between relative displacements in norma l ( |u1D6FF|threeCst - mode I) and tangential ( |u1D6FF|oneCst,|u1D6FF|twoCst 
- mode II) directions:

where the Mc-Cauley bracket is used to distinguish between tension ( |u1D6FF|threeCst≥ 0) and 
compression ( |u1D6FF|threeCst< 0). |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st|u1D439Cst and |u1D6FF/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st|u1D439Cst are critical values, representing the maximum 
separations in the interface in normal and tangenti al direction .  For stress calculation, 
the normalized traction-separation load curve TSLC is used: |u1D461 = |u1D461|mCst|aCst|xCst × |u1D461̅(|u1D7≠6). This 
formulation is similar to MAT_COHESIVE_TH (MAT_185) , but with the arbitrary

Purpose: This is Material Type 187 (Semi-Analytical  Model for Polymers).  This material 
model uses an isotropic C-1 smooth yield surface fo r the description of non-reinforced 
plastics.  Details of the implementation are given in [Kolling, Haufe, Feucht and Du Bois 
2005]. 
This material law has been developed at DaimlerChry sler, Sindelﬁngen, in collaboration 
with Paul Du Bois and Dynamore, Stuttgart.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCID-T Load curve or table ID giving the yield stress as a  function of 
plastic strain.   These curves should be obtained f rom quasi- static 
and (optionally) dynamic uniaxial tensile tests.  T his input is 
mandatory, and the material model will not work unl ess at le ast 
one tensile stress-strain curve is given.  If LCID- T is a table ID, the 
table values are plastic strain rates, and a curve of yield stress 
versus plastic strain must be given for each of tho se strain rates.  
If the ﬁrst value in the table is negative, LS-DY NA assumes that 
all the table values represent the natural logarith m of plastic 
strain rate.  When the highest plastic strain rate is several orders 
of magnitude greater than the lowest strain rate, i t is 
recommended that the natural log of plastic strain rate be input in 
the table.  See Remark 4 . 
LCID-C Optional load curve ID giving the yield stress as a  function of 
plastic strain.  This curve should be obtained from  a quasi- static 
uniaxial compression test.   
LCID-S Optional load curve ID giving the yield stress as a  function of 
plastic strain.  This curve should be obtained from  a quasi- static 
shear test.   
LCID-B Optional load curve ID giving the yield stress as a  function of 
plastic strain, this curve should be obtained from a quasi- static 
biaxial tensile test. 
NUEP Plastic Poisson’s ratio: an estimated ratio of tran sversal to 
longitudinal plastic rate of deformation under unia xial loading 
should be given. 
LCID-P Load curve ID giving the plastic Poisson's ratio as a function of 
plastic strain during uniaxial tensile and uniaxial  compressive 
testing.  The plastic strain on the abscissa is neg ative for 
compression and positive for tension.    It is impo rtant to cover 
both tension and compression.  If LCID- P is given, NUEP is 
ignored. 
INCDAM Flag to control the damage evolution as a fu nction of triaxiality: 
EQ.0: Damage evolution is independent of the triaxiality.

true (meaning damaged) yield stress values can be u sed.  In this 
case an automatic stress-strain recalibration (AS SR) algorithm is 
activated.  The damage value must be deﬁned in the range 0≤

EPFAIL This parameter is the equivalent plastic strain at failure under 
uniaxial tensile loading (history variable #2).  If  EP FAIL is given 
as a negative integer, a load curve is expected tha t deﬁnes EP-
FAIL as a function of the plastic strain rate.  Def ault value is 10 5. 
DEPRPT Increment of equivalent plastic strain under  uniaxia l tensile 
loading (history variable #2) between failure point  and rupture 
point.  Stresses will fade out to zero between EPFA IL and EP-
FAIL + DEPRPT. If DE PRPT is given a negative value, a curve 
deﬁnition is expected where DEPRPT is deﬁned as fun ctio n of the 
triaxiality.

the value of EPFAIL depending on the triaxiality (t hat is, |u1D4JD/|u1D7≠∆v M ). 
For a triaxiality of -1/3 a value of 1.0 should be speciﬁed.

Load Curves: 
Material SAMP-1 uses three yield curves internally to evaluate a quadratic yield 
surface.  *MAT_SAMP-1 accepts four diﬀerent kinds o f yield curves, LCID-T, LCID-C, 
LCID-S, and LCID-B where data from tension tests (L CID-T) is always required, but the *MAT_187  *MAT_SAMP-1  
 others are optional.  If fewer than three curves ar e deﬁned, as indicated by setting the 
missing load curve IDs to 0, the remaining curves a re generated internally. 
1.  Fewer than 3 load curves.   In the case of fewer than 3 load curves, a linear  
yield surface in the invariant space spanned by the  pressure and the von Mises 
stress is generated using the available data.  See Figure M187-2 . 
2.  Three or more load curves.   See Figure M187-3 . 
Remarks: 
1.  Damage.   If the LCID-D is given, then a damage curve as a function of 
equivalent plastic strains acting on the stresses i s deﬁned as shown in Figure 
M187-4 . 
Since the damaging curve acts on the yield values, the inelastic results are 
aﬀected by the damage curve.  As a means to circumv ent this, the load curve 
LCID-D may be given a negative ID. This will lead t o an internal conversion of 
from nominal to eﬀective stresses (ASSR).  While th is conversion is possible for 
some combinations of yield curve deﬁnitions, plasti c Poisson’s ratio and dam- 
age curves, the corresponding inverse problem canno t be solved for all combi- 
nations.  An error message is provided in this case . Figure M187-4.   EPFAIL and DE PRPT deﬁned the failure and fading behavior

 2.  Unsolvable Yield Surface Case.   Since the generality of arbitrary curve 
inputs allows unsolvable yield surfaces, SAMP may m odify curves internally.  
This will always lead to warning messages at the be ginning of the simulation 
run.  One modiﬁcation that is not allowed are negat ive tangents of the last two 
data points of any of the yield curves. 
3.  RBCFAC.   If RBCFAC is nonzero and curves LCID-T, LCID-C, L CID-S, and 
LCID-B are speciﬁed, the yield surface in /u1D4:C|oneCst-|u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst|u1D4JACst  -stress space is constructed 
such that a piecewise-linear yield surface is activ ated.  This option can help 
promote convergence of the plasticity algorithm.  Figure M187-1  illustrates the 
eﬀect of RBCFAC on behavior in biaxial compression.   
4.  Dynamic Ampliﬁcation Factor for Yield Stress.   If LCID-T is given as a table 
specifying strain-rate scaling of the yield stress,  then the compressive, shear 
and biaxial yield stresses are computed by multiply ing their respective static 
values by dynamic ampliﬁcation factor (dynamic/stat ic ratio) of the tensile 
yield stress. 
5.  Instability Criterion.   Instability at an integration point is a value be tween 0 
and 1 indicating the integration point’s proximity to damage start.  If instabil- 
ity reaches 1, then damage starts and grows from 0 to 1. The element then 
“ruptures”.  The choice of INCFAIL determines how i nstability is calculated.  
For INCFAIL = 0, 
insta b ility = |parenleftCv1e q ui v alent plastic strain|parenriµhtCv1/EPFAIL 
6.  History Variables. This material has the following history variables.  NEIPH 
or NEIPS on *DATABASE_EXTENT_BINARY must be set for  the history data 
to be output.

Purpose: This is a slimmed-down form of Material Ty pe 187. In contrast to the original 
SAMP-1 the options here are limited to rate indepen dent or rate dependent ﬂow in 
tension and compression as well as constant or vari able plastic Poisson’s ratio.  Shear 
and biaxial test data are not incorporated.  Damage  and failure are not available here.  
*MAT_ADD_EROSION or *MAT_ADD_DAMAGE can be included  for damage and 
failure.  But as in the original model, a viscoelas tic extension can be activated.  
This model is based on a complete re-coding of the plasticity algorithm.  The eﬃciency 
was improved to the extent that the computing times  should be shorter.  As compared 
to *MAT_SAMP-1, results should diﬀer only slightly.   The main diﬀerence is the 
formulation for rate eﬀects: the viscoplastic formu lation (“VP = 1”) for *MAT_SAMP-1 
and the yield stress scaled using total strain rate  (“VP = 0”) for *MAT_SAMP_LIGHT.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCID-T Load curve or table ID giving the yield stress as a  function of 
plastic strain.   These curves should be obtained f rom quasi- static 
and (optionally) dynamic uniaxial tensile tests.  T his input is 
mandatory.  If LCID-T is a table ID, the table valu es are eﬀ ective 
strain rates, and a curve of yield stress as a func tion of plastic 
strain must be given for each of those strain rates .  If the ﬁrst 
value in the table is negative, LS-DY NA assumes that all the table 
values represent the natural logarithm of eﬀe ctive strain rate.  
When the highest eﬀective strain rate is several or ders of 
magnitude greater than the lowest strain rate, it i s recommended 
that the natural log of strain rate be input in the  table.  See 
Remark 1 . 
LCID-C Optional load curve (or table) ID giving the yield stress as a 
function of plastic strain (and strain rate).  This  curve (or table) 
should be obtained from uniaxial compression tests.   If LCID- C is 
deﬁned as a curve and LCID-T given as a table, then the rate 
dependence from the tension table is adopted in com pression as 
well.  See Remark 1 . 
CTFLG Curve treatment ﬂag (for LCID-T, LCID-C, and LCID-P) 
EQ.0: Rediscretized curves are used (default).  We recommend 
using this option together with an appropriate valu e of *MAT_SAMP_LIGHT  *MAT_187L  
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
LCINT for accurate resolution of the curves (see *D E-
FINE_CURVE and *CONTROL_SOLUTION). 
EQ.1: Original curve values from the input are used. 
RATEOP Calculation of eﬀective strain rate option: 
EQ.0: Original method for calculating the eﬀective strain  rate 
EQ.2: Improved method for calculating the eﬀective strain  rate.  
This method gives a slightly closer match to *MAT_-
SAMP-1 and is thus recommended.  
NUEP Plasti c Poisson’s ratio: an estimated ratio of transversa l to 
longitudinal plastic rate of deformation under unia xial loading 
should be given.  Ignored if LCID-P is nonzero.  Se e Remark 1 . 
LCID-P Load curve ID giving th e plastic Poisson's ratio as a function of an 
equivalent plastic strain measure during uniaxial t ensile and 
uniaxial compressive testing.  The plastic strain m easure on the 
abscissa is negative for compression and positive f or tension.  It is 
important to cover both tension and compression.  I f LCID- P is 
given, NUEP is ignored.  See Remark 1 . 
RFILTF Smoothing factor on the eﬀective strain rate (defau lt is 0.95).  The 
ﬁltered strain rate is used for the rate depen dent plastic ﬂow 
(LCID- T being a table) as well as for the viscoelasticity  
(LCEMOD > 0).  See Remark 2 .

Remarks: 
1.  Yield surfaces.   In the case of one tensile load curve (or table) LCID-T, the 
yield surface is von Mises type with associated (NU EP = 0.5) or non-associated 
(else) plastic ﬂow.  In the case LCID-T and LCID-C are both deﬁned, a Druck- 
er-Prager type yield surface is used.  The plastic ﬂow direction again depends 
on the choice of NUEP/LCID-P. 
The yield condition is given by

input as a constant with NUEP or as a function of e quivalent plastic strain with 
LCID-P.  The elasto-plastic equations are solved wi th a classical predictor-
corrector algorithm for the plastic strain incremen t ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst and stress /u1D̅48|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst. 
2.  Effective strain rate.  If tables are used for hardening, the rate depende nce is 
deﬁned by using an eﬀective strain rate.  To reduce  the noise from the elastic 
portion of that strain rate, an averaged value is u sed.  This is governed by the 
ﬁltering parameter RFILTF as shown above. 
3.  Nonlinear viscoelasticity . For LCEMOD ≠ 0, viscoelasticity is activated.  Wi th 
this model, EMOD becomes the Young’s modulus for eq uilibrium stress ( |u1D438e q ). 
LCEMOD speciﬁes the viscous Young’s modulus which i s a function of aver- 
aged strain rate ( |u1D438|u1D463Cst(|u1D7≠≠̇a v g )). BETA gives a constant decay parameter specifying  
the ratio |u1D438Cst/u1D463.sts(|u1D7≠≠Csṫa v g )
/u1Dℜ02.st(|u1D7≠≠Csṫa v g ) where |u1D7≠2 is the viscosity.  The viscoelastic stress-strain law is 
given by: 
|u1D7≠∆̇|u1D463Cst= −BETA × |u1D7≠∆(|u1D461) + |u1D438|u1D463Cst(|u1D7≠≠̇a v g ) × |u1D7≠≠̇a v g  
The one-dimensional viscoelastic behavior can be vi sualized by a generalized 
Maxwell cell as rheological model as shown in Figure M187-1 . 
We will be using the notation of the viscoelastic-p lastic stress update.  For sim- 
plicity we will discuss the one-dimensional case.  Let ∆|u1D7≠≠v p  be the viscoplastic 
strain increment and let |u1D7≠∆e q  and |u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst be the equilibrium and viscous stress por- 
tions.  The stress update is then: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D7≠∆e q |u1D4JBCst+|oneCst+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst 
or with stress increments: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst+ ∆|u1D7≠∆e q + ∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst. *MAT_SAMP_LIGHT  *MAT_187L  
 In the elastic trial-step the equilibrium and visco us stress increments ∆|u1D7≠∆e q tr  and 
∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D463Csttr  are calculated as: 
∆|u1D7≠∆e q tr = |u1D438e q × ∆|u1D7≠≠ 
and 
∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D463Csttr = |u1D438|u1D463Cst(|u1D7≠≠̇a v g )1 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/Delt∙.st|u1D461Cst
|u1D6FD∆|u1D461 (|u1D7≠≠̇a v g  ∆|u1D461) − |parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st/Delt∙.st|u1D461Cst|parenriµhtCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D463Cst|u1D4JBCst 
And the yield condition (see Remark 1 ) is evaluated: 
|u1D439|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst/co⋯⋯a.sttr |parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D439(|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst+ ∆|u1D7≠∆e q tr + ∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D463Csttr ). 
For |u1D439 ≤ 0  the trial stress state is the current stress, that  is, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst+ ∆|u1D7≠∆e q tr +
∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D463Csttr . Otherwise, the plastic strain increment ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst must be evaluated and the

of eﬀective plastic strain for that temperature.  The stress as a 
function of eﬀective plastic strain curve for the l owest value of 
temperature is used if the temperature falls below the minimum 
value.  Likewise, the stress as a function of eﬀect ive plastic strain 
curve for the highest value of temperat ure is used if the 
temperature exceeds the maximum value.  Card 2 is ignored with 
this option.

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
CRPLAW Creep law deﬁnition (see Remarks): 
EQ.0.0: Garofalo’s hyperbolic sine law (default) 
EQ.1.0: Norton’s power law 
Remarks: 
If LCSS is not deﬁned, the uniaxial stress-strain c urve has the form 
|u1D7≠∆|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D444|u1D4JFCst|oneCst/˙racketleft.v21 − exp|parenleftCv2−|u1D436|u1D4JFCst|oneCst|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2/˙racketright.v2+ |u1D444|u1D4JFCst|twoCst/˙racketleft.v21 − exp|parenleftCv2−|u1D436|u1D4JFCst|twoCst|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2/˙racketright.v2
+ |u1D444/u1D̅12.st|oneCst/˙racketleft.v21 − exp|parenleftCv2−|u1D436/u1D̅12.st|oneCst|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2/˙racketright.v2+ |u1D444/u1D̅12.st|twoCst/˙racketleft.v21 − exp|parenleftCv2−|u1D436/u1D̅12.st|twoCst|u1D7≠≠eff |u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2/˙racketright.v2. 
 
Viscous eﬀects are accounted for using the Cowper-S ymonds model, which scales the 
yield stress with the factor: 
1 + |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̇eff |u1D4JDCst
|u1D436|parenriµhtCv6|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
  . 
 
For CRPLAW = 0, the steady-state creep strain rate of Garafalo’s hyperbolic sine 
equation is given by 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J≠Cst= |u1D434[sinh(|u1D43J/u1D̅0F|u1D4J2Cst)]|u1D4JACstexp |parenleftCvJ−|u1D444
|u1D447|parenriµhtCvJ  . 
For CRPLAW = 1, the steady-state creep strain rate is given by Norton’s power law 
equation: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J≠Cst= |u1D434|parenleftCv1/u1D̅0F|u1D4J2Cst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D43JCst|u1D461|u1D4JACst. 
In the above, /u1D̅0F|u1D4J2Cst is the eﬀective elastic stress in the von Mises se nse, |u1D447 is the temperature 
and |u1D461 is the time.  The following is a schematic overvie w of the resulting stress update.  
The multiaxial creep strain increment is given by 
∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J≠Cst= ∆|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J≠Cst3/u1D̅4∫|u1D4J2Cst
2/u1D̅0F|u1D4J2Cst  , *MAT_188  *MAT_THERMO_ELASTO_VISCOPLASTIC_CREEP  
 where /u1D6D⃡|u1D4J2Cst is the elastic deviatoric stress tensor.  Similarl y, the plastic and thermal strain 
increments are given by 
∆/u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst= ∆/u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst3/u1D6D⃡|u1D4J2Cst
2/u1D̅0F|u1D4J2Cst
∆/u1D6C6|u1D447Cst= |u1D6F+|u1D461Cst+/Delt∙.st|u1D461Cst(|u1D447 − |u1D447ref )/u1D408−/u1D6C6|u1D461Cst|u1D447Cst 
where |u1D6F+ is the thermal expansion coeﬃcient (note the deﬁni tion compared to that of 
other materials).  Adding it all together, the stre ss update is given by 
/u1D6D4|u1D461Cst+/Delt∙.st|u1D461Cst=/u1D402|u1D461Cst+/Delt∙.st|u1D461Cst|parenleftCv2/u1D6C6|u1D461Cst|u1D4J2Cst+ ∆/u1D6C6− ∆/u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst− ∆/u1D6C6|u1D4J≠Cst− ∆/u1D6C6|u1D447Cst|parenriµhtCv2  . 
The plasticity is isotropic or kinematic but with a  von Mises yield criterion, the 
subscript in the equation above indicates the simul ation time of evaluation.  Internally, 
this stress update requires the solution of a nonli near equation in the eﬀective stress, the 
viscoelastic strain increment and potentially the p lastic strain increment.

This is  Material Type 190.  This model was developed by Bar lat and Lian [1989] for 
modeling sheets with anisotropic materials under pl ane stress conditions.  This material 
allows the use of the Lankford parameters for the d eﬁnition of the anisotropy.  This 
particular development is due to Barlat and Lian [1 989].  It has been modiﬁed to include 
a failure criterion based on the Forming Limit Diag ram.  The curve can be input as a 
load curve, or calculated based on the n-value and sheet thickness.

FLDCID Load curve ID deﬁning the Forming Limit Diagram.  M inor 
engineering strains in percent are deﬁned as abscis sa values and 
Major engineering strains in percent are deﬁn ed as ordinate 
values.  The forming limit diagram is shown in Figure M39-1 .  In 
deﬁning the curve list pairs of minor and major str ains starting 
with the left most point and ending with the right most point, see 
*DEFINE_CURVE. 
RN Hardening exponent equivalent to the n- value in a power law 
hardening law.  If the parameter FLD CID is not deﬁned, this 
value in combination with the value RT can be used to calculate a 
forming limit curve to allow for failure. 
RT Sheet thickness used for calculating a forming limi t curve.  This 
value does not override the sheet thickness in any way.  It is only 
used in conjunction with the parameter RN to calcul ate a forming 
limit curve if the parameter FLDCID is not deﬁned.   
FLDSAFE A safety oﬀset of the forming limit curve.  This va lue should be 
input as a percentage (ex.  10 not 0.10).  This saf ety margin will be 
applied to the forming limit curve deﬁned by FLD CID or the 
curve calculated by RN and RT. 
FLDNIPF Numerical integration points failure treatment. 
GT.0.0: The number of element integration points that must fail 
before  the element is deleted.  By default, if one  inte- 
gration point has strains above the forming limit c urve, 
the element is ﬂagged for deletion. 
LT.0.0: The element is deleted when all integration points 
within a relative distance of – FLDNIPF from the mid 
surface have failed (value between -1.0 and 0.0).

 Remarks: 
See material 36 for the theoretical basis. 
 
The forming limit curve can be input directly as a curve by specifying a load curve id 
with the parameter FLDCID.  When deﬁning such a cur ve, the major and minor strains 
must be input as percentages. 
 
Alternatively, the parameters RN and RT can be used  to calculate a forming limit curve.  
The use of RN and RT is not recommended for non-fer rous materials.  RN and RT are 
ignored if a non-zero FLDCID is deﬁned.

|u1D7≠≠ma jor fld  
corresponding to |u1D7≠≠|mCst|iCst|nCst /o.st/r.stwor k piece .  A value between 0 and 1 indicates that the strain s lie

forming limit curve. *MAT_191  *MAT_SEISMIC_BEAM

2.  FOFFS.  FOFFS oﬀsets the yield surface parallel to the axia l force axis.  It is the 
compressive axial force at which the maximum bendin g moment capacity 
about the local |u1D46≠-axis (determined by LCPMS and SFS) and that about the local 
|u1D461-axis (determined by LCPMT and SFT) occur.  For ste el beams and columns, 
the value of FOFFS is usually zero.  For reinforced  concrete beams, columns 
and shear walls, the maximum bending moment capacit y occurs correspond- 
ing to a certain compressive axial force, FOFFS. Th e value of FOFFS can be 
input as either positive or negative.  Internally, LS-DYNA converts FOFFS to, 
and regards compressive axial force as, negative. 
3.  FTYPE 4.   Interaction surface FTYPE 4 calculates a utilisat ion parameter using 
the yield force and moment data given on Card 2, bu t the elements remain 
elastic even when the forces or moments exceed yiel d values.  This is done for 
consistency with the design code OBE AISC LRFD (200 0).  The utilization cal- 
culation is as follows:

4.  FTYPE 5.   Interaction surface FTYPE 5 is similar to FTYPE 4  (calculates a 
utilization parameter using the yield data, but the  elements do not yield).  The 
equations are taken from Australian code AS4100. Th e user must select appro- 
priate values of |u1D6F+, |u1D6FD, |u1D6F∆ and |u1D6FF using the various clauses of Section 8 of AS4100. It 
is assumed that the local |u1D46≠-axis is the major axis for bending.

 5.  DEGRAD.   The option for degrading moment behavior changes the meaning of 
the plastic moment-rotation curve as follows: 
a)  If DEGRAD = 0 (not recommended), the |u1D46J-axis points on the curve repre- 
sent current plastic rotation (meaning total rotati on minus the elastic 
component of rotation).  This quantity can be posit ive or negative depend- 
ing on the direction of rotation; during hysteresis  the behavior will repeat- 
edly follow backwards and forwards along the same c urve.  The curve 
should include negative and positive rotation and m oment values.  This 
option is retained so that results from existing mo dels will be unchanged. 
b)  If DEGRAD = 1, the |u1D46J-axis points represent cumulative absolute plastic 
rotation.  This quantity is always positive and inc reases whenever there is 
plastic rotation in either direction.  Thus, during  hysteresis, the yield mo- 
ments are taken from points in the input curve with  increasingly positive 
rotation.  If the curve shows a degrading behavior (reducing moment with 
rotation), then, once degraded by plastic rotation,  the yield moment can 
never recover to its initial value.  This option ca n be thought of as having 
“fatigue-type” hysteretic damage behavior, where al l plastic cycles con- 
tribute to the total damage. 
c)  If DEGRAD = 2, the |u1D46J-axis points represent the high-tide value (always 
positive) of the plastic rotation.  This quantity i ncreases only when the ab- 
solute value of plastic rotation exceeds the previo usly recorded maximum.  
If smaller cycles follow a larger cycle, the plasti c moment during the small 
cycles will be constant, since the high-tide plasti c rotation is not altered by 
the small cycles.  Degrading moment-rotation behavi or is possible.  This 
option can be thought of as showing rotation-contro lled damage and fol- 
lows the FEMA approach for treating fracturing join ts. 
DEGRAD applies also to the axial behavior.  The sam e options are available as 
for rotation: DEGRAD = 0 gives unchanged behavior f rom previous versions; 
DEGRAD = 1 gives a fatigue-type behavior using cumu lative plastic strain; 
and DEGRAD = 2 gives FEMA-type behavior, where the axial load capacity 
depends on the high-tide tensile and compressive st rains.  The deﬁnition of 
strain for this purpose is according to ASFLAG on C ard 1 – it is expected that 
ASFLAG = 2 will be used with DEGRAD = 2. The “axial  strain” variable plot- 
ted by post-processors is the variable deﬁned by AS FLAG. 
The output variables plotted as “plastic rotation” have special meanings for 
this material model– note that hinges form only at Node 2.  “Plastic rotation at 
End 1” is really a high-tide mark of absolute plast ic rotation at Node 2, deﬁned 
as follows: 
a)  Current plastic rotation is the total rotation min us the elastic component 
of rotation. *MAT_SEISMIC_BEAM  *MAT_191  
 b)  Take the absolute value of the current plastic rot ation, and record the 
maximum achieved up to the current time.  This is t he high-tide mark of 
plastic rotation. 
If DEGRAD = 0, “Plastic rotation at End 2” is the c urrent plastic rotation at 
Node 2.  If DEGRAD = 1 or 2, “Plastic rotation at E nd 2” is the current total 
rotation at Node 2.  The total rotation is a more i ntuitively understood parame- 
ter, such as for plotting hysteresis loops.  Howeve r, with DEGRAD = 0, the 
previous meaning of that output variable has been r etained such that results 
from existing models are unchanged.  
FEMA thresholds are the plastic rotations at which the element is deemed to 
have passed from one category to the next, e.g. “El astic”, “Immediate Occu- 
pancy”, “Life Safe”, etc.  The high-tide plastic ro tation (maximum of Y and Z) 
is checked against the user-deﬁned limits FEMA1, FE MA2, etc.  The output 
ﬂag is then set to 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4: 0 means that t he rotation is less than FEMA1; 1 
means that the rotation is between FEMA1 and FEMA2,  and so on.  By con- 
touring this ﬂag, it is possible to see quickly whi ch joints have passed critical 
thresholds.  
6.  Output.   For this material model, special output parameter s are written to the 
d3plot  and d3thdt  ﬁles.  The number of output parameters for beam el ements 
is automatically increased to 20 (in addition to th e six standard resultants) 
when parts of this material type are present.  Some  post-processors may inter- 
pret this data as if the elements were integrated b eams with 4 integration 
points.  Depending on the post-processor used, the data may be accessed as 
follows: 
 
Extra Variable # (Integration 
Point 4 Description) Data Description 
16 (or Axial Stress) FEMA rotation ﬂag 
17 (or XY Shear Stress) current utilization 
18 (or ZX Shear Stress) maximum utilization to 
date 
20 (or Axial Strain) FEMA axial ﬂag 
“Utilization” is the yield parameter, where 1.0 is on the yield surface. *MAT_192  *MAT_SOIL_BRICK

Remarks: 
1.  Material Behavior and References.  The material model consists of up to 10 
nested elasto-plastic yield surfaces deﬁned in a tr ansformed stress-strain 
space, termed “BRICK” space.  The sizes of the yiel d surfaces are given in 
terms of BRICK strains and are called “string-lengt hs”.  Explanation of the *MAT_SOIL_BRICK  *MAT_192  
 input parameters and underlying concepts may be fou nd in Simpson (1992), 
Lehane & Simpson (2000), and Ellison et al (2012).  The input parameters cor- 
respond to those described in Ellison et al as foll ows:

CAP /u1D̅01 
See Table 3 in Ellison et al for example input para meter values. 
2.  Elastic Stiffness.  The elastic bulk modulus is given by |u1D4JD′/u1Dℜ04⁄, where |u1D4JD′ is the 
current mean effective stress (compression positive ), and the small-strain 
elastic shear modulus is calculated from the bulk m odulus and Poisson’s ratio 
RNU.  
3.  Nonlinear Stress-Strain Response. The curve RLCID deﬁnes the nonlinear 
behavior in terms of secant stiffness degradation.  The same curve is assumed 
to apply to all six BRICK stress-strain components.   For example, shear in the 
|u1D46J /u1D46̅-plane will follow the curve, such that the |u1D46J-axis points correspond to shear 
angle |u1D6F∆|u1D46JCst|u1D467Cst , while the |u1D466-axis contains |u1D43A |u1D43Amax ⁄ , where |u1D43A is the secant stiﬀness 
(equal to /u1D̅0F|u1D46JCst|u1D467Cst |u1D6F∆|u1D46JCst|u1D467Cst ⁄) and |u1D43A|u1D4JACst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D46JCst  is the small-strain elastic shear modulus.  
4.  Model Requirements.   This material type requires that the model be ori ented 
such that the /u1D46̅-axis is deﬁned in the upward direction.  Compressi ve initial 
stress must be deﬁned, using, for example, *INITIAL _STRESS_SOLID or *INI-*MAT_192  *MAT_SOIL_BRICK  
 TIAL_STRESS_DEPTH. Stresses must remain compressive  throughout the 
analysis. 
5.  Units.   The recommended unit system is kiloNewtons, meter s, seconds, tonnes.  
There are some built-in defaults that assume stress  units of kN/m 2. 
6.  Over-Consolidated Clays.   Over-consolidated clays have suﬀered previous 
loading to higher stress levels than are present at  the start of the analysis due 
to phenomena such as ice sheets during previous ice  ages, or the presence of 
soil or rock that has subsequently been eroded.  Th e maximum vertical stress 
during that time is assumed to be: 
|u1D7≠∆V ,MAX = RO × GRA V × (PGCL − |u1D44Del )  , 
where 
RO, GRA V , and PGCL = input parameters 
|u1D44Del =z coordinate of center of element  
Since that time, the material has been unloaded unt il the vertical stress equals 
the user-deﬁned initial vertical stress.  The previ ous load/unload history has a 
signiﬁcant eﬀect on the subsequent behavior.  For e xample, the horizontal 
stress in an over-consolidated clay may be greater than the vertical stress. 
7.  Initialization.  This material model initializes each element with a  load/unload 
cycle under uniaxial vertical strain conditions.  T he element is loaded up to a 
vertical stress of |u1D7≠∆V,MAX  (deﬁned in Remark 6  above) and then unloaded to the 
user-deﬁned initial vertical stress |u1D7≠∆V, U SER  (see *INITIAL_STRESS_SOLID or 
*INITIAL_STRESS_DEPTH).  During this initialization  cycle, the stresses and 
history variables are updated using the same consti tutive behavior as during 
the main analysis.  Therefore, the horizontal stres s at the start of the analysis 
|u1D7≠∆H,ACT U AL  (as seen in the results ﬁles at time zero) is an o utput of the initializa- 
tion process and will be diﬀerent from the user-deﬁ ned initial horizontal stress 
|u1D7≠∆H,USER ; the latter is ignored.  Optionally, initializatio n may be switched to a 
load/unload/reload cycle (see input settings of THE ORY).  In this case, the 
element is loaded up to a vertical stress of |u1D7≠∆V,MAX , unloaded to a stress |u1D7≠∆V,MIN  
which is less than |u1D7≠∆V, U SER , and then reloaded to |u1D7≠∆V, U SER . The value of |u1D7≠∆V,MIN  is 
calculated automatically to try to minimize the diﬀ erence between |u1D7≠∆H,ACT U AL  
and |u1D7≠∆H,USER .  
8.  Material Subroutine Version.   This material model is developed for a 
Geotechnical FE program (Oasys Ltd.’s SAFE) written  by Arup.  The default 
THEORY = 0 gives a vectorized version ported from S AFE in the 1990’s.  Since 
then the material model has been developed further in SAFE, with versions 
ported to LS-DYNA in 2003 (THEORY = 4 and 104) and 2015 (THEORY = 204 
and 304); these are not vectorized and will run mor e slowly on most computer *MAT_SOIL_BRICK  *MAT_192  
 platforms.  Nevertheless, the 2015 version is recom mended.  THEORY = 0, 4, 
and 104 are retained only for backward compatibilit y. 
9.  Shape Factor.   The shape factor for a typical soil would be 1.25 .  Do not use 
values higher than 1.35.  
10.  Anisotropy.   Anisotropy is treated by applying stretch factors  to the strain axis 
of the stress-strain curves for certain BRICK shear  components.  It may be de- 
ﬁned by either  using THEORY = 204 or 304 together with RVHHH on C ard 3b 
or  using THEORY = 7 or 107 with the parameters on Car d 3c.  Using THEO-
RY = 4 or 104 with non-zero anisotropy parameters o n Card 3a is permitted but 
not recommended.  See Ellison et al (2012) for desc ription of the anisotropy 
eﬀects modelled by THEORY = 7/107 and the meaning o f the parameters on 
Card 3c.  If anisotropy is not required, use THEORY  = 204 or 304 and leave 
Card 3b blank.  “Vertical” and “horizontal” are deﬁ ned in the global coordi- 
nate system with “vertical” being the global /u1D46̅-axis. 
11.  TOL and SUBINC.   These parameters usually have little inﬂuence on the 
result.  Smaller values may sometimes improve accur acy, at cost of greater run 
times.  
12.  Creep.  Creep is implemented by scaling the strain “string  lengths” (see RL-
CID) as a function of strain rate: 
|u1D446 = SLRATIO × |u1D446RLCID |<racketleftCvJ1 + BETAC ×/u1D45∫|u1D4JB |parenleftCvJ||u1D7≠≠̇|
|u1D7≠≠̇ref + 1|parenriµhtCvJ |<racketriµhtCvJ 
Where  |u1D446 is string length; |u1D446|u1D44JCst|u1D43FCst /u1D4:6.st/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:̅.st  are the string lengths in the curve RLCID; 
SLRATIO and BETAC are input parameters on Card 4; ||u1D7≠≠̇| is strain rate; and |u1D7≠≠̇ref  
is input parameter EPSDOT1 or EPSDOT2 for volumetri c and shear strains, 
respectively.  Note that SLRATIO × |u1D446RLCID  gives the string lengths for zero 
strain rate.

Purpose:  This is Material Type 194. It is for shel l elements only.  It uses empirically-
derived algorithms to model the eﬀect of cyclic she ar loading on reinforced concrete 
walls.  It is primarily intended for modeling squat  shear walls, but can also be used for 
slabs.  Because the combined eﬀect of concrete and reinforcement is included in the 
empirical data, crude meshes can be used.  The mode l has been designed such that the 
minimum amount of input is needed: generally, only the variables on the ﬁrst card need 
to be deﬁned. 
NOTE:  This material does not support speciﬁcation of a m a- 
terial angle, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst, for each through-thickness integra- 
tion point of a shell.

This used to convert the ultimate tensile stress of  concrete which 
is expressed as /radical.v1FC  where FC is given in PSI. Therefore a unit

by *DEFINE_COORDINATE_NODES. 
EQ.2.0: globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below, as with *DEFINE_COORDI-

BETA Material angle in degrees for AOPT = 0 and 3, may be overridden

Remarks: 
The element is linear elastic except for in-plane s hear and tensile cracking eﬀects.  
Crushing due to direct compressive stresses are mod eled only insofar as there is an in-*MAT_194  *MAT_RC_SHEAR_WALL  
 plane shear stress component.  It is not recommende d that this model be used where 
nonlinear response to direct compressive or loads i s important. 
 
Note that the in-plane shear stress |u1D461|u1D46JCst|u1D466Cst  is deﬁned as the shear stress in the element’s loc al 
|u1D46J-|u1D466 plane.  This is not necessarily equal to the maxim um shear stress in the plane: for 
example, if the principal stresses are at 45 degree s to the local axes, |u1D461|u1D46JCst|u1D466Cst  is zero.  
Therefore it is important to ensure that the local axes are appropriate - for a shear wall 
the local axes should be vertical or horizontal.  B y default, local |u1D46J points from node 1 to 
node 2 of the element.  It is possible to change th e local axes by using AOPT > 0. 
 
If TMAX is set to zero, the ultimate shear stress i s calculated using a formula in the 
Uniform Building Code 1997, section 1921.6.5: 
TMAX U BC =U CON V × ALP H A ×/radical.v1FC + RO × F Y  
where, 
U CON V = unit con v ersion factor, see v arria b le list 
ALP H A = aspect ratio 
= 2.0 for ℎ/u1D45∫⁄∈(2.0,∞) increases linearly to 3.0 for ℎ/u1D45∫⁄∈(2.0,1.5) 
FC = unconfined compressi v e strength of concrete 
RO = fraction of reinforcement 
= |parenleftCv1percent reinforcement|parenriµhtCv1 100 ⁄
F Y = yield stress of reinforcement   
To this we add shear stress due to the overburden t o obtain the ultimate shear stress: 
TMAX U BC = TMAX U BC + SIG0 
where 
SIG0 = in plane compressi v e stress under static e q uili b rium conditions 
 
The UBC formula for ultimate shear stress is genera lly conservative (predicts that the 
wall is weaker than shown in test), sometimes by 50 % or more.  A less conservative 
formula is that of Fukuzawa: 
TMAX = max |<racketleftCvJ|parenleftCvJ0.4 +|u1D434|u1D4J≠Cst
|u1D434|u1D464Cst|parenriµhtCvJ , 1|<racketriµhtCvJ× 2.7× |parenleftCvJ1.9+|u1D44≠
/u1D4:F|u1D463Cst|parenriµhtCvJ ×U CON V + /radical.v1FC + 0.5
× RO × F Y + SIG0 
where 
|u1D434/u1D4:6.st= Cross-sectional area of stiffening features such a s columns or flanges 
|u1D434|u1D464Cst= Cross-sectional area of wall 
|u1D44≠/u1D4:F|u1D463Cst⁄ = Aspect ratio of wall height length ⁄  *MAT_RC_SHEAR_WALL  *MAT_194  
 Other terms are as above.  This formula is not incl uded in the material model: TMAX 
should be calculated by hand and entered on Card 1 if the Fukuzawa formula is 
required. 
 
It should be noted that none of the available formu lae, including Fukuzawa, predict the 
ultimate shear stress accurately for all situations .  Variance from the experimental 
results can be as great as 50%. 
 
The shear stress vs shear strain curve is then cons tructed automatically as follows, using 
the algorithm of Fukuzawa extended by Arup: 
1.  Assume ultimate engineering shear strain, |u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst= 0.004 8 
2.  First point on curve, corresponding to concrete cr acking, is at 
|parenleftCvJ0.3 ×TMAX 
|u1D43A, 0.3 × TMAX|parenriµhtCvJ, 
where |u1D43A is the elastic shear modulus given by 
|u1D43A =|u1D438
2(1 +/u1D̅08). 
3.  Second point, corresponding to the reinforcement y ield, is at 
(0.5 × |u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst, 0.8× TMAX). 
4.  Third point, corresponding to the ultimate strengt h, is at 
(|u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst, TMAX). 
5.  Fourth point, corresponding to the onset of streng th reduction, is at 
(2|u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst,TMAX). 
6.  Fifth point, corresponding to failure is at 
(3|u1D6F∆|u1D462Cst, 0.6 × TMAX). 
 
After failure, the shear stress drops to zero.  The  curve points can be entered by the user 
if desired, in which case they over-ride the automa tically calculated curve.  However, it 
is anticipated that in most cases the default curve  will be preferred due to ease of input. 
Hysteresis follows the algorithm of Shiga as for th e squat shear wall spring (see *MAT_-
SPRING_SQUAT_SHEARWALL).  The hysteresis constants which are deﬁned in ﬁelds 
A, B, C, D, and E can be entered by the user if des ired, but it is generally recommended 
that the default values be used. 
Cracking in tension is checked for the local x and y directions only – this is calculated 
separately from the in-plane shear.  A trilinear re sponse is assumed, with turning points 
at concrete cracking and reinforcement yielding.  T he three regimes are: *MAT_194  *MAT_RC_SHEAR_WALL  
 1.  Pre-cracking, linear elastic response is assumed u sing the overall Young’s 
Modulus on Card 1. 
2.  Cracking occurs in the local x or y directions when  the tensile stress in that 
direction exceeds the concrete tensile strength FT (if not input on Card 2, this 
defaults to 8% of the compressive strength FC).  Po st-cracking, a linear stress-
strain response is assumed up to reinforcement yiel d at a strain deﬁned by 
reinforcement yield stress divided by reinforcement  Young’s Modulus. 
3.  Post-yield, a constant stress is assumed (no work hardening). 
Unloading returns to the origin of the stress-strai n curve.  
For compressive strains the response is always line ar elastic using the overall 
Young’s Modulus on Card 1. 
If insuﬃcient data is entered, no cracking occurs i n the model.  As a minimum, 
FC and FY are needed. 
Extra variables are available for post-processing a s follows: 
Extra variable 1: Current engineering shear strain 
Extra variable 2: Shear status:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5– see below 
Extra variable 3: Maximum direct strain so far in l ocal |u1D46J direction (for ten- 
sile cracking) 
Extra variable 4: Maximum direct strain so far in l ocal |u1D466 direction (for ten- 
sile cracking)  
Extra variable 5: Tensile status: 0, 1 or 2 = elast ic, cracked, or yielded re- 
spectively. 
The shear status shows how far along the shear stre ss-strain curve each element 
has progressed, e.g. status 2 means that the elemen t has passed the second 
point on the curve.  These status levels correspond  to performance criteria in 
building design codes such as FEMA. *MAT_CONCRETE_BEAM  *MAT_195  
 *MAT_CONCRETE_BEAM  
This is  Material Type 195 for beam elements.  An elasto-pla stic material with an 
arbitrary stress as a function of strain curve and arbitrary strain rate dependency can be 
deﬁned.  Failure based on a plastic strain or a min imum time step size can be deﬁned.

Remarks: 
The stress strain behavior may be treated using a b ilinear stress strain curve through 
deﬁning the tangent modulus, ETAN. An eﬀective stre ss as a function of eﬀective 
plastic strain curve (LCSS) may be input instead of  deﬁning ETAN.  The cost is roughly 
the same for either approach.  The most general app roach is to use the table deﬁnition 
(LCSS) discussed below. 
 
Three options to account for strain rate eﬀects are  possible. 
1.  Strain rate may be accounted for using the Cowper and Symonds model which 
scales the yield stress with the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JDCst/fraction.v2
 
where |u1D7≠≠̇ is the strain rate.  |u1D7≠≠̇=/radical.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst . 
2.  For complete generality a load curve (LCSR) to sca le the yield stress may be 
input instead.  In this curve the scale factor as a  function of strain rate is de- 
ﬁned. 
3.  If diﬀerent stress as a function of strain curves can be provided for various 
strain rates, the option using the reference to a t able (LCSS) can be used. *MAT_196  *MAT_GENERAL_SPRING_DISCRETE_BEAM  
 *MAT_GENERAL_SPRING_DISCRETE_BEAM  
This is Material Type 196.  This model permits elas tic and elastoplastic springs with 
damping to be represented with a discrete beam elem ent of type 6 by using six springs 
each acting about one of the six local degrees-of-f reedom.  For elastic behavior, a load 
curve deﬁnes force or moment as a function of displ acement or rotation.  For inelastic 
behavior, a load curve deﬁnes yield force or moment  as a function of plastic deﬂection 
or rotation, which can vary in tension and compress ion. 
The two nodes deﬁning a beam may be coincident to g ive a zero length beam or oﬀset 
to give a ﬁnite length beam.  For ﬁnite length disc rete beams, the absolute value of the 
ﬁeld SCOOR in the *SECTION_BEAM input should be set  to a value of 2.0, which 
causes the local |u1D4JF-axis to be aligned along the two nodes of the beam  to give physically 
correct behavior.  The distance between the nodes o f a beam should not aﬀect the 
behavior of this material model.  A triad is used t o orient the beam for the directional 
springs.

FLCID Load curve ID (see *DEFINE_CURVE).   
TYPE.EQ.0: this curve deﬁnes force or moment as a function of 
deﬂection for nonlinear elastic behavior.   
TYPE.EQ.1: this curve deﬁnes the yield force as a function of 
plastic deﬂection.  If the abscissa of the ﬁrst poi nt 
of the curve is 0. the force magnitude i s identical in 
tension and compression, that is, only the sign 
changes.  If not, the yield stress in the compressi on 
is used when the spring force is negative.  The 
plastic displacement increases monotonically in 
this implementation.  The load curve is req uired 
input. 
HLCID Optional load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning force as a 
function of relative velocity.  If the origin of th e curve is at (0,0) , 
the force magnitude is identical for a given magnit ude of the 
relative velocity, meaning only the sign changes.

DLE Factor to scale time units 
GLCID Optional load curve ID (see *DEFINE_ CURVE) deﬁning a scale 
factor as a function of deﬂection for load curve ID , HLCID.  If 
zero, a scale factor of unity is assumed. 
Remarks: 
1.  Elastic Behavior.   If TYPE = 0, elastic behavior is obtained.  In th is case, if the 
linear spring stiﬀness is used, the force, |u1D439, is given by: 
|u1D439 = K × ∆/u1D4:F+ D × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ  . 
But if the load curve ID is speciﬁed, the force is then given by: *MAT_GENERAL_SPRING_DISCRETE_BEAM  *MAT_196  
 |u1D439 = |u1D43∆ |u1D4J3 (∆/u1D4:F) |<racketleftCv61 + C1 × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ+ C2 × sgn|parenleftCv1∆/u1D4:Ḟ|parenriµhtCv1ln |parenleftCv6max /˙raceleft.v61. ,|dividesCv2∆/u1D4:Ḟ|dividesCv2

+ |u1D4J4(∆/u1D4:F)ℎ|parenleftCv1∆/u1D4:Ḟ|parenriµhtCv1  . 
In these equations, ∆/u1D4:F is the change in length  
∆/u1D4:F= current length − initial length 
For the ﬁrst three degrees of freedom the ﬁelds on Cards 2 and 3 have dimen- 
sions as shown below.  Being angular in nature, the  next three degrees of free- 
dom involve moment instead of force and angle inste ad of length but are 
otherwise identical.

2.  Inelastic Behavior.   If TYPE = 1, inelastic behavior is obtained.  A t rial force is 
computed as: 
|u1D439|u1D447Cst= |u1D439|u1D4JBCst+ |u1D43∆ × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ(∆|u1D461) 
and the yield force is taken from the load curve: 
|u1D439/u1D44C.st= |u1D439|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2∆/u1D4:F/p.st/l.st|aCst|sCst|tCst|iCst /c.st|parenriµhtCv2  , 
where /u1D4:F/p.st/l.st|aCst|sCst|tCst|iCst /c.st is the plastic deﬂection, given by  
∆/u1D4:F/p.st/l.st|aCst|sCst|tCst|iCst /c.st=|u1D439|u1D447Cst− |u1D439/u1D44C.st
|u1D446 + |u1D43∆|mCst|aCst|xCst   . 
The maximum elastic stiﬀness is |u1D43∆|mCst|aCst|xCst = max(|u1D43∆, 2 × |u1D446|mCst|aCst|xCst ), where |u1D446 is the slope 
of FLCID. The trial force is checked against the yi eld force to determine |u1D439: 
|u1D439 = |<raceleftCvJ|u1D439/u1D44C.stif  |u1D439|u1D447Cst> |u1D439/u1D44C.st
|u1D439|u1D447Cstif  |u1D439|u1D447Cst≤ |u1D439/u1D44C.st 
The ﬁnal force, which includes rate eﬀects and damp ing, is given by: *MAT_196  *MAT_GENERAL_SPRING_DISCRETE_BEAM  
 |u1D439|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D439 × |<racketleftCv61 + C1 × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ+ C2 × sgn|parenleftCv1∆/u1D4:Ḟ|parenriµhtCv1ln |parenleftCv6max /˙raceleft.v61. ,|dividesCv2∆/u1D4:Ḟ|dividesCv2
DLE /˙raceright.v6|parenriµhtCv6|<racketriµhtCv6 + D × ∆/u1D4:Ḟ
+ |u1D4J4(∆/u1D4:F)ℎ|parenleftCv1∆/u1D4:Ḟ|parenriµhtCv1  . 
Unless the origin of the curve starts at (0,0) , the negative part of the curve is 
used when the spring force is negative where the ne gative of the plastic dis- 
placement is used to interpolate, |u1D439|u1D466Cst.  The positive part of the curve is used 
whenever the force is positive.  
3.  Cross-Sectional Area.  The cross-sectional area is deﬁned on the section c ard 
for the discrete beam elements, See *SECTION_BEAM.  The square root of this 
area is used as the contact thickness oﬀset if thes e elements are included in the 
contact treatment. 
4.  Rotational Displacement.   Rotational displacement is measured in radians. *MAT_SEISMIC_ISOLATOR  *MAT_197  
 *MAT_SEISMIC_ISOLATOR  
This is  Material Type 197 for discrete beam elements.  Slid ing (pendulum) and 
elastomeric seismic isolation bearings can be model ed, applying bi-directional coupled 
plasticity theory.  The hysteretic behavior was pro posed by Wen [1976] and Park, Wen, 
and Ang [1986].  The sliding bearing behavior is re commended by Zayas, Low and 
Mahin [1990].  The algorithm used for implementatio n was presented by  Nagarajaiah, 
Reinhorn, and Constantinou [1991].  Further options  for tension-carrying friction 
bearings are as recommended by Roussis and Constant inou [2006].  Element 
formulation type 6 must  be used.  Local axes are deﬁned on *SECTION_BEAM; the 
default is the global axis system.  The local /u1D46̅-axis is expected to be vertical.  On *SEC-
TION_BEAM SCOOR must be set to zero when using this  material model, even if the 
element has non-zero initial length.

Remarks: 
1.  Horizontal Behavior of the Isolator.   The horizontal behavior for all isolator 
types is governed by plastic history variables Zx a nd Zy that evolve according 
to equations given in the reference; A, GAMMA, BETA  and DISPYt are the 
input parameters for this.  The intention is to pro vide smooth build-up, rota- 
tion and reversal of forces in response to bidirect ional displacement histories in *MAT_SEISMIC_ISOLATOR  *MAT_197  
 the horizontal plane.  The theoretical model has be en correlated to experiments 
on seismic isolators. 
2.  Sliding Surface for Sliding Isolator.   The RADX and RADY inputs for the 
sliding isolator are optional.  If left blank, the sliding surface is assumed to be 
ﬂat.  A cylindrical surface is obtained by deﬁning either RADX or RADY; a 
spherical surface can be deﬁned by setting RADX = R ADY. The eﬀect of the 
curved surface is to add a restoring force proporti onal to the horizontal dis- 
placement from the center.  As seen in elevation, t he top of the isolator will 
follow a curved trajectory, lifting as it displaces  away from the center. 
3.  Vertical Behavior of the Isolator.  The vertical behavior for all types is linear 
elastic, but with diﬀerent stiﬀnesses for tension a nd compression.  By default, 
the tensile stiﬀness is zero for the sliding types.   For the elastomeric type in the 
case of uplift, the tensile stiﬀness will be diﬀere nt from the compressive stiﬀ- 
ness.  For the sliding type, compression is treated  as linear elastic, but no ten- 
sion can be carried. 
4.  Vertical Preload.  Vertical preload can be modeled either explicitly (for 
example, by deﬁning gravity), or by using the PRELO AD input.  PRELOAD 
does not lead to any application of vertical force to the model.  It is added to 
the compression in the element before calculating t he friction force and ten- 
sile/compressive vertical behavior. 
5.  Overview of ITYPE.   Various settings of ITYPE are described as follow s. 
a)  ITYPE = 0 is used to model a single (spherical) pe ndulum bearing.  Triple 
pendulum bearings can be modelled using three of th ese elements in se- 
ries, following the method described by Fenz and Co nstantinou 2008. 
b)  ITYPE = 2 is intended to model uplift-prevention s liding isolators that 
consist of two perpendicular curved beams joined by  a connector that can 
slide in slots on both beams.  The beams are aligne d in the local |u1D46J and |u1D466 
axes, respectively.  The vertical displacement is t he sum of the displace- 
ments induced by the respective curvatures and slid er displacements 
along the two beams.  Single-axis sliding is obtain ed by using YLOCK to 
lock the local |u1D466 displacement.  To resist uplift, STIFFTS must be d eﬁned 
(recommended value: same as STIFFV).  This isolator  type allows for 
diﬀerent friction coeﬃcients on each beam as well a s diﬀerent values in 
tension and compression.  The total friction, takin g into account sliding 
velocity and the friction history functions, is ﬁrs t calculated using FMAX 
which applies to the local |u1D46J-axis when in compression, and then scaled as 
necessary, such as by FMAXXT/FMAX (for the local |u1D46J-axis when in ten- 
sion) and by FMAXYC/FMAX or FMAXYT/FMAX for the |u1D466-axis as ap- 
propriate.  For this reason, FMAX should not be zer o. *MAT_197  *MAT_SEISMIC_ISOLATOR  
 c)  ITYPE = 3 is used to model Lead Rubber Bearings (L RB), made of rubber 
with a lead core. Phenomenological models following  Kumar et al.  (2014) 
are incorporated to simulate the following salient behavior:  
i)  The properties of the lead core may degrade in the  short-term be- 
cause of substantial internal heat generation from cyclic defor- 
mation. 
ii)  Under larger lateral deformation, the rubber may e xperience net 
tension which will aﬀect the compression and tensio n stiﬀness, 
and lead to potential vertical instability. 
iii)  Cavitation may happen when the bearing is under ex cessive ten- 
sion, resulting in permanent damage in the tensile capacity. 
d)  ITYPE  =  4 is used to model higher damping rubber  bearings.  It diﬀers 
from elastomeric bearing (ITYPE  =  1) in that the time-varying yield force 
is a function of resultant horizontal displacement,  governed by: 
Y ield force = FORCE Y 
⎝⎜⎜⎛1 + BETA |parenleftCv6|u1D4J1|u1D46J |twoCst+ |u1D4J1|u1D466 |twoCst
DISP Y |twoCst|parenriµhtCv6
⎠⎟⎟⎞  . 
Here |u1D4J1|u1D46J  and |u1D4J1|u1D466  are the displacements in the local |u1D46J and |u1D466 directions. 
e)  ITYPE = 5 is the same as ITYPE = 0 (spherical slid ing bearing), except for 
the additional capability of yielding and failure o f the rim, also called the 
retaining ring.  The rim is intended to prevent the  radial displacement of 
the slider exceeding RADB, but if suﬃcient radial f orce is applied, the rim 
can yield and then fail, leading to the slider fall ing oﬀ the supporting sur- 
face.  When the rim fails, the isolator element is deleted.   
6.  Damping. DAMP is the fraction of critical damping for free v ertical vibration 
of the isolator, based on the mass of the isolator (including any attached 
lumped masses) and its vertical stiﬀness.  The visc osity is reduced automatical- 
ly if it would otherwise infringe numerical stabili ty.  Damping is generally 
recommended:  
a)  Oscillations in the vertical force have a direct e ﬀect on friction forces in 
sliding isolators. 
b)  For isolators with curved surfaces, vertical oscil lations can be excited as 
the isolator slides up and down the curved surface.   
It may occasionally be necessary to increase DAMP i f these oscillations become 
signiﬁcant. *MAT_SEISMIC_ISOLATOR  *MAT_197  
 7.  Rotational Stiffness.  By default, this element has no rotational stiﬀness  - a 
pin joint is assumed.  However, if required, “oﬀset  moments” can be generated 
according to the vertical load multiplied by the la teral displacement of the iso- 
lator.  This is invoked using MX1, MX2, MY1, MY2. T he moment about  the local 
|u1D46J-axis (meaning the moment that is dependent on late ral displacement in the 
local |u1D466-direction) is reacted on nodes 1 and 2 of the elem ent in the proportions 
MX1 and MX2, respectively.  Similarly, moments abou t the local |u1D466-axis are 
reacted in the proportions MY1 and MY2. These input s eﬀectively determine 
the location of the pin joint.  
For example, consider an isolator installed between  the top of the foundation 
of a building (Node 1 of the isolator element) and the base of a column of the 
superstructure (Node 2 of the isolator element).  T o model a pin at the base of 
the column and react the oﬀset moment on the founda tion, set 
MX1 = MY1 = 1.0 and MX2 = MY2 = 0.0. For the same m odel, MX1 = MY1 = 0.0 
and MX2 = MY2 = 1.0 would imply a pin at the top of  the foundation - all the 
moment is transferred to the column.  Some isolator  designs have the pin at the 
bottom for moments about one horizontal axis, and a t the top for the other axis 
- these can be modeled by setting MX1 = MY2 = 1.0 a nd MX2 = MY1 = 0.0. 
MX1, MX2, MY1 and MY2 are all expected to be greate r than or equal to 0 and 
less than or equal to 1. Also, if MX1 and MX2 are n ot both zero, then 
MX1 + MX2 is expected to equal 1.0, and similarly f or MY1 and MY2. Howev- 
er, no error checks are performed to ensure this. 
Optionally, rotational stiﬀnesses that resist rotat ion of Node 2 relative to Node 
1 may be deﬁned on Card 9 .  These moments are applied equal and opposite 
on Nodes 1 and 2, irrespective of the settings of M X1, MX2, MY1 and MY2.    
8.  Density.   Density should be set to a reasonable value, say 2000 to 8000 kg/m 3. 
The element mass will be calculated as density × vo lume (volume is entered on 
*SECTION_BEAM). 
9.  SECTION_BEAM Input.  Note on values for *SECTION_BEAM: 
a)  Set ELFORM to 6 (discrete beam). 
b)  VOL (the element volume) might typically be set to  0.1 m3. 
c)  INER always needs to be non-zero.  It will inﬂuenc e the solution only 
when the element has rotational stiﬀness, that is, when any of MX1, MX2, 
MY1, MY2, KTHX, KTHY or KTHZ are non-zero.  A reaso nable value 
might be 10-20 kg-m2. 
d)  CID can be left blank if the isolator is aligned i n the global coordinate sys- 
tem, otherwise a coordinate system should be refere nced. *MAT_197  *MAT_SEISMIC_ISOLATOR  
 e)  By default, the isolator will be assumed to rotate  with the average rotation 
of its two nodes.  If the base of the column rotate s slightly the isolator will 
no longer be perfectly horizontal: this can cause u nexpected vertical dis- 
placements coupled with the horizontal motion.  To avoid this, rotation of 
the local axes of the isolator can be eliminated by  setting RRCON, SR-
CON, and TRCON to 1.0. This does not introduce any rotational restraint 
to the model, it only prevents the orientation of t he isolator from changing 
as the model deforms. 
f)  SCOOR must be set to zero. 
g)  All other parameters on *SECTION_BEAM can be left blank. 
10.  Post-Processing Note. As with other discrete beam material models, the 
force described in some post-processors as “Axial” is really the force in the 
local |u1D46J-direction; “Y-Shear” is really the force in the lo cal |u1D466-direction; and “Z-
Shear” is really the force in the local /u1D46̅-direction. *MAT_JOINTED_ROCK  *MAT_198  
 *MAT_JOINTED_ROCK  
This is Material Type 198. Joints (planes of weakne ss) are assumed to exist throughout 
the material at a spacing small enough to be consid ered ubiquitous.  The planes are 
assumed to lie at constant orientations deﬁned on t his material card.  Up to three planes 
can be deﬁned for each material.  See *MAT_MOHR_COU LOMB (*MAT_173) for a 
preferred alternative to this material model.

LOCAL EQ.0:  DIP and DIPANG are with respect to the global axes  
Remarks: 
1.  The joint plane orientations are deﬁned by the ang le of a “downhill vector” 
drawn on the plane, i.e. the vector is oriented wit hin the plane to obtain the 
maximum possible downhill angle.  DIP is the angle of this line below the hor- 
izontal.  DIPANG is the plan-view angle of the line  (pointing down hill) meas- 
ured clockwise from the global Y-axis about the glo bal Z-axis. 
2.  The joint planes rotate with the rigid body motion  of the elements, irrespective 
of whether their initial deﬁnitions are in the glob al or local axis system. 
3.  The full facilities of the modiﬁed Drucker Prager model for the matrix material 
can be used – see description of Material type 193.  Alternatively, to speed up 
the calculation, the ELASTIC ﬂag can be set to 1, i n which case the yield surface *MAT_198  *MAT_JOINTED_ROCK  
 will not be considered and only RO, GMOD, RNU, GMOD DP, GMODGR and 
the joint planes will be used. 
4.  This material type requires that the model is orie nted such that the z-axis is 
deﬁned in the upward direction.  The key parameters  are deﬁned such that 
may vary with depth (i.e. the z-axis) 
5.  The shape factor for a typical soil would be 0.8, but should not be pushed 
further than 0.75. 
6.  If STR_LIM is set to less than 0.005, the value is  reset to 0.005. 
7.  A correction has been introduced into the Drucker Prager model, such that the 
yield surface never infringes the Mohr-Coulomb crit erion.  This means that the 
model does not give the same results as a “pure” Dr ucker Prager model. 
8.  The load curves LCCPDR, LCCPT, LCCJDR, LCCJT allow  additional cohesion 
to be speciﬁed as a function of time.  The cohesion  is additional to that speci- 
ﬁed in the material parameters.  This is intended f or use during the initial stag- 
es of an analysis to allow application of gravity o r other loads without cracking 
or yielding, and for the cracking or yielding then to be introduced in a con- 
trolled manner.  This is done by specifying extra c ohesion that exceeds the 
expected stresses initially, then declining to zero .  If no curves are speciﬁed, no 
extra cohesion is applied. 
9.  The load curve for factor on strength applies simu ltaneously to the cohesion 
and tan (friction angle) of parent material and all  joints.  This feature is intend- 
ed for reducing the strength of the material gradua lly, to explore factors of 
safety.  If no curve is present, a constant factor of 1 is assumed.  Values much 
greater than 1.0 may cause problems with stability.  
10.  Extra variables for plotting.  By setting NEIPH on  *DATABASE_EXTENT_BI-
NARY to 15, the following variables can be plotted in D3PLOT and T/HIS: 
 Extra Variable 1: mobilized strength fraction for base material 
 Extra Variable 2: rk0 for base material 
 Extra Variable 3: rlamda for base material 
 Extra Variable 4:  crack opening strain for plane 1 
 Extra Variable 5: crack opening strain for plane 2  
 Extra Variable 6: crack opening strain for plane 3  
 Extra Variable 7: crack accumulated engineering sh ear strain for plane 1 
 Extra Variable 8: crack accumulated engineering sh ear strain for plane 2 
 Extra Variable 9: crack accumulated engineering sh ear strain for plane 3 
 Extra Variable 10: current shear utilization for p lane 1 
 Extra Variable 11: current shear utilization for p lane 2 
 Extra Variable 12: current shear utilization for p lane 3 *MAT_JOINTED_ROCK  *MAT_198  
  Extra Variable 13: maximum shear utilization to da te for plane 1 
 Extra Variable 14: maximum shear utilization to da te for plane 2 
 Extra Variable 15: maximum shear utilization to da te for plane 3 
11.  Joint planes would generally be deﬁned in the glob al axis system if they are 
taken from survey data.  However, the material mode l can also be used to rep- 
resent masonry, in which case the weak planes repre sent the cement and lie 
parallel to the local element axes. *MAT_199  *MAT_BARLAT_YLD2004

This is Material Type 199. This model was developed  by Aretz and Barlat [2004] and 
Barlat et al.  [2005].  It incorporates a yield cri terion called Barlat 2004-18p, where up to 
18 material parameters are used to deﬁne anisotropy  for a full 3D stress state.  This 
model is currently only available for solid element s.

in several directions, biaxial tests, and crystal p lasticity models (for out-of-plane

E Young’s modulus – a reasonable value must be provided even if 
LC_E is also input.  See Remark 2 . 
PR Poisson’s ratio 
SIGY Initial yield stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|zeroCst 
LC_E Optional load curve ID giving Young’s modulus as a function of 
temperature (overrides E and factors from EC3)

temperature (overrides PR) 
LC_AL Optional load curve ID giving alpha as a function o f temperature 
(over-rides thermal expansion data from EC3) 
TBL_SS Optional table ID containing stress- strain curves at diﬀerent 
temperatures (overrides curves from EC3) 
LC_FS Optio nal load curve ID giving failure strain as a functi on of 
temperature 
Remarks: 
1.  Eurocode 3 and Required Input.   By default, only E, PR and SIGY must be 
deﬁned.  The Young’s Modulus, |u1D438, will be scaled by a factor which is a func- 
tion of temperature as speciﬁed in EC3. The factor is 1.0 at low temperature.  
Eurocode 3 (EC3) Section 3.2 speciﬁes the stress-st rain behaviour of carbon 
steels at temperatures between 20°C and 1200°C. The  stress-strain curves given 
in EC3 are scaled within the material model such th at the maximum stress at 
low temperatures is SIGY (see Figure below).  By de fault, the thermal expan- 
sion coeﬃcient as a function of temperature will be  as speciﬁed in EC3 Section 
3.4.1.1.  
2.  Optional Input.   LC_E, LC_PR and LC_AL are optional; they should h ave 
temperature on the |u1D46J-axis and the material property on the |u1D466-axis, with the 
points in order of increasing temperature.  If deﬁn ed (that is, nonzero), they 
over-ride E, PR, and the relationships from EC3. Ho wever, a reasonable value 
for E should always be included, since these values  will be used for purposes 
such as contact stiﬀness calculation. *MAT_STEEL_EC3  *MAT_202  
 TBL_SS is also optional.  It overrides SIGY and the  stress-strain relationships 
from EC3. If present, TBL_SS must be the ID of a *D EFINE_TABLE.  The ﬁeld 
VALUE on the *DEFINE_TABLE should contain the tempe rature at which each 
stress-strain curve is applicable; the temperatures  should be in ascending or- 
der.  The curves that follow the temperature values  have plastic strain on the |u1D46J-
axis and yield stress on the |u1D466-axis as per other LS-DYNA elasto-plastic material 
models.  As with all instances of *DEFINE TABLE, th e curves containing the 
stress-strain data must immediately follow the *DEF INE_TABLE input data 
and must be in the correct order (that is, the same  order as the temperatures). 
3.  Temperature.  Temperature can be deﬁned by any of the *LOAD_THERM AL 
methods.  The temperature does not have to start at  zero: the initial tempera- 
ture will be taken as a reference temperature for e ach element, so non-zero 
initial temperatures will not cause thermal shock e ﬀects. 
4.  Extra History Variables.  Temperature is output by this material model as 
Extra History Variable 1. This can be useful for ch ecking the input in cases 
where temperature varies across the diﬀerent integr ation points, as is the case 
with *LOAD_THERMAL_VARIABLE_BEAM  Figure M202-1.   Stress-Strain Curves at various temperatures 0.02 0.00 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.10 0.12 0.14 0.20 0.18 0.160.00.20.40.60.81.01.2

Remarks: 
Reinforcement is treated as bars, acting independen tly in the local material |u1D46J and |u1D466 
directions.  By default, the local material |u1D46J-axis is the element |u1D46J-axis (parallel to the line 
from Node 1 to Node 2), but this may be overridden using AOPT or Element Beta 
angles.  
 
For shell elements, the reinforced concrete section  should be deﬁned using *PART_-
COMPOSITE with some integration points being reinfo rcement (referencing a Material 
ID using this material model) and others being conc rete (using for example *MAT_-
CONCRETE_EC2).  By default, shear strains in the lo cal |u1D46J|u1D466  and |u1D466 /u1D46̅ and /u1D46̅|u1D46J  directions are 
unresisted by this material model so it should not be used alone (without concrete).  
The area fractions of reinforcement in the local |u1D46J and |u1D466 directions at each integration 
point are given by the thickness fraction of the in tegration point in the *PART_COM-
POSITE deﬁnition times the fractions FRACX and FRAC Y on Card 2 above.  
 
For beam elements, *INTEGRATION_BEAM is used to deﬁ ne the material of which 
each integration point is made (e.g. reinforcement or concrete).  Due to a limitation of 
*INTEGRATION_BEAM, this material model can be paire d only with *MAT_CON-
CRETE_EC2 within the same *INTEGRATION_BEAM.     
 
The tensile response is elastic perfectly plastic, using yield stress SIGY. Optionally, load 
curves may be used to describe the stress-strain re sponse in tension (LCTEN) and 
compression (LCCOMP).  Either, neither or both curv es may be deﬁned.  If present, 
LCTEN overrides the perfectly-plastic tensile respo nse, and LCCOMP overrides the 
buckling curve.  The tensile and compressive plasti c strains are considered independent 
of each other. 
 
Bar buckling may be deﬁned either using the slender ness ratio LAMDA, or by setting 
the initial buckling strain EBU and down-slope DOWN SL. If neither are deﬁned, the 
bars simply yield in compression.  If both are deﬁn ed, the buckling behaviour deﬁned 
by EBU and DOWNSL overrides LAMDA.   
 
The slenderness ratio LAMDA determines buckling beh aviour and is deﬁned as, *MAT_203  *MAY_HYSTERETIC_REINFORCEMENT  
 /u1D458/u1D4:F 
|u1D4JF, 
Where, /u1D458 depends on end conditions, and 
/u1D4:F= unsupported length of reinforcement b ars 
|u1D4JF = radius of gyration which for round b ars is e q ual to ( b ar radius)/2. 
It is expected that users will determine LAMDA acco unting for the expected crack 
spacing. 
 
The alternative buckling behaviour deﬁned by EBU an d DOWNSL is shown below. 
 
 
Reloading after change of load direction follows a Bauschinger-type curve, leading to

Damage modelling: 
Two types of damage accumulation may be modelled.  Damage based on ductility 
(strain) can be modelled using the curves LCTEN and  LCCOMP – at high strain, these 
curves would show reducing stress with increasing s train.  
 
Damage based on hysteretic energy accumulation can be modelled using the 
parameters EPDAM1, EPDAM2 and DRESID. The damage is  a function of accumulated 
plastic strain: for this purpose, plastic strain in crements are always treated as positive in 
both tension and compression, and buckling strain a lso counts towards the 
accumulated plastic strain.  The material has its f ull stiﬀness and strength until the 
accumulated plastic strain reaches EPDAM1. Between plastic strains EPDAM1 and EP-
DAM2 the stiﬀness and strength fall linearly with a ccumulated plastic strain, reaching a 
factor DRESID at plastic strain EPDAM2. 
Dowel Action: 
The data on Card 3 deﬁnes the shear stiﬀness and st rength, and is optional.  Shear 
resistance is assumed to occur by dowel action.  Th e bars bend locally to the crack and 
crush the concrete.  An elastic-perfectly-plastic r elation is assumed for all shear 
components (in-plane and through-thickness).  The a ssumed (smeared) shear modulus 
and yield stress applicable to the reinforcement ba r cross-sectional area are as follows, 
based on formulae derived from experimental data by  El-Ariss, Soroushian, and 
Dulacska:

The input parameters should be given in model units , e.g. DBAR and LCHAR are in 
model length units, FCDOW is in model stress units.   These will be converted internally 
using UNITL and UNITC.  
Element erosion: 
By default, no erosion occurs.  Elements will be de leted only if EPDAM1 and EPDAM2 
are non-zero, and DRESID is zero, and the accumulat ed plastic strain reaches EPDAM2. 
If FRACX and FRACY are both non-zero, i.e. if there  is reinforcement in both local 
directions, then elements are eroded only when the condition above has been reached in 
both local directions. 
Output: 
The output stresses, as for all other LS-DYNA mater ial models, are by default in the 
global coordinate system.  They are scaled by the r einforcement fractions FRACX, FRA-
CY. The plastic strain output is the accumulated pl astic strain (increments always 
treated as positive), and is the greater such value  of the two local directions.  Extra 
history variables are available as follows: 
 
Extra variable 1:  Reinforcement stress in local |u1D46J direction (not scaled by FRACX) 
Extra variable 2:  Reinforcement stress in local |u1D466 direction (not scaled by FRACY) 
Extra variable 3:  Total strain in local |u1D46J direction

 *MAT_DISCRETE_BEAM_POINT_CONTACT  
This is  Material Type 205. It is used for discrete beam ele ments only (ELFORM = 6).  
It simulates contact forces between a point (Node 2 ) and an imaginary ﬂat surface 
(ﬁxed relative to Node 1).  The beam elements may h ave nonzero initial length.  On 
*SECTION_BEAM, SCOOR must be set to -13, the triad rotation option.  The triad 
rotation option ensures that the axis system remain s ﬁxed in the imaginary surface.

Remarks: 
1.  Model Description.  This material model simulates contact between a poi nt 
(Node 2 of the beam element) and an imaginary ﬂat s urface which is ﬁxed 
relative to Node 1. In these remarks we call the im aginary surface the “con- 
tact surface” – this does not  refer to *CONTACT. The local axes are deter- 
mined by CID on *SECTION_BEAM. The imaginary surfac e is in the local 
|u1D46J|u1D466 -plane passing through the initial coordinates of N ode 2. The local /u1D46̅-axis 
points outwards from the surface.  The surface tran slates and rotates with 
Node 1. SCOOR must be set to -13. The elements may have nonzero length. 
When Node 2 moves in the negative local /u1D46̅-direction relative to Node 1 
(penetration into the contact surface), the motion is resisted by stiﬀness 
STIFF and the force generated is described here as the contact force.  By 
default, uplift (Node 2 moving in the positive loca l /u1D46̅-direction relative to 
Node 1) is not resisted.  If uplift greater than DM XPZ occurs, either the el- 
ement is deleted (if LIMPZ = 0) or further uplift i s resisted by STIFF (if 
LIMPZ = 1).  
Sliding on the surface (motion of Node 2 in the loc al |u1D46J- and |u1D466-directions) is 
resisted by friction.  The maximum friction force i s given by FRIC times the 
contact force, with an upper limit of FRMAX if that  parameter is nonzero.  
When one of the displacement limits, DMXPX, DMXNX, DMXPY, or 
DMXNY, is reached, the default behavior is for Node  2 to fall oﬀ the edge of 
the contact surface, and the element is deleted (se e Figure M205-1 ). Option- 
ally, the input ﬁelds LIMPX, LIMNX, LIMPY, and LIMN Y can be used to 
change the behavior to “hard limits” using stiﬀness  STIFF – these represent *MAT_DISCRETE_BEAM_POINT_CONTACT  *MAT_205  
 contact with a hard surface perpendicular to the su rface on which Node 2 
slides.  In that case, the limit distances, DMXPX, DMXNX, DMXPY, and 
DMXNY, represent the initial gap between the point (Node 2) and the hard 
surface. 
Optionally, an initial bond strength can be deﬁned.   The bond forces are in 
addition to any contact and friction forces.  After  breakage of the bond, con- 
tact and sliding can continue to occur. 
If LCZ is deﬁned, compressive loading in the contac t direction follows LCZ 
while unload/reload is linear with stiﬀness STIFF. The value of STIFF must 
not be less than the maximum slope of any segment o f the curve LCZ.  
You can also deﬁne moment stiﬀnesses through KROTX,  KROTY and 
KROTZ. Optionally, these stiﬀnesses can be set to b ecome active at a certain 
time (TKROT).  If TKROT is nonzero, the moment stiﬀ ness will be zero be- 
fore that time and during any dynamic relaxation.  If TKROT is left zero, the 
moment stiﬀness will be active from the start of th e analysis including dur- 
ing dynamic relaxation.  
Damping is applied to the force normal to the surfa ce, to the bond forces, 
and to any forces generated by “hard limits” (LIMPX  etc.), but not to slid- 
ing.  Two damping methods are available: DAMP and D AMPZ/DAMPH. 
DAMP is recommended for general use where the exact  amount of damp- 
ing is unimportant, and the requirement is simply t o remove unwanted 
oscillations.  DAMPZ and DAMPH are available for ca ses where particular 
values of viscous damping coeﬃcient are required.  When LCZ is also de- 
ﬁned and the response is following the load curve ( meaning not during 
unloading/reloading), the damping coeﬃcient DAMPZ i s scaled to the ratio 
of the slope of LCZ to STIFF. The slope of LCZ is t he gradient at the current 
point on the load curve.

3.  Output.  Beam “axial” or “ /u1D44B” force is the force in the local |u1D46J-direction.  
“Shear-/u1D44C” or “ /u1D44C” force is the force in the local |u1D466-direction.  “Shear- |u1D44D” or “ |u1D44D” 
force is the force in the local /u1D46̅-direction, normal to the contact surface. 
Other output is written to the d3plot  and d3thdt  ﬁles in the places where

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
HOLSHR Flag for hole enlargement due to shear (see Remark 5 ): 
EQ.0: Hole does not enlarge due to shear deformation. 
NE.0: Shear deformation after bolt contacts the inner dia meter 
of the hole enlarges the hole.   
Remarks: 
1.  Bolted Joint Geometry.   The element represents a bolted joint. The nodes of 
the beam should be thought of as representing the p oints at the centers of the 
holes in the plates that are joined by the bolt.  W e recommend using 
SCOOR = -13 or +13 on *SECTION_BEAM. 
The axial direction is initially the line connectin g node 1 to node 2. The axial 
response is tensile only.  Instead of generating a compressive axial load, a gap 
is assumed to develop between the bolt head (or nut ) and the surface of the 
plate.  Contact between the bolted surfaces must be  modelled separately using 
*CONTACT. 
2.  Yield Force Curves.  Curves LCAX and LCSHR give yield force as a functi on 
of plastic displacement for the axial and shear dir ections, respectively.  The 
force increments are calculated from the elastic st iﬀnesses, subject to the yield 
force limits given by the curves. 
3.  Sliding Shear Displacement.   CLEAR allows the bolt to slide in shear, 
resisted by friction between bolt head/nut and the surfaces of the plates, from 
the initial position at the center of the hole.  CL EAR is the total sliding shear 
displacement before contact occurs between the bolt  shank and the inside sur- 
face of the hole.  Sliding shear displacement is no t included in the displace- 
ment used for LCSHR; LCSHR is intended to represent  the behavior after the 
bolt shank contacts the edge of the hole. 
4.  Shear Deformation and Axial Tension.   If KSHR and LCSHR represent 
deformation and rotation of the bolt itself, the de fault setting AXSHFL = 0 is 
recommended.  On the other hand, if KSHR and LCSHR represent deformation 
of the bearing surfaces, AXSHFL = 1 is recommended.   
The explanation is as follows.  Consider the case w here a shear displacement is 
applied to the bolted joint, while the plates are c onstrained to remain the same 
distance apart.  Mechanisms by which a bolted joint  can displace in the shear 
direction include: 
a)  the bolt sliding within a clearance gap;  *MAT_208  *MAT_BOLT_BEAM  
 b)  rotation, bending and shearing of the bolt itself;  and  
c)  deformation of the bearing surfaces while the bolt  itself remains almost 
rigid and perpendicular to the plates.  
The tension in the bolt might be expected to increa se when mechanism (b) oc- 
curs, because the length of the bolt itself has to increase (in this example, the 
plates are held the same distance apart); but tensi on would not increase in 
mechanisms (a) or (c).  In the LS-DYNA model, apply ing shear while holding 
the plates the same distance apart will cause the e lement to lengthen. When 
calculating the axial force in the bolt, *MAT_BOLT_ BEAM always ignores any 
lengthening due to mechanism (a) but is unable to d istinguish between (b) and 
(c) – KSHR and LCSHR could represent either or both  types of mechanism.  
AXSHFL is used to tell *MAT_BOLT_BEAM whether to tr eat these shear de- 
formations as contributing to changes of length of the bolt itself, and hence 
whether axial tension will be generated. 
5.  Hole Enlargement.   If HOLSHR is non-zero, shear deformation beyond t hat 
necessary to close the clearance gap enlarges the h ole in the plates and does not 
deform the bolt itself.  The force-deformation rela tion of this mechanism is still 
governed by LCSHR, and the deformation (that is, en largement of the hole) is 
tracked separately in each of the local - /u1D44C, + /u1D44C, -|u1D44D, and + |u1D44D directions.  Thus, for 
example, enlargement of the hole in the positive /u1D44C direction has no eﬀect on 
the position of the edge of the hole in the negativ e /u1D44C direction. 
6.  Output.  Beam “axial” or “X” force is the axial force in th e beam.  “shear-Y” and 
“shear-Z” are the shear forces.  Other output is wr itten to the d3plot  and 
d3thdt  ﬁles in the places where post-processors expect to  ﬁnd the stress and 
strain at the ﬁrst two integration points for integ rated beams.

This is Material Type 209.  It can be used only wit h resultant beam elements 
(ELFORM = 2).  It is intended for modelling buildin gs in seismic analysis and is similar 
to *MAT_191 but with increased capabilities.  Plast ic hinges can form at both ends of the 
element, and plasticity options are available for a xial and shear behavior as well as 
bending.  The yield surface incorporates moment-axi al interaction. Advanced features 
implemented for this material include hinge locatio ns and pinching eﬀect (Card 3), 
asymmetry and shear failure (Card 4), Bauschinger e ﬀect (Card 5), stiﬀness degradation 
(Cards 6 and 7), and FEMA ﬂags (Cards 8, 9, and 10) .

|u1D439|zeroCst Input parameter F0 on Card 3  (see Remark 3 )  
3.  Force Offset . The input parameter F0 oﬀsets the yield surface p arallel to the 
axial force axis.  It is the axial force at which t he maximum bending moment 
capacity occurs and is treated as tensile if F0 is positive, or compressive if F0 is 
negative.  The same axial force oﬀset F0 is used fo r both the local axes ( |u1D46≠ and |u1D461). 
For steel components, the value of F0 is usually ze ro.  For reinforced concrete 
components, F0 should be input as negative, corresp onding to the compressive 
axial force at which the moment capacities are maxi mum.

DELTAS, KAPPAS, DELTAT and KAPPAT that best ﬁts the  yield loci and the 
yield surface type ISURF.  
5.  Skew Yield Surface.  Reinforced concrete sections with asymmetric reinf orce- 
ment have a skew yield surface, meaning that the be nding moment capacities 
at zero axial force are diﬀerent in positive and ne gative bending, and the max- 
imum axial capacity occurs at a nonzero bending mom ent. Furthermore, the 
axial load at which maximum biaxial bending moment occurs depends on the 
angle of the bending axis. This can be modelled wit h ISURF = 3, where DEL- 
TAS and DELTAT control the slope of the line connec ting peak tensile and 
compressive strength vertices, and KAPPAS and KAPPA T control the slope of 
the line connecting peak moment vertices (which lie s in the balance plane). 
 
6.  Hardening Behavior during Cyclic Deformation (Hyste resis).  The input 
parameter IHARD determines how the force as a funct ion of deformation and 
moment as a function of rotation curves on Card 2  are applied during cyclic 
deformation.  In this case, “deformation” includes both axial deformation and 
rotation at plastic hinges. If IHARD = 1, the absci ssa represents cumulative 
absolute plastic deformation.  This quantity is alw ays positive. It increases 
whenever there is deformation in either direction.  Thus, during hysteresis, the 
yield moments are taken from points in the input cu rve with increasingly posi- 
tive deformation. If the curve shows a degrading be havior (reducing strength 
with deformation), then, once degraded by plastic d eformation, the yield force 
or moment can never recover to its initial value.  This option can be described F

 Figure M209-3.   Example of a skew yield surface *MAT_HYSTERETIC_BEAM  *MAT_209  
 as “fatigue-type” hysteretic behavior, where all pl astic cycles contribute to the 
degradation.  In the axial direction, plastic defor mation is accumulated sepa- 
rately for tensile and compressive deformations. 
If IHARD = 2, 3 or 4, the abscissa represents the p eak absolute value of the 
plastic deformation.  This quantity increases only when the absolute value of 
plastic deformation exceeds the previously recorded  maximum.  This option 
can be described as “high-tide” hardening behavior and follows the FEMA 
approach. In particular, IHARD of 3 and 4 reproduce  the yield-oriented and 
peak-oriented hysteresis, respectively, as shown be low. 
 
 
7.  Pinching.   Pinched-shape hysteresis loops are seen in experi ments on 
reinforced concrete members. They are caused by sti ﬀness changes due to 
cracks opening and closing.  This eﬀect on the ﬂexu re response may be simu- 
lated using input parameter PINM. The default, PINM  = 1.0, gives no pinch- 
ing.  The pinch points are given by moments and rot ations illustrated in the 
schematic below. Input parameter PINS has the same eﬀect on shear hysteresis IHARD = 2 IHARD = 3 IHARD = 4

 as PINM does on ﬂexure hysteresis.  See Figure M209-5 . 
8.  Kinematic Hardening. Kinematic hardening (Bauschinger eﬀect, whereby an 
increase in tensile yield strength occurs at the ex pense of compressive yield 
strength) is modelled by shift of the yield surface  and is controlled by input 
parameters HARDxx and GAMxx, where xx is MS, MT, AT , and AC for mo- 
ment about |u1D46≠-axis, moment about |u1D461-axis, axial tension and axial compression, 
respectively.  HARDxx is the rate at which the yiel d surface shifts, in units of 
force/displacement or force/strain for axial respon se (depending on the set- 
ting of IAX) and in units of moment/rotation for ﬂe xure response.  GAMxx is 
deﬁned such that HARDxx/GAMxx is the maximum force or moment by 
which the yield surface can shift.  
 
 
9.  Degradation, Damage and Element Erosion.  Stiﬀness and strength 
degradation are modelled using a damage approach. T he damaged fraction of 
the material does not contribute to the forces, the  moments or the stiﬀness. 
Damage is calculated in two stages: 
a)  a single damage parameter based on passing FEMA th resholds, and 
b)  component-speciﬁc damage (where “component” means axial tension, ax- 
ial compression, bending about s-axis and bending a bout t-axis). Ks

|u1D439|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.stactual = (1 − |u1D437|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst )(1 − |u1D437FEMA )|u1D439|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.st  nominal   . 
|u1D46J|u1D46J  can be AT for axial tension, AC for axial compress ion, MS for bending about 
the |u1D46≠-axis, MT for bending about the |u1D461-axis.  Here, |u1D439|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.stnominal  is the force or mo- 
ment calculated in the absence of damage for compon ent |u1D46J|u1D46J . |u1D437|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst  is the compo- 
nent-speciﬁc damage fraction for component xx , and |u1D437FEMA  is the damage 
calculated from passing FEMA thresholds (see Remark 11 ). 
The component-speciﬁc damage may be deﬁned to be de pendent on cumula- 
tive plastic deformation, on peak deformation, or a  combination of both:

 . 
Here |u1D714|oneCst|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst are |u1D714|twoCst|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst are the input parameters OMGxx1 and OMGxx2. ∆|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.stpea k  is 
the peak deformation (i.e., axial displacement, axi al strain or rotation depend- 
ing on xx  and IAX) that has occurred to date; ∆|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.staccum  is the accumulated plas- 
tic deformation; and ∆|u1D46JCst|u1D46JCst /co⋯⋯a.stult  is the input parameter DUAT, DUAC, RUMS or 
RUMT. |u1D7≠6|oneCst and |u1D7≠6|twoCst are the input parameters LAM1 and LAM2. Setting th ese to 
zero disables dependence on peak deformation and cu mulative plastic defor- 
mation, respectively. 
The damage |u1D437FEMA  is calculated using input parameters SOFT1 and SOF T2, 
taking the most damaged component including shear a s well as axial and mo- 
ment components.  For example, if SOFT1 = 3 and SOF T2 = 4, and the most 
damaged component has reached a FEMA index of 3.25 (meaning one quarter 
of the way from threshold 3 to threshold 4), then |u1D437FEMA = 0.25 . 
By default, no element erosion occurs.  If SOFT1 an d SOFT2 are non-zero, then 
an element is deleted if |u1D437FEMA  reaches zero.  
10.  Shear Behavior.  Nonlinear shear behavior is controlled using input 
parameters LCSHS, LCSHT, SFSHS and SFSHT. By defaul t, the shear yield 
surface is independent of the yield surface for axi al and ﬂexure and takes the 
following form: 
/u1D̅1:|u1D46≠Cst= |parenleftCv6|u1D449|u1D46≠Cst
|u1D449|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst |parenriµhtCv6|twoCst
+ |parenleftCv6|u1D449|u1D461Cst
|u1D449|u1D466Cst|u1D461Cst |parenriµhtCv6|twoCst
− 1  . 
Here, |u1D449|u1D46≠Cst and |u1D449|u1D461Cst are the current shear forces in the local |u1D46≠- and |u1D461-directions. |u1D449|u1D466Cst|u1D46≠Cst  
and |u1D449|u1D466Cst|u1D461Cst  are the current yield shear forces in the local |u1D46≠- and |u1D461-directions 
The shear yield forces are functions of plastic she ar strain (that is, shear angle). 
The plastic shear strain can be either peak or cumu lative, depending on *MAT_209  *MAT_HYSTERETIC_BEAM  
 IHARD. Optionally, the shear strengths can be user- deﬁned functions of the 
axial force; this is obtained by setting SFSHS and SFSHT to negative values. 
11.  FEMA Thresholds.  FEMA thresholds are used in performance-based 
earthquake engineering to classify the response acc ording to the level of de- 
formation.  The thresholds are the divisions betwee n regimes such as “Elastic”, 
“Immediate Occupancy”, “Life Safe”, etc. Output par ameters indicate the sta- 
tus of each element with respect to these regimes.  The thresholds are deﬁned 
by input parameters PRS n, PRT n, TS n, CS n, SS n, ST n where n = 1, 2, 3, and 4 
for the diﬀerent regimes.  PRS and PRT are plastic rotation about the |u1D46≠ and |u1D461 
axes, TS and CS are tensile and compressive strain or deformation according to 
the setting of IAX, and SS and ST are shear strains  in the |u1D46≠ and |u1D461 directions.  The 
corresponding output parameters, described as “FEMA  ﬂags” (see Remark 12 ) 
are “high-tide” values indicating which thresholds have been passed during 
the analysis, for example 3.25 means that the maxim um deformation that has 
occurred to date exceeds threshold 3 and is one qua rter of the way from 
threshold 3 to threshold 4. 
12.  Output.  In addition to the six resultants written for all beam elements, this 
material model writes a further 50 extra history va riables to the d3plot  and 
d3thdt  ﬁles, given in the table below. The data is writte n in the same position 
in these ﬁles as where integrated beams write the s tresses and strains at inte- 
gration points requested by BEAMIP on *DATABASE_EXT ENT_BINARY. 
Therefore, some post-processors may interpret this data as if the elements were 
integrated beams with 10 integration points, and in  that case the data may be 
accessed by selecting the appropriate integration p oint and data component:

This is  Material Type 211.  This material model was written  for Self-Piercing Rivets 
(SPR) connecting aluminum sheets. Each SPR should b e modelled by a single 
hexahedral (8-node solid) element, ﬁxed to the shee t either by direct meshing or by tied 
contact.  Pre- and post-processing methods are the same as for solid-element spotwelds 
using *MAT_SPOTWELD. On *SECTION_SOLID, set ELFORM  =  1.

Remarks: 
1.  SPR Geometry.  “Head” is the end of the SPR that fully perforates a sheet.  
“Tail” is the end that is embedded within the thick ness of a sheet.   
The sheet planes are deﬁned at the head by the quad rilateral deﬁned by nodes 
N1-N2-N3-N4 of the solid element; and at the tail b y the quadrilateral deﬁned 
by nodes N5-N6-N7-N8.  It is essential that the nod es N1 to N4 are ﬁxed to the 
head sheet (e.g. by direct meshing or tied contact) : the element has no stiﬀness 
to resist relative motion of nodes N1 to N4 in the plane of the head sheet.  Simi- 
larly, nodes N5 to N8 must be ﬁxed to the tail shee t 
The tail of the SPR is deﬁned as a point in the tai l sheet plane, initially at the 
center of the element face.  The head of the SPR is  initially at the center of the 
head sheet plane.  The SPR axis is deﬁned as the li ne joining the tail to the 
head.  Thus, the axis of the SPR would typically be  coincident with the solid 
element local /u1D46̅-axis if the solid is a cuboid.  It is the user’s r esponsibility to 
ensure that each solid element is oriented correctl y. 
During the analysis, the head and tail will always remain in the plane of the 
sheet but may move away from the centers of the she et planes if the shear forc- 
es in these planes are suﬃcient. 
2.  Young’s Modulus and Poisson’s Ratio.   E and PR are used only to calculate 
contact stiﬀness.  They are not used by the materia l model. 
3.  Axes.   Deformation is in length units and is on the |u1D46J-axis.  Force is on the |u1D466-
axis.  Rotation is in radians on the |u1D46J-axis.  Moment is on the |u1D466-axis. 
4.  Load Curve Assumptions.   All the load curves are expected to start at (0,0) . 
“Deformation” means the total deformation including  both elastic and plastic 
components, similarly for rotation. 
5.  “High Tide” Algorithm.   A “high tide” algorithm is used to determine the 
deformation or rotation to be used as the |u1D46J-axis of the load curves when look- 
ing up the current yield force or moment.  The “hig h tide” is the greatest dis- 
placement or rotation that has occurred so far duri ng the analysis. *MAT_211  *MAT_SPR_JLR  
 6.  Elastic Stiffness.   The ﬁrst two points of the load curve deﬁne the e lastic 
stiﬀness, which is used for unloading.  
7.  HELAS and TELAS.   If HELAS > 0, the remainder of the head load curv es after 
the ﬁrst two points is ignored and no softening or failure occurs.  The same 
applies for TELAS and the tail load curves. 
8.  Deformation and Rotation of the SPR.   Axial deformation is deﬁned as 
change of length of the line between the tail and h ead of the SPR. This line also 
deﬁnes the direction in which the axial force is ap plied. 
Shear deformation is deﬁned as motion of the tail a nd head points, in the sheet 
planes.  This deformation is not necessarily perpen dicular to axial deformation.  
Shear forces in these planes are controlled by the load curves LCSHT and LC-
SHH. 
Rotation at the tail is deﬁned as rotation of the t ail-to-head line relative to the 
normal of the tail sheet plane; and for the head, r elative to the normal of the 
head sheet plane. 
9.  Element Formulation.   Although ELFORM = 1 is used in the input data, 
*MAT_SPR_JLR is really a separate unique element fo rmulation.  The usual 
stress/force and hourglass calculations are bypasse d, and deformations and 
nodal forces are calculated by a method unique to * MAT_SPR_JLR; for exam- 
ple, a single *MAT_SPR_JLR element can carry bendin g loads.  
10.  Hourglass.   *HOURGLASS inputs are irrelevant to *MAT_SPR_JLR.  
11.  SWFORC ﬁle.   Output to the swforc  ﬁle works in the same way as for 
spotwelds.  Although inside the material model the load curves LCSHT and 
LCSHH control “shear” forces in the sheet planes, i n the swforc  ﬁle the quoted 
shear force is the force normal to the axis of the SPR.  
12.  Softening.   Before an element fails, it enters a “softening” regime in which the 
forces, moments and stiﬀnesses are ramped down as d isplacement increases 
(this avoids sudden shocks when the element is dele ted).  For example, for 
axial loading at the head, softening begins when th e maximum axial displace- 
ment exceeds DFAXH. As the displacement increases b eyond that point, the 
load curve will be ignored for that deformation com ponent.  The forces, mo- 
ments and stiﬀnesses are ramped down linearly with increasing displacement 
and reach zero at displacement = DFAX H × (1 + DMFAX H ) when the element 
is deleted.  The softening factor scales all the fo rce and moment components at 
both head and tail.  Thus, all the force and moment  components are reduced 
when any one displacement component enters the soft ening regime.  For ex- 
ample, if DFAXT = 3.0mm, and DMFAXT = 0.1, then sof tening begins when 
axial displacement of the tail reaches 3.0 mm and ﬁ nal failure occurs at 3.3 mm. *MAT_SPR_JLR  *MAT_211  
 13.  Initial Softening Displacements/Rotations.   If the inputs DFAXH, DFSHH, 
RFBMH, DFAXT, DFSHT, and RFBMT are non-zero, these values must be 
within the abscissa values of the relevant curve, s uch that the curve 
force/moment value is greater than zero at the deﬁn ed start of softening.   
If the inputs are left blank or zero, they will be calculated internally as follows: 
a)  Final failure will occur at the displacement or ro tation (DFAIL) at which 
the load curve reaches zero (determined, if necessa ry, by extrapolation 
from the last two points). 
b)  Displacement or rotation at which softening begins  is then back-
calculated.  For example, DFAXT = DFAIL (1 + DMGAXT) ⁄ . 
c)  If DMGAXT is left blank or zero, it defaults to 0. 1. 
d)  If the load curve does not drop to zero, and the ﬁ nal two points have a ze- 
ro or positive gradient, no failure or softening wi ll be caused by that dis- 
placement component. 
14.  Output Stress.   Output stresses (in the d3plot  and time-history output ﬁles) 
are set to zero.  
15.  Displacement Ratio.   The output variable “displacement ratio” (or rota tion 
ratio for bending), |u1D44J, is deﬁned as follows.  See also the Figure M211-1 . 
a)  |u1D44J = 0.0 to 1.0 .  The maximum force or moment on the input curve h as not 
yet been reached. |u1D44J is proportional to the maximum force or moment Displacement

bending)  *MAT_211  *MAT_SPR_JLR  
 reached so far, with 1.0 being the point of maximum  force or moment on 
the input curve.  
b)  |u1D44J  =  1.0 to 2.0 .  The element has passed the point of maximum forc e but 
has not yet entered the softening regime. |u1D44J rises linearly with displace- 
ment (or rotation) from 1.0 when maximum force occu rs to 2.0 when sof- 
tening begins.  
c)  |u1D44J  =  2.0 to 3.0 .  Softening is occurring. |u1D44J rises linearly with displacement 
from 2.0 at the onset of softening to 3.0 when the element is deleted. 
The displacement (or rotation) ratio is calculated separately for axial, shear and 
bending at the tail and head (see Remark 16  below).  The output listed by post-
processors as “plastic strain” is actually the maxi mum displacement or rotation 
ratio of any displacement or rotation component at head or tail.  This same 
variable is also output as “Failure” in the spotwel d data in the swforc  ﬁle (or 
the swforc section of the binout  ﬁle).

AOPT Material axes option (see MAT_ OPTION TROPIC_ELASTIC for a 
more complete description): 
EQ.0.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y 
element nodes.  For shells only, the material axes are 
then rotated about the normal vector to the surface  of 
the shell by the angle BETA. *MAT_213  *MAT_COMPOSITE_TABULATED_PLASTICITY_DAMAGE  
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
EQ.1.0:  Locally orthotropic with material axes determined b y a 
point, |u1D443, in space and the global location of the element 
center.  This option is for solid elements only. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by 
vectors deﬁned below 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by a 
vector /u1D42F and the normal vector to the plane of the ele- 
ment.  The plane of a solid element is the midsurfa ce 
between the inner surface and outer surface deﬁned by 
the ﬁrst four nodes and the last four nodes of the con- 
nectivity of the element, respectively.  Th us, for solid 
elements, AOPT = 3 is only available for hexahedrons. 
/u1D41A is determined by taking the cross product of /u1D42F with 
the normal vector, /u1D41B is determined by taking the cross 
product of the normal vector with /u1D41A, and /u1D41C is the nor- 
mal vector.  Then /u1D41A and /u1D41B are rotated about /u1D41C by an an- 
gle BETA. BE TA may be set in the keyword input for 
the element or in the input for this keyword.  Note  that 
for solids, the material axes may be switched depen d- 
ing on the choice of MACF. The switch may occur be-
fore or after applying BE TA depending on the value of 
MACF. 
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotropic in cylindrical coordinate syste m 
with the material axes determined by a vector, /u1D42F, and 
an originating point, |u1D443, deﬁning the centerline axis.  
This option is for solid elements only. 
LT.0.0: The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system I D 
number (CID on *DEFINE_COORDINATE_ NODES, 
*DEFINE_COORDINATE_SYSTEM or *DEFINE-_CO-
ORDINATE_VECTOR). 
MACF Material axes change ﬂag for solid elements: 
EQ.-4: Switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450 before BETA rotation 
EQ.-3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450 before BETA rotation 
EQ.-2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F before BETA rotation  
EQ.1: No change, default 
EQ.2: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F after BETA rotation 
EQ.3: Switch material axes |u1D44∆ and /u1D450 after BETA rotation *MAT_COMPOSITE_TABULATED_PLASTICITY_DAMAGE  *MAT_213  
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
EQ.4:  Switch material axes |u1D44F and /u1D450 after BETA rotation 
Figure M2-2  indicates when LS-DY NA applies MACF during the 
process to obtain the ﬁnal material axes.  If BETA on *ELE-
MENT_SOLID_ {OPTION} is deﬁned, then that BE TA is used for 
the rotation for all AOPT options.  Otherwise, if A OPT = 3, the 
BETA input on Card 3 rotates the axes.  For all other values of 
AOPT, the material axes will be switched as speciﬁe d by MACF, 
but no BETA rotation will be performed. 
FILT Factor for strain rate ﬁltering (optional):  
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCsta v g = (1 − FILT) × |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCstcur + FILT × |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Csta v g  
where |u1D4J6 is the previous time step.  The value of FILT is between 0 
and 1

TCSYM Flag for handling tension- compression asymmetry in all three 
material directions: 
EQ.0:  Do not adjust user-deﬁned data. 
EQ.1: Compute and use average of tension and compression 
elastic moduli in adjusting the stress- strain curve.  See 
Remark 7 . 
EQ.2: Use compression modulus as user- deﬁned tension 
modulus in adjusting the stress-strain curve.  See Remark 
7. 
EQ.3: Use tension modulus as user- deﬁned compression 
modulus in adjusting the stress-strain curve.  See Remark 
7. 
EQ.4: Use user- deﬁned tensile curve as the compressive curve 
overriding the user- deﬁned compressive curve.  This 
implies that the normal stress-strain curves are sy mmet- 
ric including yield values. 
EQ.5: Use user- deﬁned compressive curve as the tensile curve 
overriding the user- deﬁned tensile curve.  This implies 
that the normal stress-strain curves are symmetric in- 
cluding yield values.

Remarks: 
1.  Flow Rule Coefﬁcients.   Flow rule coeﬃcients (FRC) are determined using 
the plastic Poisson’s ratios [ 1, 2, 3]. Details on how to compute FRCs can be 
found in [ 8]. 
2.  Temperature-Strain Rate Test Result Tables.   A minimum of two sets of 
(strain rate-temperature) curves are needed.  If th e material is not temperature 
and rate sensitive, make the two sets of table data  identical.  If the material is 
rate and temperature sensitive, the curve correspon ding to the smallest total 
strain rate for the given reference temperature (TE MP in Card 10) is assumed 
to be the quasi-static, room temperature (QS-RT) cu rve and inﬂuences the vis- 
coelastic-plastic computations. 
An example TABLE_3D (LT i) structure for 3 total strain rates and 3 tempera-
tures for tension in the |u1D44∆-direction test is shown below.  The total strain r ates *MAT_213  *MAT_COMPOSITE_TABULATED_PLASTICITY_DAMAGE  
 are converted within LS-DYNA into eﬀective plastic strain rate (EPSR) for each 
of the input stress-strain curves.  The EPSR value assigned for each stress-
strain curve is used for yield stress interpolation .

Restrictions/assumptions about the input data are a s follows: 
a)  For normal (tension and compression) and shear cur ve data: Use positive 
stress and positive strain values in the curve data . 
b)  For oﬀ-axis curve data: Use positive stress and po sitive strain values in the 
curve data if the oﬀ-axis test is a tension test.  Use negative stress and pos- 
itive strain values in the curve data if the oﬀ-axi s test is a compressive test.  
The same combination of tension-compression tests i s assumed for all 
*MAT_213 cards used in a speciﬁc model.  For instan ce, if the LT10-LT11-
LT12 combination is tension-compression-compression  for one set 
*MAT_213 data, then it is assumed that all other *M AT_213 data in the 
model use tension-compression-compression data. 
c)  All shear strain values are tensorial, not enginee ring (total strain rate input 
must be tensorial for shear component).  
d)  For an elastic component, meaning |u1D44∆-direction in a unidirectional compo- 
site, set the initial yield strain value (in YSC) g reater than the failure strain 
(last strain value in the curve). *MAT_COMPOSITE_TABULATED_PLASTICITY_DAMAGE  *MAT_213  
 3.  YSC.  Curve of initial yield strain values (YSC) must lis t curves in ascending 
order as abscissa values with the corresponding yie ld strains given as the ordi- 
nate values.  An example YSC data is shown below fo r a case with two sets of

 5.  Failure Criterion.   Use Cards 8 n.1 and 8 n.2 for the failure criterion to be included 
in the failure model.  The failure criterion and as sociated values are given as (see 
[5] for details) 
a)  Puck Failure Criterion (PFC).  For this criterion, FTYPE = 1 and FV0, …, 
FV14 are the magnitudes of fracture energy, damage,  magniﬁcation factor, 
slope parameters, and material parameters for the ﬁ ber. 
b)  Tsai-Wu Failure Criterion (TWFC) .  For this criterion, FTYPE = 2 and FV1, 
..., FV12 are the magnitudes of the failure stresse s |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst |u1D447Cst , |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44∆Cst /u1D4:6.st, |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst |u1D447Cst, |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44FCst|u1D44FCst /u1D4:6.st, |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst |u1D447Cst, 
|u1D7≠∆̂|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J≠Cst /u1D4:6.st, |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst , |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst , |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J≠Cst ,  |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst |fourCst|fiveCst , |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst |fourCst|fiveCst , and |u1D7≠∆̂|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J≠Cst |fourCst|fiveCst .  
c)  Generalized Tabulated Failure Criterion (GTFC) . For solid elements with 
FTYPE = 3, FV1 is |u1D4JB, the in-plane and out-of-plane interaction term.  FV2 
and FV3 are the Table IDs of the two tables for the  in-plane and the out-of-
plane (/u1D̅0:, |u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J9Cst ) values that deﬁne the in-plane and out-of-plane fa ilure sur- 
faces, respectively.  For the in-plane failure surf ace, the table contains the 
|u1D44∆-direction stress (S11) value-curve ID pairs.  For the out-of-plane failure 
surface, the table contains the normal /u1D450-direction stress (S33) value-curve 
ID pairs.  For shell elements, only FV2 is used wit h the preceding deﬁni- 
tion and the element fails when the damage is 1. Th ere is no data in card 
8d.2. 
A partial example is shown below for solid elements .

mal /u1D450-direction stress (S33) data.. 
6.  Element Erosion.   Element is eroded if failure occurs at any one Ga uss point.  
Note that *DEFINE_ELEMENT_EROSION_SHELL is required  for shell ele- 
ment erosion; the number of integration points need ed to fail to erode the ele- 
ment is deﬁned there. 
7.  Adjusting Stress-Strain Curves.   The user-deﬁned stress-strain curves are 
adjusted when using TCSYM = 1, 2, and 3 as follows.   If |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst|zeroCsts  and |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st|zeroCsts represent 
the original |u1D44∆-direction (1-direction) elastic tensile and compre ssive moduli 
respectively, then the modiﬁed elastic moduli are c omputed as 
a)  TCSYM = 1.   |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst=  |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st= 0.5 |parenleftCv3|u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst|zeroCsts+ |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st|zeroCsts|parenriµhtCv3   
b)  TCSYM = 2.   |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst= |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst|zeroCsts and |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st= |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst|zeroCsts 
c)  TCSYM = 3.  |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst= |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st|zeroCsts and |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st= |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st|zeroCsts.  
Let |u1D44J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst= |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst|u1D438|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst|zeroCsts/fraction.v1  and |u1D44J|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st= |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st|u1D438|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st|zeroCsts/fraction.v1 .  The adjusted tensile strain is then com- 
puted as the original tensile strain divided by |u1D44J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst, the adjusted compressive 
strain is computed as the original compressive stra in divided by |u1D44J|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st, the ad- 
justed tensile yield strain is computed as the orig inal tensile yield strain divid- 
ed by |u1D44J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D447Cst, and the adjusted compressive yield strain is comp uted as the original 
compressive yield strain divided by |u1D44J|u1D44∆Cst/u1D4:6.st.  The same process is then applied to 
the other two normal directions. 
8.  Curve Discretization.  For this material, only LCINT on *CONTROL_SOLU-
TION (not with *DEFINE_CURVE) can be used to specif y the number of dis- 
cretized points for the input curves.  The default value is 100. *MAT_COMPOSITE_TABULATED_PLASTICITY_DAMAGE  *MAT_213  
 9.  Poisson’s Ratios.   If necessary, the input Poisson’s ratios are adju sted 
internally in LS-DYNA to satisfy the criteria descr ibed in [ 6]. 
10.  Plastic Multiplier. The plastic multiplier computations involve ﬁnding the root 
of the yield function.  The root is computed numeri cally, not analytically.  The 
ﬁrst step is to ﬁnd the interval bounding the root.   The value of N set in ﬁeld 
PMACC on Card 10 controls the discretization of the  interval to ﬁnd the 
bound.  The larger the value of N, the more accurat e the bound.  However, the 
computational time is likely to increase with large r values of N. 
11.  Stochastic Variation.   A stochastic variation can be added using keyword  
*DEFINE_STOCHASTIC_VARIATION_PROPERTIES. There are six quantities 
(see table below) which can be varied, so Card 2 in  *DEFINE_STOCHASTIC_-
VARIATION_PROPERTIES must be deﬁned six times and a ssumes that the 
quantities being varied are in the order speciﬁed.

12.  Damage Formulation.  By default, the damage calculations are carried ou t 
using eﬀective stress as the internal state variabl e for tracking growth of dam- 
age parameters |u1D4J1|u1D4J≠Cst /u1D451.st |u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst . An alternate formulation is available where the d amage 
parameters are taken as functions of directional pl astic strains to track damage 
growth.  Details of both the formulations are avail able in [ 10 ]. 
External Files Generated by MAT_213:

Each of these ﬁles contains LCINT stress-eﬀective p lastic strain curve data points.  We 
urge you to use these plot ﬁles to check if the str ess-eﬀective plastic strain curves for 
each of the 12 components intersect or not when rat e and temperature sensitive data are 
input.  Intersecting curves or intersecting extrapo lated curves for a component are likely 
to lead to inconsistent results.  An example of the  set of ﬁles generated is shown below.

 *MAT_DRY_FABRIC  
This is  Material Type 214. This material model can be used to model high strength 
woven fabrics, such as Kevlar ® 49, with transverse orthotropic behavior for use i n 
structural systems where high energy absorption is required (Bansal et al., Naik et al., 
Stahlecker et al.).  The major applications of the model are for the materials used in 
propulsion engine containment system, body armor an d personal protections. 
Woven dry fabrics are described in terms of two pri ncipal material directions, 
longitudinal warp and transverse ﬁll yarns.  The pr imary failure mode in these 
materials is the breaking of either transverse or l ongitudinal yarn.  An equivalent 
continuum formulation is used and an element is des ignated as having failed when it 
reaches some critical value for strain in either di rections.  A linearized approximation to 
a typical stress-strain curve is shown in Figure M214-1  and to a typical engineering 
shear stress-strain curve is shown in the ﬁgure cor responding to the GAB i ﬁeld in the 
variable list.  Note that the principal directions are labeled |u1D44∆ for the warp and |u1D44F for the 
ﬁll, and the direction /u1D450 is orthogonal to |u1D44∆ and |u1D44F. 
The material model is available for membrane elemen ts and it is recommended to use a 
double precision version of LS-DYNA.

|u1D7≠≠|u1D44FCst/co⋯⋯a.stfail  
Remarks: 
1.  Strain Rate Effects.   Strain rate eﬀects are accounted for using a Cowp er-
Symonds model which scales the stress according to the strain rate: 
/u1D6D4ad j=/u1D6D4|parenleftCvJ1 +|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D443Cst  . 
In the above equation /u1D6D4 is the quasi-static stress, /u1D6D4ad j is the adjusted stress ac- 
counting for strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇, and |u1D436 (CCE) and |u1D443 (PCE) are the Cowper-Symonds 
factors which must be determined experimentally for  each material. 
The model captures the non-linear strain rate eﬀect s in many materials.  With 
its less than unity exponent, 1/|u1D4JD, this model captures the rapid increase in ma- 
terial properties at low strain rate, while increas ing less rapidly at very high 
strain rates.  Because stress is a function of stra in rate the elastic stiﬀness also 
is: 
/u1D404ad j=/u1D404|parenleftCvJ1 +|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D443Cst 
where /u1D404ad j is the adjusted elastic stiﬀness.  Additionally, t he strains to peak and 
strains to failure are assumed to follow a Cowper-S ymonds model with, possi- 
bly diﬀerent , constants 
|u1D7≠≠ad j=ε|parenleftCvJ1 +|u1D7≠≠̇
|u1D436|u1D46≠Cst|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D443Cst/u1D460.sts  , 
where, |u1D7≠≠ad j is the adjusted eﬀective strain to peak stress or strain to failure, and 
|u1D436|u1D46≠Cst and |u1D443|u1D46≠Cst are CSE and PSE respectively. 
2.  Stress-Strain beyond Peak Stress.   When strained beyond the peak stress, 
the stress decreases linearly until it attains a va lue equal to SIGPOST, at which 
point the stress-strain relation becomes nonlinear.   In the non-linear region the 
stress is given by 
|u1D7≠∆ =  |u1D7≠∆post 
⎣⎢⎡1 − |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠ − |u1D7≠≠[|u1D44∆Cst/|u1D44FCst],post 
|u1D7≠≠[|u1D44∆Cst/|u1D44FCst],fail − |u1D7≠≠[|u1D44∆Cst/|u1D44FCst],post |parenriµhtCv6/u1D451.stfac 
⎦⎥⎤  ,  *MAT_214  *MAT_DRY_FABRIC  
 where |u1D7≠∆post  and |u1D7≠≠post  are, respectively, the stress and strain demarcati ng the 
onset of nonlinear behavior.  The value of SIGPOST is the same in both the 
transverse and longitudinal directions, whereas |u1D7≠≠a,post  and |u1D7≠≠b ,post  depend on 
direction and are derived internally from EASF, EBS F, and SIGPOST.  The fail- 
ure strain, |u1D7≠≠[|u1D44∆Cst/|u1D44FCst],fail , speciﬁes the onset of failure and diﬀers in the l ongitudinal 
and transverse directions.  Lastly the exponent, |u1D4J1fac , determines the shape of 
nonlinear stress-strain curve between |u1D7≠≠post  and |u1D7≠≠[|u1D44∆Cst |u1D44FCst ⁄ ]/co⋯⋯a.stfail .

b)  |u1D7≠≠|u1D44∆Cst>  |u1D7≠≠max  and |u1D7≠≠|u1D44FCst>  |u1D7≠≠max .*MAT_4A_MICROMEC  *MAT_215  
 *MAT_4A_ MICROMEC  
This is  Material Type 215. A micromechanical material that distinguishes between a 
ﬁber/inclusion and a matrix material, developed by 4a engineering GmbH. It is 
available for the explicit code for shell, thick sh ell, and solid elements. Useful hints and 
an input example can be found in [ 1]. More theory and application notes are provided 
in [ 2].  
 
This material is intended for anisotropic composite  materials, especially for short 
(SFRT) and long ﬁber thermoplastics (LFRT). The mat rix behavior is modeled with an 
isotropic elasto-viscoplastic von Mises model.  The  ﬁber/inclusion behavior is 
transverse isotropic elastic.  This material model can be used for classical endless ﬁber 
composites. 
 
The inelastic homogenization for describing the com posite deformation behavior is 
based on: 
• Mori Tanaka Meanﬁeld Theory [ 3,4] 
• ellipsoidal inclusions using Eshelby’s solution [ 5,6] 
• orientation averaging [ 7] 
• a linear ﬁtted closure approximation to determine  the 4 th  order ﬁber orientation 
tensor out of the user provided 2 nd  order ﬁber orientation tensor. 
 
The software product 4a micromec can calculate and export the thermo-elastic 
composite properties [ 8]. 
 
Failure/damage of the composite can be considered w ith: 
• a ductile damage initiation and evolution model f or the matrix (DIEM) 
• ﬁber failure with a maximum stress criterion 
References [ 9] and [ 10 ] provide more details on the material characteriza tion. 
The (ﬁber) orientation can be deﬁned either for the  whole material using Cards 2 and 3 
or elementwise using *ELEMENT_(T)SHELL_BETA or *ELEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO. 
The manufacturing process highly inﬂuences the mech anical properties of SFRT and 
LFRT in injection molded parts.  By mapping the ﬁbe r orientation from the process 
simulation to the structural analysis the local ani sotropy can be considered [ 11 ,12 ]. The 
ﬁber orientation, length and volume fraction can th erefore as well be deﬁned for each 
integration point by using *INITIAL_STRESS_(T)SHELL (SOLID) [ 2]. Details on the 
history variables that can be initialized (extra hi story variables 9-18) can be found in the 
output section. *MAT_215  *MAT_4A_MICROMEC

the element or in the input for this keyword.  Note  that 
for solids, the material axes may be switched depen d-

the rotation for all AOPT options.  Otherwise, if A OPT = 3, the 
BETA input on Card 3 rotates the axes.  For all other values of 
AOPT, the material axes will be switched as speciﬁe d by MACF, 
but no BETA rotation will be performed.

eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues.  The co ordinate system based on the 
eigenvectors is the material coordinate system.  Th e values /u1D45E|oneCst|oneCst ,…, /u1D45E|threeCst|threeCst  for solids (history 
variables 11 through 16) and the values cos (|u1D6F+ ) and - sin |u1D6F+  for shells (history variables 11

system. The values |u1D44∆|oneCst and |u1D44∆|twoCst (A11 and A22 of history variables 9 and 10) shown in the 
ﬁgure represent the eigenvalues, or in other words,  the lengths of the ellipsoid.  Thus.  
history variables 9 and 10 give the shape of the el lipsoid while history variables 11

Phases: 
The material properties for each element are initia lized using the data for the ﬁrst 
phase.  After the center of the element passes thro ugh the transition plane deﬁned by 
the two points, the material properties are irrever sibly changed to the second phase. 
 
The plane is deﬁned by two points.  The ﬁrst point,  coordinates X1, Y1, and Z1, lies on 
the plane.  The second point, coordinates X2, Y2, a nd Z2, deﬁnes the exterior normal as 
a unit vector in the direction from the ﬁrst point to the second point. 
Remarks: 
This hypoelastic material model may not be stable f or ﬁnite (large) strains.   If large 
strains are expected, a hyperelastic material model , such as *MAT_002 or *MAT_217, 
would be more appropriate. *MAT_OPTIONTROPIC_ELASTIC_PHASE_CHANGE  *MAT_217

This is  Material Type 217 a generalization of Material Type  2 for which material 
properties change on an element-by-element basis up on crossing a plane in space. 
 
This material is valid only  for shells.  The stress update is incremental and the elastic 
constants are formulated in terms of Cauchy stress and true strain.

The frequency independent damping is obtained by ha ving a spring and slider in series 
as shown in the following sketch:  
 
This option applies only to orthotropic solid eleme nts and aﬀects only the deviatoric 
stresses. 
 
The procedure for describing the principle material  directions is explained for solid and 
shell elements for this material model and other an isotropic materials.  We will call the 
material direction the {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} coordinate system.  The AOPT options illustrated i n 
Figure M2-1  can deﬁne the {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} system for all elements of the parts that use the 
material, but this is not the ﬁnal material directi on.  There {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} system deﬁned by the 
AOPT options may be oﬀset by a ﬁnal rotation about the /u1D41C-axis.  The oﬀset angle we call 
BETA. 
 
For solid elements, the BETA angle is speciﬁed in o ne of two ways.  When using 
AOPT = 3, the BETA parameter deﬁnes the oﬀset angle  for all elements that use the 
material.  The BETA parameter has no meaning for th e other AOPT options.  G
σfriction*MAT_OPTIONTROPIC_ELASTIC_PHASE_CHANGE  *MAT_217  
 Alternatively, a BETA angle can be deﬁned for indiv idual solid elements as described in 
remark 5 for *ELEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO.  The beta angle by the ORTHO option is 
available for all values of AOPT, and it overrides the BETA angle on the *MAT card for 
AOPT = 3. 
 
The directions determined by the material AOPT opti ons may be overridden for 
individual elements as described in remark 3 for *E LEMENT_SOLID_ORTHO.  
However, be aware that for materials with AOPT = 3,  the ﬁnal {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} system will be 
the system deﬁned on the element card rotated about  /u1D41C-axis by the BETA angle speciﬁed 
on the *MAT card. 
 
There are two fundamental diﬀerences between shell and solid element orthotropic 
materials.  First, the /u1D41C-direction is always normal to a shell element such  that the /u1D41A-
direction and /u1D41B-directions are within the plane of the element.  S econd, for some 
anisotropic materials, shell elements may have uniq ue ﬁber directions within each layer 
through the thickness of the element so that a laye red composite can be modeled with a 
single element. 
 
When AOPT = 0 is used in two-dimensional planar and  axisymmetric analysis, it is 
critical that the nodes in the element deﬁnition be  numbered counterclockwise for this 
option to work correctly. 
 
Because shell elements have their /u1D41C-axes deﬁned by the element normal, AOPT = 1 and 
AOPT = 4 are not available for shells.  Also, AOPT = 2 requires only the vector /u1D41A be 
deﬁned since /u1D41D is not used.  The shell procedure projects the inp utted /u1D41A-direction onto 
each element surface. 
 
Similar to solid elements, the {/u1D41A,/u1D41B,/u1D41C} coordinate system determined by AOPT is then 
modiﬁed by a rotation about the /u1D41C-axis which we will call /u1D̅1∫.  For those materials that 
allow a unique rotation angle for each integration point through the element thickness, 
the rotation angle is calculated by 
/u1D̅1∫|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D6FD + |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst 
where |u1D6FD is a rotation for the element, and |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst is the rotation for the i’th layer of the 
element.  The |u1D6FD angle can be input using the BETA parameter on the  *MAT data, or will 
be overridden for individual elements if the BETA k eyword option for *ELEMENT_-
SHELL is used.  The |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst angles are input using the ICOMP = 1 option of *SE CTION_-
SHELL or with *PART_COMPOSITE.  If |u1D6FD or |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst is omitted, they are assumed to be zero. 
 
All anisotropic shell materials have the BETA optio n on the *MAT card available for 
both AOPT = 0 and AOPT = 3, except for materials 91  and 92 which have it available for 
all values of AOPT, 0, 2, and 3. 
 
All anisotropic shell materials allow an angle for each integration point through the 
thickness, |u1D6FD|u1D4J6Cst, except for materials 2, 86, 91, 92, 117, 130, 170,  172, and 194.   *MAT_217  *MAT_OPTIONTROPIC_ELASTIC_PHASE_CHANGE  
  
This discussion of material direction angles in she ll elements also applies to thick shell 
elements which allow modeling of layered composites  using *INTEGRATION_SHELL 
or *PART_COMPOSITE_TSHELL. *MAT_MOONEY-RIVLIN_PHASE_CHANGE  *MAT_218

 Phases: 
The material properties for each element are initia lized using the data for the ﬁrst 
phase.  After the center of the element passes thro ugh the transition plane deﬁned by 
the two points, the material properties are irrever sibly changed to the second phase. 
 
The plane is deﬁned by two points.  The ﬁrst point,  deﬁned by the coordinates X1, Y1, 
and Z1, lies on the plane.  The second point, deﬁne d by the coordinates X2, Y2, and Z2, 
deﬁne the exterior normal as a unit vector in the d irection from the ﬁrst point to the 
second point. 
Material Formulation: 
The strain energy density function is deﬁned as: 
/u1D44A= |u1D434(/u1D4:C− 3) + |u1D43J(/u1D4:C/u1D4:C− 3) + |u1D436|parenleftCv2/u1D4:C/u1D4:C/u1D4:C−|twoCst− 1|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D437(/u1D4:C/u1D4:C/u1D4:C− 1)|twoCst 
where 
|u1D436 =  0.5 |u1D434 +  |u1D43J 
|u1D437 =|u1D434(5|u1D71≠ − 2) + |u1D43J(11|u1D71≠ − 5)

/u1D̅08 =  Poisson ’s ratio

/u1D4:C,/u1D4:C/u1D4:C,/u1D4:C/u1D4:C/u1D4:C=  in v ariants of right Cauchy-Green Tensor C. 
The load curve deﬁnition that provides the uniaxial  data should give the change in 
gauge length, ∆/u1D4:F, versus the corresponding force.  In compression b oth the force and 
the change in gauge length must be speciﬁed as nega tive values.  In tension the force 
and change in gauge length should be input as posit ive values.  The principal stretch 
ratio in the uniaxial direction, |u1D7≠6|oneCst, is then given by 
|u1D7≠6|oneCst=/u1D4:F|zeroCst+ ∆/u1D4:F
/u1D4:F|zeroCst 
with /u1D4:F|zeroCst being the initial length and /u1D4:F being the actual length. 
 *MAT_MOONEY-RIVLIN_PHASE_CHANGE  *MAT_218  
 Alternatively, the stress versus strain curve can a lso be input by setting the gauge 
length, thickness, and width to unity (1.0) and deﬁ ning the engineering strain in place 
of the change in gauge length and the nominal (engi neering) stress in place of the force, 
see Figure M218-1 . 
 
The least square ﬁt to the experimental data is per formed during the initialization phase 
and is a comparison between the ﬁt and the actual i nput is provided in the d3hsp  ﬁle.  It 
is a good idea to visually check to make sure it is  acceptable.  The coeﬃcients |u1D434 and |u1D43J 
are also printed in the output ﬁle.  It is also adv ised to use the material driver (see 
Appendix K) for checking out the material model. changeingaugelength

Figure M218-2  The stress versus strain curve can used instead of the  force 
versus the change in the gauge length by setting the gauge length, thickness,

change in gauge length and the nominal (engineering) st ress in place of the 
force.  *MAT_077_ O is a better alternative for ﬁtting data resembling the  curve

RESIDS Residual strength for layer damage 
Model Description: 
CODAM2 is developed for modeling the nonlinear, pro gressive damage behavior of 
laminated ﬁber-reinforced plastic materials.  The m odel is based on the work by 
(Forghani, 2011; Forghani et al.  2011a; Forghani e t al.  2011b) and is an extension of the 
original model, CODAM (Williams et al.  2003). 
 
Brieﬂy, the model uses a continuum damage mechanics  approach and the following 
assumptions have been made in its development: 
1.  The material is an orthotropic medium consisting o f a number of repeating 
units through the thickness of the laminate, called  sub-laminates.  For example, 
[0/±45/90] is in a [0/±45/90] 8S  laminate. 
2.  The nonlinear behavior of the composite sub-lamina te is only caused by 
damage evolution.  Nonlinear elastic or plastic def ormations are not consid- 
ered. *MAT_CODAM2  *MAT_219  
 Formulation: 
The in-plane secant stiﬀness of the damaged laminat e is represented as the summation 
of the eﬀective contributions of the layers in the laminate as shown. 
/u1D400/u1D451.st= |summationCv1 |u1D461|u1D4J8Cst/u1D6BB|u1D4J8Cst/ε.st/u1D410|u1D4J8Cst/u1D451.st/u1D6BB|u1D4J8Cst 
where /u1D6BB|u1D4J8Cst is the transformation matrix for the strain vector , and /u1D410|u1D4J8Cst/u1D451.st is the in-plane secant 
stiﬀness of kth  layer in the principal orthotropic plane, and |u1D461|u1D4J8Cst is the thickness of the kth  
layer of an |u1D4JB-layered laminate. 
 
A physically-based and yet simple approach has been  employed here to derive the 
damaged stiﬀness matrix.  Two reduction coeﬃcients,  |u1D44J/u1D45:.st  and |u1D44J|u1D4JACst, that represent the 
reduction of stiﬀness in the longitudinal (ﬁber) an d transverse (matrix) directions have 
been employed.  The shear modulus has also been red uced by the matrix reduction 
parameter.  The major and minor Poisson’s ratios ha ve been reduced by |u1D44J/u1D45:.stand  |u1D44J|u1D4JACstre- 
spectively.  A sub-laminate-level reduction, |u1D44J|u1D43FCst, is incorporated to avoid spurious stress 
locking in the damaged zone.  This would lead to an  eﬀective reduced stiﬀness matrix 
/u1D410|u1D4J8Cst/u1D451.st. The reduction coeﬃcients are equal to 1 in the und amaged condition and gradually 
decrease to 0 for a saturated damage condition.

Damage Evolution: 
In CODAM2, the evolution of damage mechanisms is ex pressed in terms of equivalent 
strain parameters.  The equivalent strain function that governs the ﬁber stiﬀness 
reduction parameter is written in terms of the long itudinal normal strains by 
|u1D7≠≠/u1D45:.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J8Cste q = |u1D7≠≠|oneCst|oneCst /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J8Cst,/u1D458= 1, . . . , |u1D4JB 
The equivalent strain function that governs the mat rix stiﬀness reduction parameter is 
written in an interactive form in terms of the tran sverse and shear components of the 
local strain: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JACst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J8Cste q = sign|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|twoCst /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J8Cst|parenriµhtCv1/radical.v5|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|twoCst /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J8Cst|parenriµhtCv1|twoCst+ |parenleftCv4|u1D6F∆|oneCst|twoCst /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J8Cst
2|parenriµhtCv4|twoCst
,/u1D458= 1, . . . , |u1D4JB *MAT_219  *MAT_CODAM2  
 The sign of the transverse normal strain plays a ve ry important role in the initiation and 
growth of damage since it indicates the compressive  or tensile nature of the transverse 
stress.  Therefore, the equivalent strain for the m atrix damage carries the sign of the 
transverse normal strain. 
 
Evolution of the overall damage mechanism (anti-loc king) is written in terms of the 
maximum principal strains: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D43FCste q = max|<racketleftCv1prn(ε)|<racketriµhtCv1  . 
Within the framework of non-local strain-softening formulations adopted here, all 
damage modes, be it intra-laminar (i.e. ﬁber and ma trix damage) or overall sub-
laminate modes are considered to be a function of t he non-local (averaged) equivalent 
strain deﬁned as: 
|u1D7≠≠̅/u1D6FC.ste q =/integral.v:|u1D7≠≠/u1D6FC.ste q (/u1D431)|u1D464/u1D6FC.st(/u1D41ℜ−/u1D431)|u1D4J1Ω
/Ome∧∙.st/u1D41ℜ  , 
where the subscript |u1D6F+ denotes the mode of damage: ﬁber ( |u1D6F+ = |u1D4J3 ) and matrix ( |u1D6F+ = |u1D4JA ) 
damage in each layer, /u1D458, within the sub-laminate or associated with the ov erall sub-
laminate, namely, locking ( |u1D6F+ =/u1D4:F).  Thus, for a given sub-laminate with n layers, |u1D7≠≠/u1D6FC.ste q  and 
|u1D7≠≠̅/u1D6FC.ste q  are vectors of size 2|u1D4JB + 1 .  /u1D41ℜ represents the position vector of the original poi nt of 
interest and /u1D431 denotes the position vector of all other points (G auss points) in the 
averaging zone denoted by Ω.  In classical isotropic non-local averaging appro ach, this 
zone is taken to be spherical (or circular in 2D) w ith a radius of |u1D4JF (named R1 in the 
material input card).  The parameter, |u1D4JF, which aﬀects the size of the averaging zone, 
introduces a length scale into the model that is li nked directly to the predicted size of 
the damage zone.  Averaging is done with a bell-sha ped weight function, |u1D464/u1D6FC.st, evaluated 
by 
|u1D464/u1D6FC.st=
⎣⎢⎡1 − |parenleftCvJ|u1D4J1

⎦⎥⎤|twoCst
  , 
where |u1D4J1 is the distance from the integration point of inte rest to another integration point 
within the averaging zone. 
 
The damage parameters, |u1D714/u1D6FC.st, are calculated as a function of the corresponding  averaged 
equivalent strains.  In CODAM2 the damage parameter s are assumed to grow as a 
hyperbolic function of the damage potential (non-lo cal equivalent strains) such that 
when used in conjunction with stiﬀness reduction fa ctors that vary linearly with the 
damage parameters they result in a linear strain-so ftening response (or a bilinear stress-
strain curve) for each mode of damage

where superscripts |u1D4J6 and |u1D46≠ denote, respectively, the damage initiation and sa turation 
values of the strain quantities to which they are a ssigned.  The initiation and saturation *MAT_CODAM2  *MAT_219  
 parameters are deﬁned in Cards 6 and 7. Damage is c onsidered to be a monotonically 
increasing function of time, |u1D461, such that 
|u1D714/u1D6FC.st= max 
/t∙u.st<|tCst|parenleftCv1|u1D714/u1D6FC.st/u1D̅0F.st|parenriµhtCv1  , 
where |u1D714/u1D6FC.st|u1D461Cst is the value of |u1D714/u1D6FC.st for the current time (load state), and |u1D714/u1D6FC.st/u1D̅0F.st represents the state 
of damage at previous times /u1D̅0F≤ |u1D461. 
 
Damage is applied by scaling the layer stress by re duction parameters 
|u1D44J/u1D6FC.st= 1 − |u1D714/u1D6FC.st 
where |u1D6F+ = |u1D4J3 and |u1D6F+ = |u1D4JA .  The layer stresses are summed and then then scal ed by 
reduction parameter 
|u1D44J|u1D43FCst= 1 − |u1D714|u1D43FCst  . 
Figures M219-1  (a) and (b) show the relationship between the dama ge and reduction 
parameters 
 
If the parameter RESIDS > 0, damage in the layers i s limited such that 
|u1D44J/u1D45:.st= max|parenleftCv2RESIDS, 1 − |u1D714/u1D45:.st|parenriµhtCv2
|u1D44J|u1D4JACst= max(RESIDS, 1 − |u1D714|u1D4JACst) 
Element Erosion: 
When ERODE > 0, an erosion criterion is checked at each integration point.  Shell 
elements and thick shell elements will be deleted w hen the erosion criterion has been 
met at all integration points.  Brick elements will  be deleted when the erosion criterion 
is met at any of the integration points.  For ERODE  = 1, the erosion criterion is met 
when maximum principal strain exceeds either SLOCT × ERPAR1 for elements in 
tension, or SLOCC × ERPAR1 for elements in compression.  Elements are in tension εsεi1

 when the magnitude of the ﬁrst principal strain is greater than the magnitude of the 
third principal strain and in compression when the third principal strain is larger.  
When R1 > 0, the ERODE = 1 criterion is checked usi ng the non-local (averaged) 
principal strain.  For ERODE = 2, the erosion crite rion is met when the local (non-
averaged) maximum principal strain exceeds ERPAR2.  For ERODE = 3, both of these 
erosion criteria are checked.  For visualization pu rposes, the ratio of the maximum 
principal strain over the limit is stored in the lo cation of plastic strain which is written 
by default to the elout  and d3plot  ﬁles. 
History Variables: 
History variables for CODAM2 are enumerated in the following tables.  To include 
them in the d3plot  database, use NEIPH (bricks) or NEIPS (shells) on *DATABASE_EX-
TENT_BINARY.  For brick elements, add 4 to the vari able numbers in the table because 
the ﬁrst 6 history variables are reserved.

This is  Material Type 220, a rigid material for shells or s olids.  Unlike *MAT_020, a 
*MAT_220 part can be  discretized into multiple dis joint pieces and have each piece 
behave as an independent rigid body.  The inertia p roperties for the disjoint pieces are 
determined directly from the ﬁnite element discreti zation.   
Nodes of a *MAT_220 part cannot be shared by any ot her  rigid part.  A *MAT_220 part 
may share nodes with deformable structural and soli d elements.   
This material option can be used to model granular material where the grains interact 
through an automatic single surface contact deﬁniti on.  Another possible use includes 
modeling bolts as rigid bodies where the bolts belo ng to the same part ID.  This model 
eliminates the need to represent each rigid piece w ith a unique part ID.

This is  Material Type 221.  An orthotropic material with op tional simpliﬁed damage 
and optional failure for composites can be deﬁned.  This model is valid for 3D solid 
elements, for thick shell formulations 3, 5, and 7,  and for SPH elements.  The elastic 
behavior is the same as MAT_022. Nine damage variab les are deﬁned such that damage 
is diﬀerent in tension and compression.  These dama ge variables are applicable to |u1D438|u1D44∆Cst, 
|u1D438|u1D44FCst, |u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst, |u1D43A|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst , |u1D43A|u1D44FCst|u1D4J≠Cst  and |u1D43A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst . In addition, nine failure criteria on strains are  available.  When 
failure occurs, elements are deleted (erosion).  Fa ilure depends on the number of 
integration points failed through the element.  See  the material description below.

Remarks: 
If |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J≠Cst< |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D46≠Cst , no damage is considered.  Failure occurs only whe n failure strain is reached. 
Failure can occur along the 3 orthotropic direction s, in tension, in compression and for 
shear behavior.  Nine failure strains drive the fai lure.  When failure occurs, elements are 
deleted (erosion).  Under the control of the NERODE  ﬂag, failure may occur either 
when only one integration point has failed, when se veral integration points have failed 
or when all integrations points have failed. *MAT_221  *MAT_ORTHOTROPIC_SIMPLIFIED_DAMAGE  
 Damage applies to the 3 Young’s moduli and the 3 sh ear moduli.  Damage is diﬀerent 
for tension and compression.  Nine damage variables  are used: |u1D4J1|oneCst|u1D461Cst, |u1D4J1|twoCst|u1D461Cst, |u1D4J1|threeCst|u1D461Cst, |u1D4J1|oneCst|u1D4J≠Cst, |u1D4J1|twoCst|u1D4J≠Cst, |u1D4J1|threeCst|u1D4J≠Cst,

This is  Material Type 224.  With this type, you can model a n elasto-viscoplastic material 
with arbitrary stress versus strain curve(s) and ar bitrary strain rate dependency.  Plastic 
heating causes adiabatic temperature increase and m aterial softening.  Optional plastic 
failure strain can be a function of triaxiality, st rain rate, temperature and/or element 
size.  Please take careful note of the sign convent ion for triaxiality as illustrated in 
Figure M224-1 . This material model resembles the original Johnso n-Cook material (see 
*MAT_015) but with the possibility of general tabul ated input parameters. 
 
An equation of state (*EOS) is optional for solid e lements, tshell formulations 3 and 5, 
and 2D continuum elements.  It is invoked by settin g EOSID to a nonzero value in 
*PART.  If an equation of state is used, only the d eviatoric stresses are calculated by the 
material model, and the pressure is calculated by t he equation of state.

LCK1 Load curv e ID or table ID. The load curve gives eﬀective str ess as 
a function of eﬀective plastic strain.  The table g ives for each 
plastic strain rate value a load curve ID specifyin g the 
(isothermal) eﬀective stress as a function of eﬀect ive plastic strain 
for that rate.  As in *MAT_ 024, natural logarithmic strain rates can 
be used by setting the ﬁrst  strain rate to a negative value.  See 
Remark 1 . 
LCKT Table ID deﬁning for each temperature value a load curve ID 
giving the (quasi- static) eﬀective stress versus eﬀective plastic 
strain for that temperature.  See Remark 1 . 
LCF Load curve ID or table ID. The load cur ve ID deﬁnes plastic 
failure strain (or scale factor – see Remark 2 ) as a function of 
triaxiality.  The table ID deﬁnes for each Lode par ameter a load 
curve ID giving the plastic failure strain versus t r iaxiality for that 
Lode parameter.  See Remark 2  for a description of the 
combination of LCF, LCG, LCH, and LCI. 
LCG Load curve ID deﬁning plastic failure strain (o r scale factor – see 
Remark 2 ) as a function of plastic strain rate ( The curve should not 
extrapolate to zero or failure may occur at low str ain ). If the ﬁrst 
abscissa value in the curve corresponds to a negati ve strain rate, 
LS-DY NA assumes that the natural logarithm of the strain  rate

failure strain can be a function of Lode parameter (TABLE_ 3D), 
triaxiality (TABLE), and element size (CURVE).  See  Remark 2  for 
a description of the combination of LCF, LCG, LCH, and LCI.

EQ.0: Oﬀ (default) 
EQ.1: On 
NUMAVG Number of time steps for running average of plastic  failure strain 
in the additional failure criterion.  Default is 1 (no averaging).  See 
Remark 3 . 
NCYFAIL Number of time steps that the additional fa ilure crit erion must be 
met before element deletion.  Default is 1. See Remark 3 . 
ERODE Erosion ﬂag (only for solid elements):  
EQ.0: Default, element erosion is allowed. 
EQ.1: Element does not erode; deviatoric stresse s set to zero 
when element fails. 
LCPS Table ID with ﬁrst principal stress limit as a func tion of plastic 
strain (curves) and plastic strain rate (table).  T his option is for 
post- processing purposes only and gives an indication of  areas in 
the structure where failure is likely to occur.  Hi st ory variable #17 
shows a value of 1.0 for integration points that ex ceeded the limit, 
else a value of 0.0. 
Remarks: 
1.  Flow Stress. The ﬂow stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst is expressed as a function of plastic strain |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, 
plastic strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst and temperature |u1D447 through the following formula (using 
load curves/tables LCK1 and LCKT): 
|u1D46≠|u1D466Cst=/u1D458|oneCst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst)/u1D458|u1D461Cst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D447)
/u1D458|u1D461Cst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D447|u1D44JCst) 
Note that |u1D447|u1D44JCst is a material parameter and should correspond to t he temperature 
used when performing the room temperature tensile t ests.  If simulations are to 
be performed with an initial temperature TI deviating from |u1D447|u1D44JCst, then this tem- *MAT_224  *MAT_TABULATED_JOHNSON_COOK  
 perature should be set using *INITIAL_STRESS_SOLID/ SHELL by setting 
history variable #14 for solid elements or history variable #10 for shell ele- 
ments. 
2.  Plastic Failure Strain.  Optional plastic failure strain is deﬁned as a func tion 
of triaxiality  |u1D4JD/|u1D7≠∆v m , Lode parameter, plastic strain rate  |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, temperature |u1D447 and 
initial element size /u1D45∫/c.st (square root of element area for shells and volume  over 
maximum area for solids) by

|u1D7≠∆v m |parenriµhtCvJ 
using load curves/tables LCF, LCG, LCH and LCI.  If  more than one of these 
four variables LCF, LCG, LCH and LCI are deﬁned, be  aware that the net plas- 
tic failure strain is essentially the product of mu ltiple functions as shown in the 
above equation.  This means that one and only one o f the variables LCF, LCG, 
LCH, and LCI can point to curve(s) that have plasti c strain along the curve 
ordinate.  The remaining nonzero variable(s) LCF, L CG, LCH, and LCI should 
point to curve(s) that have a unitless scaling fact or along the curve ordinate.   
A typical failure curve LCF for metal sheet, modele d with shell elements is 
shown in Figure M224-1 . Triaxiality should be monotonically increasing in  this 
curve.  A reasonable range for triaxiality is -2/3 to 2/3 if shell elements are 
used (plane stress).  For 3-dimensional stress stat es (solid elements), the possi- 
ble range of triaxiality goes from -∞ to +∞, but to  get a good resolution in the 
internal load curve discretization (depending on pa rameter LCINT of *CON-
TROL_SOLUTION) you should deﬁne lower limits, e.g. -1 to 1 if LCINT = 100 
(default).  plastic

 3.  Failure Criterion. The default failure criterion of this material mode l depends 
on plastic strain evolution |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst and on plastic failure strain |u1D7≠≠pf  and is obtained by 
accumulation over time: 
|u1D439 =/integral.v:|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst /u1D45:.st|u1D4J1|u1D461 
where element erosion takes place when |u1D439 ≥ 1.  This accumulation provides 
load-path dependent treatment of failure.  The valu e of |u1D439 is stored as history 
variable #8 for shells and #12 for solids.   
An additional, load-path independent, failure crite rion can be invoked by set- 
ting FAILOPT = 1, where the current state of plasti c strain is used: 
|u1D439|twoCst=|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst /u1D45:.st 
Two additional parameters can be used as countermea sures against stress os- 
cillations for this failure criterion.  With NUMAVG  active, plastic failure strain 
is averaged over NUMAVG time steps for the |u1D439|twoCst criterion.  The value of |u1D439|twoCst, 
taking into account any averaging per NUMAVG, is st ored as history variable 
#14 for shells and #16 for solids.  NUMAVG cannot e xceed 30. NCYFAIL de- 
ﬁnes the number of time steps that |u1D439|twoCst≥ 1 must be met before element deletion 
takes place.  The number of time steps that |u1D439|twoCst≥ 1 is stored as history variable 
#15 for shells and #19 for solids. 
4.  Change in Temperature.  Temperature increase is caused by plastic work 
|u1D447 = |u1D447|u1D44JCst+|u1D6FD
|u1D436|u1D4JDCst|u1D7≠+/integral.v:|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst|u1D4J1|u1D461 
with room temperature |u1D447|u1D44JCst, dissipation factor |u1D6FD, speciﬁc heat |u1D436|u1D4JDCst, and density |u1D7≠+. 
If a coupled thermal/structural analysis is perform ed, temperatures from the 
thermal solver are used.  In that case, the plastic  work that is to be converted to 
hear is transferred to the thermal solver as additi onal volumetric heat source.  
If no dissipation factor is deﬁned, the value of FW ORK in *CONTROL_THER-
MAL_SOLVER is used. 
5.  Failure when used with *CONSTRAINED_TIED_NODES_WITH _FAILURE.  
For *CONSTRAINED_TIED_NODES_WITH_FAILURE, the failu re is based on 
the damage instead to the plastic strain. 
6.  History Variables.  History variables may be post-processed through 
additional variables.  The number of additional var iables for shells/solids writ- 
ten to the d3plot  and d3thdt  databases is input by the optional *DATABASE_-
EXTENT_BINARY card as variable NEIPS/NEIPH. Speciﬁc ally, when used 
with shell element type 14 or 15, history variable output will be as a solid ele- *MAT_224  *MAT_TABULATED_JOHNSON_COOK

that the natu ral logarithm of the strain rate value is used.  Si nce 
the tables are internally discretized to equally sp ace the points, 
natural logarithms are necessary, for example, if t he curves 
correspond to rates from 10 -4 to 10 4.

 *MAT_KINEMATIC_HARDENING_BARLAT89 _{OPTION}  
This is  Material Type 226.  This model combines the Yoshida  & Uemori non-linear 
kinematic hardening rule (*MAT_125) with the 3-para meter material model of Barlat 
and Lian [1989] (*MAT_36) to model metal sheets und er cyclic plasticity loading with 
anisotropy in plane stress condition.  Lankford par ameters are used for the deﬁnition of 
the anisotropy.  Yoshida’s theory describes the har dening rule with a “two surfaces” 
method: the yield surface and the bounding surface.   In the forming process, the yield 
surface does not change in size, but its center mov es with deformation; the bounding 
surface changes both in size and location. 
 
Available options include: 
<BLANK> 
NLP 
The NLP option estimates necking failure using the Formability Index (F.I.), which 
accounts for the non-linear strain paths seen in me tal forming applications (see Remark 
4).  When using this option, specify IFLD in Card 3.   Since the NLP option also works 
with a linear strain path, it is recommended to be used as the default failure criterion in 
metal forming.  The NLP option is also available fo r *MAT_036, *MAT_037, and 
*MAT_226.

Remarks: 
1.  Unboundedness.   A layer of this material may be placed at a bound ary of a 
bounded domain to simulate unboundedness of the dom ain at that boundary: 
the layer absorbs and attenuates waves propagating outward from the domain, 
without any signiﬁcant reﬂection of the waves back into the bounded domain.  
The layer cannot support any static displacement.  
2.  Bounded Domain Material Properties.  It is assumed the material in the 
bounded domain near the layer is, or behaves like, an isotropic linear elastic 
material.  The material properties of the layer sho uld be set to the correspond- 
ing properties of this material.  
3.  Layer Geometry.  The layer should form a cuboid box around the bound ed 
domain, with the axes of the box aligned with the c oordinate axes.  Various *MAT_PML_ELASTIC  *MAT_230  
 faces of this box may be open, as required by the g eometry of the problem.  For 
example, for a half-space problem, the “top” of the  box should be open. 
Internally, LS-DYNA will partition the entire PML i nto regions which form the 
“faces,” “edges” and “corners” of the above cuboid box, and generate a new 
material for each region.  This partitioning will b e visible in the d3plot  ﬁle.  The 
user may safely ignore this partitioning. 
4.  Number of Elements in Layer.   The layer should have 5-10 elements through 
its depth.  Typically, 5-6 elements are suﬃcient if  the excitation source is rea- 
sonably distant from the layer, and 8-10 elements i f it is close.  The size of the 
elements should be similar to that of elements in t he bounded domain near the 
layer, and should be small enough to suﬃciently dis cretize all signiﬁcant 
wavelengths in the problem. 
5.  Nodal Constraints.   The nodes on the outer boundary of the layer shou ld be 
fully constrained.  
6.  Stress and Strain.   The stress and strain values reported by this mat erial do 
not have any physical signiﬁcance. *MAT_230_FLUID  *MAT_PML_ELASTIC_FLUID  
 *MAT_PML_ELASTIC_FLUID  
This is  Material Type 230_FLUID.  This is a perfectly-match ed layer (PML) material

a ﬂuid material (*MAT_ELASTIC_FLUID) in order to si mulate wave propagation in an 
unbounded ﬂuid medium.  See the Remarks sections of  *MAT_PML_ELASTIC (*MAT_-

Remarks: 
1.  Unboundedness.  A layer of this material may be placed at a boundar y of a 
bounded domain to simulate unboundedness of the dom ain at that boundary: 
the layer absorbs and attenuates waves propagating outward from the domain, 
without any signiﬁcant reﬂection of the waves back into the bounded domain.  
The layer cannot support any hydrostatic pressure. 
2.  Material in Bounded Domain.   It is assumed the material in the bounded 
domain near the layer is an acoustic material.  The  material properties of the 
layer should be set to the corresponding properties  of this material.  
3.  Layer Geometry.   The layer should form a cuboid box around the bou nded 
domain, with the axes of the box aligned with the c oordinate axes.  Various 
faces of this box may be open, as required by the g eometry of the problem, e.g., 
for a half-space problem, the “top” of the box shou ld be open. *MAT_231  *MAT_PML_ACOUSTIC  
 Internally, LS-DYNA will partition the entire PML i nto regions which form the

4.  Number of Elements in Layer.   The layer should have 5 - 10 elements through 
its depth.  Typically, 5 - 6 elements are suﬃcient if the excitation source is rea- 
sonably distant from the layer, and 8 - 10 elements  if it is close.  The size of the 
elements should be similar to that of elements in t he bounded domain near the 
layer, and should be small enough to suﬃciently dis cretize all signiﬁcant

(2001), Makris and Zhang (2000), Muscolini, Palmeri  and Ricciardelli (2005)].  The 
hysteretic damping coeﬃcient for the model is compu ted from a prescribed damping 
ratio by calibrating with an equivalent viscous dam ping model for a single-degree-of-
freedom system.  The damping increases the stiﬀness  of the model and thus reduces the 
computed time-step size.

Remarks: 
1.  Stress.   The stress is computed as a function of the strai n rate as 
|u1D7≠∆(|u1D461) =/integral.v:|u1D436|u1D44JCst(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D7≠≠̇(/u1D̅0F)|u1D461Cst
|zeroCst|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F  
where *MAT_232  *MAT_BIOT_HYSTERETIC  
 |u1D436|u1D44JCst(|u1D461) = |u1D436 |<racketleftCvJ1 +2|u1D7≠2
/u1D̅0B|u1D438|oneCst|parenleftCv1|u1D6FD|u1D461|parenriµhtCv1|<racketriµhtCvJ . 
In the above, |u1D436 is the elastic isotropic constitutive tensor, |u1D7≠2 is the hysteretic 
damping factor, and |u1D6FD = 2/u1D̅0B|u1D4J3/u1D451.st/10 , where |u1D4J3/u1D451.st is the dominant excitation frequen- 
cy in Hz.  The function |u1D438|oneCst is given by 
|u1D438|oneCst(|u1D46≠) =/integral.v:e−/u1Dℜ09.st
/u1D̅0∫|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0∫∞
|u1D46≠Cst 
For eﬃcient implementation, this function is approx imated by a 5-term Prony 
series as 
|u1D438|oneCst(|u1D46≠) ≈ |summationCv1 |u1D44F|u1D4J8Cste|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J8Csts|u1D46≠Cst|fiveCst
|u1D4J8Cst=|oneCst , 
such that |u1D44F|u1D4J8Cst> 0. 
2.  Hysteretic Damping Factor.   The hysteretic damping factor |u1D7≠2 is obtained 
from the prescribed damping ratio /u1Dℜ0D as  
|u1D7≠2 =/u1D̅0B /u1Dℜ0D/atan(10) = 2.14 /u1Dℜ0D 
by assuming that, for a single degree-of-freedom sy stem, the energy dissipated 
per cycle by the hysteretic material is the same as  that by a viscous damper, if 
the excitation frequency matches the natural freque ncy of the system. 
3.  Young’s Modulus.   The consistent Young’s modulus for this model is given by  
|u1D438|u1D4J≠Cst= |u1D438|<racketleftCvJ1 +2|u1D7≠2
/u1D̅0B|u1D4J4|<racketriµhtCvJ  , 
where 
|u1D4J4 = |summationCv1 |u1D44F|u1D4J8Cst1
|u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D6FD∆|u1D461|u1D4JBCst|<racketleftCv1exp|parenleftCv1|u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D6FD∆|u1D461|u1D4JBCst|parenriµhtCv1 − 1|<racketriµhtCv1|fiveCst
|u1D4J8Cst=|oneCst  . 
Because |u1D4J4 > 0 , the computed element time-step size is smaller th an that for the 
corresponding elastic element.  Furthermore, the ti me-step size computed at 
any time depends on the previous time-step size.  I t can be demonstrated that 
the new computed time-step size stays within a narr ow range of the previous 
time-step size and for a uniform mesh, converges to  a constant value.  For |u1D4J3/u1D451.st=
3.25 Hz and /u1Dℜ0D= 0.05 , the percentage decrease in time-step size can be expected 
to be about 12 - 15% for initial time-step sizes of  less than 0.02 secs, and about 
7 - 10% for initial time-step sizes larger than 0.0 2 secs. 
4.  Dominant Frequency.   The default value of the dominant frequency is ch osen 
to be valid for earthquake excitation. *MAT_CAZACU_BARLAT  *MAT_233  
 *MAT_CAZACU_BARLAT  
This is  Material Type 233.  This material model is for Hexa gonal Closed Packet (HCP) 
metals and is based on the work by Cazacu et al.  ( 2006).  This model is capable of 
describing the yielding asymmetry between tension a nd compression for such 
materials.  Moreover, a parameter ﬁt is optional an d can be used to ﬁnd the material 
parameters that describe the experimental yield str esses.  The experimental data that 
you should supply consists of yield stresses for te nsion and compression in the 00 
direction, tension in the 45 and the 90 directions,  and a biaxial tension test. 
 
Available options include: 
<BLANK> 
MAGNESIUM 
Including MAGNESIUM invokes a material model develo ped by the USAMP 
consortium to simulate cast Magnesium under impact loading.  The model includes rate 
eﬀects having a tabulated failure model including e quivalent plastic strain to failure as 
a function of stress triaxiality and eﬀective plast ic strain rate.  Element erosion will 
occur when the number of integration points where t he damage variable has reached 
unity reaches some speciﬁed threshold (NUMINT).  Al ternatively, a Gurson type failure 
model can be activated, which requires less experim ental data. 
 
You must provide the evolution of the Cazacu-Barlat  eﬀective stress as a function of the 
energy conjugate plastic strain in the input for th e hardening curve for MAT_233. With 
the MAGNESIUM option an alternative option for the hardening curve is available: von 
Mises eﬀective stress as a function of equivalent p lastic strain, which is energy 
conjugate to the von Mises stress. 
 
Finally, the MAGNESIUM option allows for distortion al hardening by providing 
hardening curves as measured in tension and compres sion tests.  This option is 
however incompatible with the activation of rate eﬀ ects (visco-plasticity). 
 
With the MAGNESIUM option this material model is al so available for solid elements. 
NOTE:  Activating the MAGNESIUM options requires  setting 
HR = 3 and FIT = 0.0 (also see below).

Remarks: 
This material model (*MAT_CAZACU_BARLAT) aims to mo del materials with 
strength diﬀerential and orthotropic behavior under  plane stress.  The yield condition 
includes a parameter /u1D458 that describes the asymmetry between yield in tensi on and 
compression.  Moreover, to include the anisotropic behavior the stress deviator, /u1D412, 
undergoes a linear transformation.  The principal v alues of the Cauchy stress deviator 
are substituted with the principal values of the tr ansformed tensor,  /u1D419, which is 
represented as a vector ﬁeld, deﬁned as: *MAT_CAZACU_BARLAT  *MAT_233  
 /u1D419=/u1D402/u1D412   . (233.1) 
Here /u1D412 is the ﬁeld comprised of the four stresses deviato r components, |u1D446/u1D4:C.st=
(|u1D46≠|oneCst|oneCst , |u1D46≠|twoCst|twoCst , |u1D46≠|threeCst|threeCst , |u1D46≠|oneCst|twoCst ), 
/u1D42C=σ−1
3tr(σ)δ  . 
In the above equation, tr(σ) is the trace of the Cauchy stress tensor and δ is the 
Kronecker delta.  For the 2D plane stress condition , the orthotropic condition gives 7 
independent coeﬃcients.  The tensor /u1D402 is represented by the 4 × 4  matrix

where |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2 is a function representing the current yield stres s dependent on current 
eﬀective plastic strain and /u1D458 is the asymmetric parameter for yield in compressi on and

|u1D7≠∆eff =[(|Σ|oneCst|−/u1D458Σ|oneCst)|u1D44∆Cst+(|Σ|twoCst|−/u1D458Σ|twoCst)|u1D44∆Cst+(|dividesCv1Σ|threeCst|dividesCv1−/u1D458Σ|threeCst)|u1D44∆Cst]|oneCst|u1D44∆Cst/fraction.v1  , (233.3) 
where /u1D458∈[−1,1]  and |u1D44∆ ≥ 1.  Now, let |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst|zeroCst |u1D447Cst and |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst|zeroCst /u1D4:6.st represent the yield stress along the

Hardening laws: 
The following hardening laws are implemented: 
1.  Swift hardening law 
2.  Voce hardening law 
3.  Gosh hardening law 
4.  Hocket-Sherby hardening law 
5.  Loading curve, where the yield stress is given as a function of the eﬀective 
plastic strain 
 
The Swift’s hardening law can be written as 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2 =/u1D45E|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|zeroCst+ |u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2|u1D4JBCst 
where /u1D45E and |u1D4JB are material parameters.  
The Voce’s equation says that the yield stress can be written in the following form 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst ep  
where |u1D44∆, |u1D44F, and /u1D450 are material parameters.  The Gosh’s equation is s imilar to Swift’s 
equation.  They only diﬀer by a constant 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2 =/u1D45E|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|zeroCst+ |u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2|u1D4JBCst− |u1D4JD  . 
Here /u1D45E, |u1D7≠≠|zeroCst, |u1D4JB and |u1D4JD are material constants.  The Hocket-Sherby equatio n resembles the 
Voce’s equation, but with an additional parameter a dded 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst ep /u1D45B.sts
  , 
where |u1D44∆, |u1D44F,/u1D450 and |u1D4JB are material parameters. 
Constitutive relation and material stiffness: 
The classical elastic constitutive equation for lin ear deformations is the well-known 
Hooke’s law.  This relation written in a rate formu lation is given by 
/u1D6D4̇=/u1D40:ε̇|u1D4J2Cst  , (233.8) 
where ε|u1D4J2Cst is the elastic strain and /u1D40: is the constitutive matrix.  An over imposed dot 
indicates diﬀerentiation respect to time.  Introduc ing the total strain, ε, and the plastic 
strain, ε|u1D4JDCst, Eq.  (233.8) is classically rewritten as *MAT_233  *MAT_CAZACU_BARLAT

The parameters |u1D438and |u1D463 are the Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio, respe ctively.  
The material stiﬀness /u1D40:|u1D4JDCst that is needed for implicit analysis can be calcul ated from 
Equation (233.9)  as 
/u1D40:|u1D4JDCst=∂/u1D6D4̇
∂ε̇  . 
The associative ﬂow rule for the plastic strain is usually written as 
ε̇|u1D4JDCst=|u1D7≠6̇∂|u1D4J3
∂/u1D6D4  , (233.10)

Note that the centralized “dot” means scalar produc t between two vectors.  Using

To be able to do a stress update we need to calcula te the tangent stiﬀness and the 
derivative with respect to the corresponding harden ing law. 
When a suitable hardening law has been chosen the c orresponding derivative is simple

Implementation: 
Assume that the stress and strain is known at time |u1D461|u1D4JBCst. A trial stress σ/tilℂecomb.h1|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst at time |u1D461|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst is 
calculated by assuming a pure elastic deformation, that is,

Now, if |u1D4J3 (Σ,/u1D458, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J2Cst|u1D4JDCst ) ≤ 0 , the deformation is purely elastic, and the new st ress and plastic 
strain are determined as

If the deformation is not purely elastic, the stres s is not inside the yield surface and a 
plastic iterative procedure must take place as desc ribed in the following: 
1.  Set |u1D4JA = 0,  /u1D6D4(|zeroCst)|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst=/u1D6D4/tilℂecomb.h1|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst, |u1D7≠≠ep (|zeroCst)|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D7≠≠ep |u1D4JBCst and ∆|u1D7≠≠|oneCst|oneCst |u1D4JDCst(|zeroCst)= ∆|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|twoCst |u1D4JDCst(|zeroCst)= 0 *MAT_233  *MAT_CAZACU_BARLAT

Otherwise set |u1D4JA = |u1D4JA + 1 and return to 2.

This is  Material Type 234 developed and implemented by Tabi ei et al [2004].  The model 
is a mechanism incorporating the crimping of the ﬁb ers as well as the trellising with 
reorientation of the yarns and the locking phenomen on observed in loose fabric.  The 
equilibrium of the mechanism allows the straighteni ng of the ﬁbers depending on the 
ﬁber tension.  The contact force at the ﬁber cross over point determines the rotational 
friction that dissipates a part of the impact energ y.  The stress-strain relationship is 
viscoelastic based on a three-element model.  The f ailure of the ﬁbers is strain rate 
dependent.  *DAMPING_PART_MASS is recommended to be  used in conjunction with 
this material model.  This material is valid for mo deling the elastic and viscoelastic

 Remarks: 
The parameters of the Representative Volume Cell (R VC) are: the yarn span, |u1D46≠, the 
fabric thickness, |u1D461, the yarn width, |u1D464, and the yarn cross-sectional area, |u1D434. The initially 
orthogonal yarns (see Figure M234-2 a) are free to rotate (see Figure M234-2 b) up to 
some angle and after that the lateral contact betwe en the yarns causes the locking of the 
trellis mechanism and the packing of the yarns (see  Figure M234-2 c).The minimum 
braid angle, /u1D̅0:min , can be calculated from the geometry and the archi tecture of the fabric 
material having the yarn width, |u1D464, and the span between the yarns, |u1D46≠: 
sin(2/u1D̅0:|mCst|iCst|nCst ) =|u1D464
|u1D46≠  . 
The range angle, /u1D̅0:loc k , and the maximum braid angle, /u1D̅0:max , are then easily determined 
as: 
/u1D̅0:loc k = 45 °−/u1D̅0:|mCst|iCst|nCst   ,      /u1D̅0:|mCst|aCst|xCst = 45 °+/u1D̅0:loc k    
 
The material behavior of the yarn can be simply des cribed by a combination of one 
Maxwell element without the dashpot and one Kelvin- Voigt element.  The 1-D model of 
viscoelasticity is shown in Figure M234-3 . The diﬀerential equation of viscoelasticity of 
the yarns can be derived from the model equilibrium  as in the following equation: 
(|u1D43∆|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D43∆|u1D44FCst)|u1D7≠∆ + |u1D7≠7|u1D44FCst|u1D7≠∆̇= |u1D43∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D43∆|u1D44FCst|u1D7≠≠ + |u1D7≠7|u1D44FCst|u1D43∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D7≠≠̇

The stress in the yarns for the ﬁll and warp is upd ated for the next time step as:  
|u1D7≠∆/u1D45:.st(|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst)= |u1D7≠∆/u1D45:.st(|u1D4JBCst)+ ∆|u1D7≠∆/u1D45:.st(|u1D4JBCst), |u1D7≠∆|u1D464Cst(|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst)= |u1D7≠∆|u1D464Cst(|u1D4JBCst)+ ∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D464Cst(|u1D4JBCst) 
where ∆|u1D7≠∆/u1D45:.st and ∆|u1D7≠∆|u1D464Cst are the stress increments in the yarns.  We can im agine that the 
RVC is smeared to the parallelepiped in order to tr ansform the stress acting on the yarn 
cross-section to the stress acting on the element w all.  The thickness of the membrane 
shell element used should be equal to the eﬀective thickness, |u1D461|u1D4J2Cst, that can be found by 
dividing the areal density of the fabric by its mas s density.  The in-plane stress 
components acting on the RVC walls in the material direction of the yarns are 
calculated as follows for the ﬁll and warp directio ns: 
|u1D7≠∆/u1D45:.st|oneCst|oneCst (|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst)=2|u1D7≠∆/u1D45:.st(|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst)|u1D446

This is  Material Type 235 developed and implemented by Tabi ei et al [2001].  The 
material model derivation includes the micro-mechan ical approach and the 
homogenization technique usually used in composite material models.  The model 
accounts for reorientation of the yarns and the fab ric architecture.  The behavior of the 
ﬂexible fabric material is achieved by discounting the shear moduli of the material in 
free state which allows the simulation of the trell is mechanism before packing the yarns.  
This material is valid for modeling the elastic res ponse of loose fabric used in inﬂatable 
structures, parachutes, body armor, blade containme nts, and airbags.

Remarks: 
The Representative Volume Cell (RVC) approach is us ed in the micro-mechanical

angles – the braid angle, /u1D̅0: (the initial braid angle is 45 degrees) , and the undulation angle 
of the yarn, which is diﬀerent for the ﬁll and warp -yarns, |u1D6FD/u1D45:.st and |u1D6FD|u1D464Cst (the initial

When locking occurs, the fabric yarns are packed an d behave like elastic media.  The 
discount factor is unity as shown in the next ﬁgure .  The micro-mechanical model is 
developed to account for the reorientation of the y arns up to the locking angle.  The 
locking angle, /u1D̅0:loc k , can be obtained from the yarn width and the spaci ng parameter of 
the fabric using simple geometrical relationship.  The transition range, ∆/u1D̅0: (angle 
tolerance for locking), can be chosen to be as smal l as possible, but big enough to 
prevent high frequency oscillations during the tran sition to the compacted state which 
depends on the range to the locking angle and the d ynamics of the simulated problem.  
The reorientation damping constant damps some of th e high frequency oscillations.  A 
simple rate eﬀect is added by deﬁning the viscous m odulus for normal or shear strain 
rate ( V ME × |u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst|oneCst or |twoCst|twoCst  for normal components and V MS × |u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst|twoCst  for the shear components).

This is  Material Type 236 developed by Carney, Lee, Goldber g, and Santhanam [2007].  
This model simulates silicon carbide coating on Rei nforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC), a 
ceramic matrix.  It is based upon a quasi-orthotrop ic, linear-elastic, plane-stress model.  
Additional constitutive model attributes include a simple (meaning non-damage model 
based) option that can model the tension crack requ irement: a “stress-cutoﬀ” in tension.  
This option satisﬁes the tension crack requirements  by limiting the stress in tension but 
not compression and having the tensile “yielding” ( that is, the stress-cutoﬀ) be fully 
recoverable – not plasticity or damage based.

Additional constitutive model requirements include a simple (meaning non-damage 
model based) option that can model the tension crac k requirement: a “stress-cutoﬀ” in 
tension.  This option satisﬁes the tension crack re quirements by limiting the stress in 
tension but not compression and having the tensile “yielding” (that is, the stress-cutoﬀ) 
be fully recoverable – not plasticity or damage bas ed. 
 
The tension stress-cutoﬀ separately resets the stre ss to a limit value when it is exceeded 
in each of the two principal directions.  There is also a strain-based memory criterion 
that ensures unloading follows the same path as loa ding: the “memory criterion” is the 
tension stress assuming that no stress cutoﬀs were in eﬀect.  In this way, when the 
memory criterion exceeds the user-speciﬁed cutoﬀ st ress, the actual stress will be set to 
that value.  When the element unloads and the memor y criterion falls back below the 
stress cutoﬀ, normal behavior resumes.  Using this criterion is a simple way to ensure 
that unloading does not result in any hysteresis.  The cutoﬀ criterion cannot be based on 
an eﬀective stress value because eﬀective stress do es not discriminate between tension 
and compression while also including shear.  This m eans that the in plane, 1- and 2- 
directions must be modeled as independent to use th e stress cutoﬀ.  Because the 
Poisson’s ratio is not zero, this assumption is not  true for cracks that may arbitrarily lie 
along any direction.  However, careful examination of damaged RCC shows that the 
surface cracks do, generally, tend to lie in the fa bric directions, meaning that cracks tend 
to open in the 1- or the 2- direction independently .  So the assumption of directional 
independence for tension cracks may be appropriate for the coating because of this 
observed orthotropy. 
 *MAT_236  *MAT_SCC_ON_RCC  
 The quasi-orthotropic, linear-elastic, plane-stress  model with tension stress cutoﬀ (to 
simulate tension cracks) can model the as-fabricate d coating properties, which do not 
show nonlinearities, but not the non-linear respons e of the ﬂight-degraded material.  
Explicit ﬁnite element analysis (FEA) lends itself to nonlinear-elastic  stress-strain relation 
instead of linear-elastic.  Thus, instead of /u1D̅48=/u1D404/u1D̅:A, the modulus will be deﬁned as a 
function of some eﬀective strain quantity, or /u1D̅48=/u1D404(/u1D̅:Aeff )/u1D̅:A, even though it is uncertain, 
from the available data, whether the coating respon se is completely nonlinear-elastic 
and does not include some damage mechanism. 
 
This nonlinear-elastic model cannot be implemented into a closed form solution or into 
an implicit solver; however, for explicit FEA such as is used for LS-DYNA impact 
analysis, the modulus can be adjusted at each time step to a higher or lower value as 
desired.  In order to model the desired S-shape res ponse curve of ﬂight-degraded RCC 
coating, a function of strain that replicates the d esired response must be found.  The 
nonlinearities in the material are assumed recovera ble (elastic) and the modulus is 
assumed to be communicative between the 1- and 2- d irections (going against the 
tension-crack assumption that the two directions do  not interact).  Sometimes stability 
can be a problem for this type of nonlinearity mode ling; however, stability was not 
found to be a problem with the material constants u sed for the coating. 
 
The von Mises strain is selected for the eﬀective s train deﬁnition as it couples the 3-
dimensional loading but reduces to uniaxial data, s o that the desired uniaxial 
compressive response can be reproduced.  So,

|u1D7≠≠|threeCst=−/u1D̅08
1 −/u1D̅08(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst+ |u1D7≠≠|twoCst) . 
The function for modulus is implemented as an arbit rary 5 th  order polynomial: 
|u1D438(|u1D7≠≠eff ) = |u1D434|zeroCst|u1D7≠≠eff |zeroCst+ |u1D434|oneCst|u1D7≠≠eff |oneCst+⋯+ |u1D434|fiveCst|u1D7≠≠eff |fiveCst  . 
In the case of as-fabricated material the ﬁrst coeﬃ cient, |u1D434|zeroCst, is simply the modulus |u1D438, 
and the other coeﬃcients, |u1D434|u1D4JBCst>|zeroCst, are zero, reducing to a 0 th  order polynomial, or linear.  
To match the degraded stress-strain compression cur ve, a higher order polynomial is 
needed.  Six conditions on stress were used (stress  and its derivative at beginning, 
middle, and end of the curve) to obtain a 5 th  order polynomial, and then the derivative 
of that equation was taken to obtain modulus as a f unction of strain, yielding a 4 th  order 
polynomial that represents the degraded coating mod ulus as strain curve. 
 
For values of strain which exceed the failure strai n observed in the laminate 
compression tests, the higher order polynomial will  no longer match the test data.  
Therefore, after a speciﬁed eﬀective-strain, repres enting failure, the modulus is deﬁned *MAT_SCC_ON_RCC  *MAT_236  
 to be the tangent of the polynomial curve.  As a re sult, the stress/strain response has a 
continuous derivative, which aids in avoiding numer ical instabilities.  The test data 
does not clearly deﬁne the failure strain of the co ating, but in the impact test it appears 
that the coating has a higher compressive failure s train in bending than the laminate 
failure strain. 
 
The two dominant modes of loading which cause coati ng loss on the impact side of the 
RCC (the front-side) are in-plane compression and t ransverse shear.  The in-plane 
compression is measured by the peak out of plane te nsile strain,  |u1D7≠≠|threeCst.  As there is no 
direct loading of a shell element in this direction , |u1D7≠≠|threeCst is computed through Poisson’s 
relation:  
|u1D7≠≠|threeCst=−|u1D463
1 − |u1D463(|u1D7≠≠|oneCst+ |u1D7≠≠|twoCst)  . 
When |u1D7≠≠|threeCst is tensile, it implies that the average of |u1D7≠≠|oneCst and |u1D7≠≠|twoCst is compressive.  This failure 
mode will likely dominate when the RCC undergoes la rge bending, putting the front-
side coating in high compressive strains.  A transv erse shear failure mode is expected to 
dominate when the debris source is very hard or ver y fast.  By deﬁnition, the shell 
element cannot give a precise account of the transv erse shear throughout the RCC’s 
thickness.  However, the Belytschko-Tsay shell elem ent formulation in LS-DYNA has a 
ﬁrst-order approximation of transverse shear that i s based on the out-of-plane nodal 
displacements and rotations that should suﬃce to gi ve a qualitative evaluation of the 
transverse shear.  By this formulation, the transve rse shear is constant through the 
entire shell thickness and thus violates surface-tr action conditions.  The constitutive 
model implementation records the peak value of the tensile out-of-plane strain ( |u1D7≠≠|threeCst) and 
peak root-mean-sum transverse-shear: /radical.v2|u1D7≠≠|oneCst|threeCst |twoCst+ |u1D7≠≠|twoCst|threeCst |twoCst.*MAT_237  *MAT_PML_HYSTERETIC

This is Material Type 240.  This model is a rate-de pendent, elastic-ideally plastic 
cohesive zone model.  It includes a tri-linear trac tion-separation law with a quadratic 
yield and damage initiation criterion in mixed-mode  loading (mode I – mode II), while 
the damage evolution is governed by a power-law for mulation.  It can be used only 
with cohesive element formulations; see the variabl e ELFORM in *SECTION_SOLID 
and *SECTION_SHELL. 
With the THERMAL option, some properties are deﬁned  as functions of temperature, 
meaning ﬁelds EMOD, GMOD, G1C_0, G2C_0, T0, S0, FG1 , and FG2 must be deﬁned as 
curve IDs instead of scalar values. 
With the FUNCTIONS option, some properties are deﬁn ed as functions of connection 
partner properties, meaning ﬁelds EMOD, GMOD, G1C_0 , G2C_0, T0, S0, FG1, and FG2 
must be deﬁned as function IDs instead of scalar va lues.  See remarks for details. 
The keyword option 3MODES activates the possibility  to include deformation/fracture 
mode III which could be useful for cohesive shells.   Corresponding ﬁelds can be deﬁned 
on optional Cards 4 and 5. 
Note that 3MODES is compatible with THERMAL and FUN CTIONS, but THERMAL 
and FUNCTIONS cannot be used together.  In other wo rds, THERMAL_3MODES and 
FUNCTIONS_3MODES are allowed as keyword options, bu t THERMAL_FUNCTIONS

Remarks: 
The model is a tri-linear elastic-ideally plastic C ohesive Zone Model, developed by 
Marzi et al.  [2009].  It looks similar to *MAT_185  but considers eﬀects of plasticity and 
rate-dependency.  Since the entire separation at fa ilure is plastic, no brittle fracture 
behavior can be modeled with this material type. 
 
The following description of the model is for two d eformation/fracture modes (I and II) 
only, meaning without the option 3MODES. This is a natural choice for cohesive solid 
elements, where no speciﬁc distinction between in-p lane and out-of-plane shear can be 
made.  On the other hand, if this material model is  used with the cohesive shell element 
type ±29, shear deformation can clearly be separate d into in-plane shear (Mode II) and 
out-of-plane shear (Mode III).  This can be taken i nto account by adding 3MODES to the 
keyword and deﬁning additional Cards 4 and 5. Corre sponding equations including 
Mode III are not explicitly given here (for the sak e of brevity), but derivation of them is 
straightforward.  
 
The separations, ∆|u1D4JBCst and ∆|u1D461Cst, in the normal (peel) and tangential (shear) direc tions, 
respectively, are calculated from the element’s sep arations in the integration points, 
∆|u1D4JBCst= max (|u1D462|u1D4JBCst, 0) 
and 
∆|u1D461Cst=/radical.v2|u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst|twoCst+ |u1D462|u1D461Cst|twoCst|twoCst  . 
|u1D462|u1D4JBCst is the separation in the normal direction while |u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst and |u1D462|u1D461Cst|twoCst is the separation in both 
tangential directions of the element coordinate sys tem.  The total (mixed-mode) 
separation ∆|u1D4JACst is determined by 
∆|u1D4JACst=/radical.v2∆|u1D4JBCst|twoCst+ ∆|u1D461Cst|twoCst  .

where THICK, the element’s thickness, is an input p arameter.  If THICK ≤ 0, it is 
calculated from the distance between the initial po sitions of the element’s corner nodes 
(Nodes 1-5, 2-6, 3-7 and 4-8, respectively). 
 
While the total energy under the traction-separatio n law is given by |u1D43A/u1D4:6.st, one further 
parameter is needed to describe the exact shape of the tri-linear material model.  If the 
area (energy) under the constant stress (plateau) r egion is denoted |u1D43A|u1D443Cst (see Fig- 
ure M240-1 ), a parameter |u1D4J3/u1D4:A.st deﬁnes the shape of the traction-separation law, 
0 ≤ |u1D4J3/u1D4:A.st|oneCst=|u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D443Cst

As a recommended alternative, the shape of the tri- linear model can be described by the 
following displacement ratios (triggered by negativ e input values for |u1D4J3/u1D4:A.st):

|u1D447|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠̇e q |parenriµhtCv2 = |T0| + |T1| |<racketleftCv6max |parenleftCv60, ln |u1D7≠≠̇e q 
EDOT _T|parenriµhtCv6|<racketriµhtCv6|twoCst
  for mode I if T0 < 0 and T1 > 0
|u1D446|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠̇e q |parenriµhtCv2 = |S0| + |S1| |<racketleftCv6max |parenleftCv60, ln |u1D7≠≠̇e q 
EDOT _S|parenriµhtCv6|<racketriµhtCv6|twoCst
  for mode II if S0 < 0 and S1 > 0 
2.  A linear logarithmic function: 
|u1D447|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠̇e q |parenriµhtCv2 = |T0| + |T1|max |parenleftCv60, ln |u1D7≠≠̇e q 
EDOT _T|parenriµhtCv6   for mode I if T0 < 0 and T1 < 0
|u1D446|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠̇e q |parenriµhtCv2 = |S0| + |S1|max |parenleftCv60, ln |u1D7≠≠̇e q 
EDOT _S|parenriµhtCv6   for mode II if S0 < 0 and S1 < 0 
Alternatively, |u1D447 and |u1D446 can be set to constant values: 
|u1D447|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠̇e q |parenriµhtCv2 = T0   for mode I if T0 > 0
|u1D446|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠̇e q |parenriµhtCv2 = S0 for mode II if S0 > 0 
 
The rate-dependency of the fracture energies are gi ven by: 
|u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:6.st |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠̇e q |parenriµhtCv2 = |G1C _0| + (G1C _INF − |G1C _0|)exp |parenleftCv6−EDOT _G1 
|u1D7≠≠̇e q |parenriµhtCv6   if G1C _0 < 0
|u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:6.st |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠̇e q |parenriµhtCv2 = |G2C _0| + (G2C _INF − |G2C _0|)exp |parenleftCv6−EDOT _G2 
|u1D7≠≠̇e q |parenriµhtCv6   if G2C _0 < 0 
If positive values are chosen for G1C_0 or G2C_0, n o rate-dependency is considered for 
this parameter and its value remains constant as sp eciﬁed by the user. 
 
As an alternative, fracture energies GIC and GIIC c an be deﬁned as functions of 
cohesive element thickness by using load curves LCG 1C and LCG2C, respectively.  In 
that case, parameters G1C_0, G1C_INF, G2C_0, and G2 C_INF will be ignored and no 
rate dependence is considered. 
 
Note that the equivalent strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇e q  is updated until ∆|u1D4JACst> |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|oneCst, then the model 
behavior depends on the equivalent strain rate at y ield initiation. 
 
Having deﬁned the parameters describing the single modes, the mixed-mode behavior 
is formulated by quadratic initiation criteria for both yield stress and damage initiation, 
while the damage evolution follows a Power-Law.  Du e to reasons of readability, the 
following simpliﬁcations are made, *MAT_COHESIVE_MIXED_MODE_ELASTOPLASTIC_RATE  *MAT_240  
 |u1D447 = |u1D447|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠̇e q |parenriµhtCv2
|u1D446 = |u1D446|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠̇e q |parenriµhtCv2
|u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:6.st = |u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:6.st |parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠̇e q |parenriµhtCv2
|u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:6.st = |u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:6.st (|u1D7≠≠̇e q ) 
If the quadratic nominal stress criterion is used ( INICRT = 0), the mixed-mode yield 
initiation displacement |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|oneCst is deﬁned as 
|u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|oneCst= |u1D6FF|u1D4JBCst|oneCst|u1D6FF|u1D461Cst|oneCst/radical.v61 + |u1D6FD|twoCst
|u1D6FF|u1D461Cst|oneCst|twoCst+ |parenleftCv1|u1D6FD|u1D6FF|u1D4JBCst|oneCst|parenriµhtCv1|twoCst  , 
where |u1D6FF|u1D4JBCst|oneCst= |u1D447 |u1D438|u1D4JBCst⁄ and |u1D6FF|u1D461Cst|oneCst= |u1D446 |u1D438|u1D461Cst⁄ are the single-mode yield initiation displacements  and 
|u1D6FD = ∆|u1D461Cst∆|u1D4JBCst⁄ is the mixed-mode ratio.  As an analog to the yiel d initiation, the damage 
initiation displacement |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|twoCst is deﬁned as: 
|u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|twoCst= |u1D6FF|u1D4JBCst|twoCst|u1D6FF|u1D461Cst|twoCst/radical.v61 + |u1D6FD|twoCst
|u1D6FF|u1D461Cst|twoCst|twoCst+ |parenleftCv1|u1D6FD|u1D6FF|u1D4JBCst|twoCst|parenriµhtCv1|twoCst  , 
where 
|u1D6FF|u1D4JBCst|twoCst= |u1D6FF|u1D4JBCst|oneCst+|u1D4J3/u1D4:A.st|oneCst|u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:6.st

|u1D446 
As an alternative, a maximum nominal stress criteri on could be used (INICRT = 1)

A third possibility is to choose INICRT < 0, which invokes a nominal stress criterion 
with ﬂexible exponent: 
|u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|oneCst= |u1D6FF|u1D4JBCst|oneCst|u1D6FF|u1D461Cst|oneCst/radical.v21 + |u1D6FD|twoCst|parenleftCv3|u1D6FF|u1D461Cst|oneCst|/∆.st/N.st /∆.st/C.st/R.st/ε.st |+ |parenleftCv1|u1D6FD|u1D6FF|u1D4JBCst|oneCst|parenriµhtCv1|/∆.st/N.st /∆.st/C.st/R.st/ε.st ||parenriµhtCv3−|oneCst/|/∆.st/N.st /∆.st/C.st/R.st/ε.st |

Obviously, the special case of INICRT = -2 would le ad to the same result as the 
quadratic criterion, INICRT = 0. 
With |u1D6F∆ = arccos |parenleftCv3⟨|u1D462Cst/u1D45B.sts⟩
/Delt∙.st/u1D45A.sts|parenriµhtCv3, the ultimate (failure) displacement |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst /u1D45:.st can be written, 
|u1D6FF|u1D4JACst /u1D45:.st=|u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|oneCst(|u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|oneCst− |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|twoCst)|u1D438|u1D4JBCst|u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:6.st cos|twoCst|u1D6F∆ + |u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:6.st |parenleftCv22|u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:6.st + |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|oneCst(|u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|oneCst− |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|twoCst)|u1D438|u1D461Cstsin|twoCst|u1D6F∆|parenriµhtCv2
|u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|oneCst|parenleftCv1|u1D438|u1D4JBCst|u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:6.st cos|twoCst|u1D6F∆ + |u1D438|u1D461Cst|u1D43A/u1D4:C.st/u1D4:6.st sin|twoCst|u1D6F∆|parenriµhtCv1  . 
This formulation describes a power-law damage evolu tion with an exponent |u1D7≠2 = 1.0  
(see *MAT_138). 
 
After the shape of the mixed-mode traction-separati on law has been determined by |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|oneCst, 
|u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|twoCst, and |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst /u1D45:.st, the plastic separation in each element direction,  |u1D462|u1D4JBCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D443Cst, |u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D443Cst, and |u1D462|u1D461Cst|twoCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D443Cst can be 
calculated.  The plastic separation in peel directi on is given by 
|u1D462|u1D4JBCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D443Cst= max|parenleftCv1|u1D462|u1D4JBCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D443Cst/co⋯⋯a.st/Delt∙.st|u1D461Cst−|oneCst, |u1D462|u1D4JBCst− |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|oneCstcos(|u1D6F∆) , 0|parenriµhtCv1 . 
In the shear direction, a shear yield separation |u1D6FF|u1D461Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D466Cst,  
|u1D6FF|u1D461Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D466Cst=/radical.v2(|u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst− |u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D443Cst/co⋯⋯a.st/Delt∙.st|u1D461Cst−|oneCst)|twoCst+ (|u1D462|u1D461Cst|twoCst− |u1D462|u1D461Cst|twoCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D443Cst/co⋯⋯a.st/Delt∙.st|u1D461Cst−|oneCst)|twoCst, 
is deﬁned.  If |u1D6FF|u1D461Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D466Cst> |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|oneCstsin|u1D6F∆ , the plastic shear separations in the element coor dinate 
system are updated, 
|u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D443Cst= |u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D443Cst/co⋯⋯a.st/Delt∙.st|u1D461Cst−|oneCst+ |u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst− |u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst/co⋯⋯a.st/Delt∙.st|u1D461Cst−|oneCst

In the formulas above, ∆|u1D461 − 1  indicates the individual value from the last time 
increment.  In case ∆|u1D4JACst> |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|twoCst, the damage initiation criterion is satisﬁed, and a damage 
variable D increases monotonically, 
|u1D437 = max |parenleftCv6∆|u1D4JACst− |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|twoCst
|u1D6FF|u1D4JACst /u1D45:.st− |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst|twoCst, |u1D437/Delt∙.st|u1D461Cst−|oneCst, 0|parenriµhtCv6  . *MAT_COHESIVE_MIXED_MODE_ELASTOPLASTIC_RATE  *MAT_240  
 When ∆|u1D4JACst> |u1D6FF|u1D4JACst /u1D45:.st, complete damage ( |u1D437 = 1 ) is reached and the element fails in the 
corresponding integration point. 
 
Finally, the peel and the shear stresses in element  directions are calculated, 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D461Cst|oneCst= |u1D438|u1D461Cst(1 − |u1D437)|parenleftCv1|u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst− |u1D462|u1D461Cst|oneCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D443Cst|parenriµhtCv1
|u1D7≠∆|u1D461Cst|twoCst= |u1D438|u1D461Cst(1 − |u1D437)(|u1D462|u1D461Cst|twoCst− |u1D462|u1D461Cst|twoCst|u1D443Cst) 
In the peel direction, no damage under pressure loa ds is considered if |u1D462|u1D4JBCst− |u1D462|u1D4JBCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D443Cst> 0 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst= |u1D438|u1D4JBCst|parenleftCv1|u1D462|u1D4JBCst− |u1D462|u1D4JBCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D443Cst|parenriµhtCv1  . 
Otherwise, 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4JBCst= |u1D438|u1D4JBCst(1 − |u1D437)|parenleftCv1|u1D462|u1D4JBCst− |u1D462|u1D4JBCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D443Cst|parenriµhtCv1  . 
If the FUNCTIONS keyword option is used, parameters  EMOD, GMOD, G1C_0, G2C_-
0, T0, S0, FG1, and FG2 (as well as GMOD3, G3C_0, R 0, and FG3 if combined with 
3MODES) should refer to *DEFINE_FUNCTION IDs.  The arguments of those functions 
include several properties of both connection partn ers if corresponding solid elements 
are in a tied contact with shell elements. 
These functions depend on: 
(t1, t2) = thic k nesses of b oth b ond partners 
|parenleftCv1sy1, sy2|parenriµhtCv1 = initial yield stresses at plastic strain  of 0.002 
(sm1, sm2) = maximum engineering yield stresses (nec k ing points) 
r = strain rate 
a = element area 
For T0 = -100 such a function could look like: 
*DEFINE_FUNCTION 
        100 
 func(t1,t2,sy1,sy2,sm1,sm2,r,a)=0.5*(sy1+sy2 ) 
Since material parameters must be identiﬁed from bo th bond partners during 
initialization, this feature is only available for a subset of material models at the 
moment, namely material models 24, 36, 120, 123, 12 4, 251, and 258.

with anisotropic materials under plane stress condi tions.  This material allows the use 
of the Lankford parameters for the deﬁnition of the  anisotropy.  All features of this

Remarks: 
1.  The eﬀective plastic strain used in this model is deﬁned to be plastic work 
equivalent.  A consequence of this is that for para meters deﬁned as functions of 
eﬀective plastic strain, the rolling (00) direction  should be used as reference 
direction.  For instance, the hardening curve for H R = 3 is the stress as function *MAT_HILL_90  *MAT_243  
 of strain for uniaxial tension in the rolling direc tion, VLCID curve should give 
the relative volume change as function of strain fo r uniaxial tension in the roll- 
ing direction and load curve given by -E should giv e the Young’s modulus as 
function of strain for uniaxial tension in the roll ing direction.  Optionally the 
curve can be substituted for a table deﬁning harden ing as function of plastic 
strain rate (HR = 3) or temperature (HR = 8). 
2.  Exceptions from the rule above are curves deﬁned a s functions of plastic strain 
in the 45 and 90 directions, i.e., P1 and P2 for HR  = 7 and negative R45 or R90. 
The hardening curves are here deﬁned as measured st ress as function of meas- 
ured plastic strain for uniaxial tension in the dir ection of interest, i.e., as deter- 
mined from experimental testing using a standard pr ocedure.  Moreover, the 
curves deﬁning the R values are as function of the measured plastic strain for 
uniaxial tension in the direction of interest.  The se curves are transformed in- 
ternally to be used with the eﬀective stress and st rain properties in the actual 
model.  The eﬀective plastic strain does not coinci de with the plastic strain 
components in other directions than the rolling dir ection and may be some- 
what confusing to the user.  Therefore the von Mise s work equivalent plastic 
strain is output as history variable #2 if HR = 7 o r if any of the R-values is de- 
ﬁned as function of the plastic strain. 
3.  The R-values in curves are deﬁned as the ratio of instantaneous width change 
to instantaneous thickness change.  That is, assume  that the width W and 
thickness T are measured as function of strain.  Th en the corresponding R-
value is given by: 
|u1D44J =|u1D4J1 /u1D44A 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ //u1D44A
|u1D4J1|u1D447 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ /|u1D447 
4.  The anisotropic yield criterion Φ for plane stress is deﬁned as: 
Φ= |u1D43∆|oneCst|u1D4JACst+ |u1D43∆|threeCst|u1D43∆|twoCst(|u1D4JACst/|twoCst)−|oneCst+/u1D450|u1D4JACst|u1D43∆|fourCst|u1D4JACst/|twoCst= |parenleftCv11 +/u1D450|u1D4JACst− 2|u1D44∆ + |u1D44F|parenriµhtCv1|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st|u1D4JACst 
where |u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st is the yield stress and K i = 1,4  are given by: 
|u1D43∆|oneCst=|dividesCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|dividesCv2 
|u1D43∆|twoCst=|dividesCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst|twoCst+ |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst+ 2|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst|u1D466Cst |twoCst|dividesCv2 
|u1D43∆|threeCst= −2|u1D44∆|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst|twoCst− |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|twoCst|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D44F|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D46JCst− |u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenriµhtCv2|twoCst

If FLAG = 0, the anisotropic material constants a, b, and c are obtained through 
R00 , R 45 , and R 90  using these 3 equations: 
1 + 2|u1D44J|zeroCst|zeroCst =/u1D450|u1D4JACst− |u1D44∆ +{(|u1D4JA + 2)/2|u1D4JA}|u1D44F
1 − |u1D44∆ +{(|u1D4JA − 2)/2|u1D4JA}|u1D44F 
1 + 2|u1D44J|fourCst|fiveCst =/u1D450|u1D4JACst *MAT_243  *MAT_HILL_90  
 1 + 2|u1D44J/nine.st |zeroCst =/u1D450|u1D4JACst+ |u1D44∆ +{(|u1D4JA + 2)/2|u1D4JA}|u1D44F
1 + |u1D44∆ +{(|u1D4JA − 2)/2|u1D4JA}|u1D44F 
If FLAG = 1, material parameters a (AH), b (BH), an d c (CH) are used directly. 
For material parameters a, b, c, and m, the followi ng condition has to be ful- 
ﬁlled, otherwise an error termination occurs: 
1 +/u1D450|u1D4JACst− 2|u1D44∆ + |u1D44F   >    0 
Two even more strict conditions should ensure conve xity of the yield surface 
according to Hill (1990).  A warning message will b e dumped if at least one of 
them is violated: 
|u1D44F > −2|parenleftCv3|u1D4JACst
|twoCst|parenriµhtCv3−|oneCst/u1D450|u1D4JACst 
|u1D44F > |u1D44∆|twoCst−/u1D450|u1D4JACst 
The yield strength of the material can be expressed  in terms of k and n: 
|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st=/u1D458|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JBCst=/u1D458|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst + |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv2|u1D4JBCst 
where |u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst  is the elastic strain to yield and  |u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain (loga- 
rithmic).  If SIGY is set to zero, the strain to yi eld if found by solving for the 
intersection of the linearly elastic loading equati on with the strain hardening 
equation: 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D438|u1D7≠≠ 
|u1D7≠∆ =/u1D458|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JBCst 
which gives the elastic strain at yield as: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst = |parenleftCvJ|u1D438
/u1D458|parenriµhtCvJ|<racketleftCv4|oneCst
|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst|<racketriµhtCv4
 
If SIGY yield is nonzero and greater than 0.02 then : 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D466Cst|u1D4JDCst = |parenleftCv4|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st
/u1D458|parenriµhtCv4|<racketleftCv4|oneCst
|u1D4JBCst|<racketriµhtCv4
 
The other available hardening models include the Vo ce equation given by 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst |u1D4JDCsts, 
the Gosh equation given by 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst) =/u1D458(|u1D7≠≠|zeroCst+ |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst)|u1D4JBCst− |u1D4JD, 
and ﬁnally the Hocket-Sherby equation given by 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst |u1D4JDCsts/u1D45B.sts
. 
For the Gosh hardening law, the interpretation of t he variable SPI is the same, 
i.e., if set to zero the strain at yield is determi ned implicitly from the intersec- 
tion of the strain hardening equation with the line ar elastic equation. *MAT_HILL_90  *MAT_243  
 To include strain rate eﬀects in the model we multi ply the yield stress by a 
factor depending on the eﬀective plastic strain rat e.  We use the Cowper-
Symonds’ model, hence the yield stress can be writt en 
|u1D7≠∆/Y.st(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst) = |u1D7≠∆/Y.st|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst)
⎣⎢⎡1 + |parenleftCv6|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst
|u1D436|parenriµhtCv6|oneCst/|u1D4JDCst
⎦⎥⎤ 
where |u1D7≠∆/Y.st|u1D46≠Cst denotes the static yield stress, |u1D436 and |u1D4JD are material parameters, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst is 
the eﬀective plastic strain rate. 
5.  A kinematic hardening model is implemented followi ng the works of 
Chaboche and Roussilier.  A back stress α is introduced such that the eﬀective 
stress is computed as 
|u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st= |u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst − 2|u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst , |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst − 2|u1D6F+|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|oneCst , |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst − |u1D6F+|oneCst|twoCst ) 
The back stress is the sum of up to four terms acco rding to 
|u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |summationCv1 |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J8Cst|fourCst
|u1D4J8Cst=|oneCst 
and the evolution of each back stress component is as follows 
|u1D6FF|u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D4J8Cst= |u1D436|u1D4J8Cst|parenleftCvJ|u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst|u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst

where |u1D436|u1D4J8Cst and |u1D44∆|u1D4J8Cst are material parameters, |u1D46≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  is the deviatoric stress tensor, |u1D7≠∆|eCst /f.st/f.st is 
the eﬀective stress and |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst is the eﬀective plastic strain. *MAT_244  *MAT_UHS_STEEL

This is Material Type 244. This material model is d eveloped for both shell and solid 
models.  It is mainly suited for hot stamping proce sses where phase transformations are 
crucial.  It has ﬁve phases, and it is assumed that  the blank is fully austenitized before 
cooling.  The model also includes optional algorith ms for switching between heating 
and cooling.  The basic constitutive model is based  on the work done by P. Akerstrom 
[2, 7].  
NOTE 1:  For this material “weight%” means “ppm × 10 -4”. 
 
NOTE 2:  We include baseline values in the variable tables 
as possible starting values that lead to reasonable  
results for an alloy called 22MnB5. The values 
are taken from the literature.

/u1D44Ḃ|u1D4J8Cst= |u1D4J4|u1D4J8Cst(|u1D43A, |u1D436, |u1D447|u1D4J8Cst, |u1D444|u1D4J8Cst)|u1D4J3|u1D4J8Cst(/u1D44B|u1D4J8Cst)  ,/u1D458= 2,3,4 
where |u1D4J4|u1D4J8Cst is a function, taken from Li et al., dependent on the grain number |u1D43A, the 
chemical composition |u1D436, the temperature |u1D447, and the activation energy |u1D444.  Moreover, the 
function |u1D4J3|u1D4J8Cst is dependent on the actual phase /u1D44B|u1D4J8Cst= |u1D46J|u1D4J8Cst/|u1D46Je q  
|u1D4J3|u1D4J8Cst(/u1D44B|u1D4J8Cst) =/u1D44B|u1D4J8Cst|zeroCst/period.st|fourCst(/u1D44B.st|u1D4J8Csts−|oneCst)(1 −/u1D44B|u1D4J8Cst)|zeroCst/period.st|fourCst/u1D44B.st|u1D4J8Csts  ,/u1D458= 2,3,4 
The true amount of martensite, that is, /u1D458= 5, is modelled by using the true amount of 
the austenite left after the bainite phase: 
|u1D46J|fiveCst= |u1D46J|oneCst/˙racketleft.v21 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FC.st(MS−|u1D447Cst)/˙racketright.v2  , 
where |u1D46J|oneCst is the true amount of austenite left for the react ion, |u1D6F+ is a material dependent 
constant and MS is the start temperature of the mar tensite reaction.

The automatic start temperatures are printed to the  messag  ﬁle and if they are not 
accurate enough you can manually set them in the in put deck (must be set in absolute 
temperature, Kelvin).  If HEAT > 0, the temperature  FSnc (ferrite without C) is also 
echoed.  If the specimen exceeds that temperature, all remaining ferrite is instantane- 
ously transformed to austenite. 
Remarks: 
1.  History Variables.   History variables 1 through 8 include the diﬀeren t phases, 
the Vickers hardness, the yield stress and the ASTM  grain size number.  Set 
NEIPS = 8 (shells) or NEIPH = 8 (solids) on *DATABA SE_EXTENT_BINARY.

8 ASTM grain size number (a low 
value means large grains and vice 
versa) 
2.  Excluding Phases.   To exclude a phase from the simulation, set the P HASE 
parameter accordingly. 
3.  STRC and STRP.   Note that both strain rate parameters must be set  to include 
the eﬀect.  It is possible to use a temperature dep endent load curve for both 
parameters simultaneously or for one parameter keep ing the other constant. 
4.  TUNIT.   TUNIT is time units per hour and is only used for  calculating the 
Vicker Hardness.  By default, it is assumed that th e time unit is seconds.  If 
another time unit is used, for example milliseconds , then TUNIT must be 
changed to TUNIT = 3.6 × 10 |sixCst 
5.  TSF.   The thermal speedup factor TSF of *CONTROL_THERMA L_SOLVER is 
used to scale reaction kinetics and hardness calcul ations in this material model.  
Strain rate dependent properties (see LCY1 to LCY5 or STRC/STRP), however, 
are not scaled by TSF. 
6.  CRSH.   With the CRSH = 1 option it is now possible to tr ansfer the material 
properties from a hot stamping simulation (CRSH = 0 ) into another simulation.  
The CRSH = 1 option reads a dynain  ﬁle from a simulation with CRSH = 0 and 
keeps all the history variables (austenite, ferrite , pearlite, bainite, martensite, 
etc.) constant.  This will allow steels with inhomo geneous strength to be ana- 
lyzed in, for example, a crash simulation.  The spe ed with the CRSH = 1 option 
is comparable with *MAT_024. Note that for keeping the speed the tempera- 
ture used in the CRSH simulation should be constant  and the thermal solver 
should be inactive.  
7.  Heating and Cooling and Transformation Temperatures .  To activate the 
heating algorithm, set HEAT = 1 or 2. HEAT = 0 (def ault) activates only the 
cooling algorithm.  Note that for HEAT = 0 you must  check that the initial tem- 
perature of this material is above the start temper ature for the ferrite transfor- 
mation.  The transformation temperatures are echoed  in the messag  and d3hsp  
ﬁles.  
If HEAT > 0 the temperature that instantaneously tr ansforms all ferrite back to 
austenite is also echoed in the messag  ﬁle.  If you want to heat up to 100% 
austenite, you must let the specimen’s temperature exceed that temperature. *MAT_UHS_STEEL  *MAT_244  
 8.  HEAT, Grain Growth, and Re-austenization.   When HEAT is activated the 
re-austenitization and grain growth algorithms are also activated.  The grain 
growth is activated when the temperature exceeds a threshold value that is 
given by  
|u1D447 =|u1D43J
|u1D434 − log |oneCst|zeroCst |<racketleftCv1(GRCM)|u1D44∆Cst(GRCC)|u1D44FCst|<racketriµhtCv1  , 
and the rate equation for the grain growth is, 
|u1D4J4̇=/u1D458
2|u1D4J4|u1D4J2−|u1D444Cst
|u1D44JCst|u1D447Cst   . 
The rate equation for the phase re-austenitization is given in Oddy (1996) and 
is here mirrored 
|u1D46J̇|u1D44∆Cst= |u1D4JB|<racketleftCvJln |parenleftCvJ|u1D46J|u1D4J2Cst|u1D462Cst

|u1D4JBCst|<racketleftCvJ|u1D46J|u1D4J2Cst|u1D462Cst − |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst
/u1D̅0F(|u1D447)|<racketriµhtCvJ  , 
where |u1D4JB is the parameter HEATN.  The temperature dependent  function /u1D̅0F(|u1D447) 
is given from Oddy as /u1D̅0F(|u1D447) =/u1D450|oneCst(|u1D447 − |u1D447|u1D46≠Cst)|u1D4J≠Cst|twoCsts. The empirical parameters /u1D450|oneCst and /u1D450|twoCst 
are calibrated in Oddy to 2.06 × 10 /eight.st and 4.806 respectively.  Note that /u1D̅0F above 
given in seconds .

9.  Using the Table Capability for Temperature Dependen ce of Young’s 
Modulus.   Use *DEFINE_TABLE_2D and set the abscissa value e qual to 1 for 
the austenite YM-curve, equal to 2 for the ferrite YM-curve, equal to 3 for the 
pearlite YM curve, equal to 4 for the bainite YM-cu rve and ﬁnally equal to 5 for *MAT_244  *MAT_UHS_STEEL  
 the martensite YM-curve.  If you use the PHASE opti on you only need to de- 
ﬁne the curves for the included phases, but you can  deﬁne all ﬁve.  LS-DYNA 
uses the number 1 - 5 to get the right curve for th e right phase.  The total YM is 
calculated by a linear mixture law: Y M =Y M1 × P H ASE1 +⋯+Y M5 ×
P H ASE5 .  For example: 
*DEFINE_TABLE_2D 
$ The number before curve id:s define which phase t he curve 
$ will be applied to.  1 = Austenite, 2 = Ferrite, 3 = Pearlite, 
$ 4 = Bainite and 5 = Martensite.

                 5.0                 500 
$ 
$ Define curves 100 - 500

              1300.0              50.E+3 
               223.0             210.E+3 
10.  Using the Table Capability for Latent Heat.   When using a table ID for the 
latent heat (LAT1) you can describe all phase trans ition individually.  Use *DE-
FINE_TABLE_2D and set the abscissa values to the co rresponding phase tran- 
sition number, that is, 2 for austenite to ferrite,  3 for austenite to pearlite, 4 for 
austenite to bainite and 5 for austenite to martens ite.  Remark 9  demonstrates 
the form of a correct table deﬁnition.  If a curve is missing, the corresponding 
latent heat for that transition will be set to zero .  Also, when a table is used the 
LAT5 is ignored.  If HEAT > 0, you also have the op tion to include latent heat 
for the transition back to Austenite.  This latent heat curve is marked as 1 in the 
table deﬁnition of LAT1. 
11.  Using the Table Capability for Thermal Expansion.  When using a table ID 
for the thermal expansion you can specify the expan sion characteristics for 
each phase.  That is, you can have a curve for each  of the 5 phases (austenite, 
ferrite, pearlite, bainite, and martensite).  The i nput is identical to the above 
table deﬁnitions.  The table must have the abscissa  values between 1 and 5 
where the number correspond to phase 1 to 5. To exc lude one phase from in- 
ﬂuencing the thermal expansion you simply input a c urve that is zero for that 
phase or even easier, exclude that phase number in the table deﬁnition.  For 
example, to exclude the bainite phase you only deﬁn e the table with curves for 
the indices 1, 2, 3 and 5. 
12.  TEMPER.   Tempering is activated by setting TEMPER to 1.  W hen active, the 
default hardness calculation for bainite and marten site is altered to use an in- 
cremental update formula.  The total hardness is gi ven by ∑HV |u1D4J6× |u1D46J |u1D4J65
|u1D4J6=1. When 
holding phases are detected, the hardness for Baini te and Martensite is updat- 
ed according to *MAT_UHS_STEEL  *MAT_244  
 HV |fourCst|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst=|u1D46J|fourCst|u1D4JBCst
|u1D46J|fourCst|u1D4JBCst+|oneCstHV |fourCst|u1D4JBCst+∆|u1D46J|fourCst
|u1D46J|fourCst|u1D4JBCst+|oneCstℎ|fourCst(|u1D447),∆|u1D46J|fourCst= |u1D46J|fourCst|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst− |u1D46J|fourCst|u1D4JBCst
HV |fiveCst|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst=|u1D46J|fiveCst|u1D4JBCst

We detect the holding phase for Bainite and Martens ite when the temperature 
is in the appropriate range and if average temperat ure rate is below DTCRIT. 
The average temperature rate is calculated as |u1D447tresh |u1D461tresh ⁄ , where |u1D447tresh |u1D4JB+1= |u1D447tresh |u1D4JB+
|dividesCv2|u1D447̇|dividesCv2∆|u1D461 and |u1D461tresh |u1D4JB+1= |u1D461tresh |u1D4JB+∆|u1D461.  The average temperature and time are updated 
until |u1D461tresh ≥ |u1D461 samp . 
13.  CWM (Welding).   When computational welding mechanics is activated  with 
CWM = 1, the material can be deﬁned to be initially  in a quiet state.  In this 
state the material (often referred to as ghost mate rial) has thermo-mechanical 
properties deﬁned by an additional card.  The mater ial is activated when the 
temperature reaches the birth temperature.  See MAT _CWM (MAT_270) for a 
detailed description. 
14.  LCTRE (Transformation Induced Strains).   Transformation induced strains 
can be included with a load curve LCTRE as a functi on of temperature.  The 
load curve represents the diﬀerence between the har d phases and the austenite 
phase in the dilatometer curves.  Therefore, positi ve curve values result in a 
negative transformation strain for austenitization and a positive transfor- 
mation strain for the phase transformation from aus tenite to one of the hard 
phases.

 Remarks: 
1.  A layer of this material may be placed at a bounda ry of a bounded domain to 
simulate unboundedness of the domain at that bounda ry: the layer absorbs 
and attenuates waves propagating outward from the d omain, without any 
signiﬁcant reﬂection of the waves back into the bou nded domain.  The layer 
cannot support any static displacement.  
2.  It is assumed the material in the bounded domain n ear the layer is, or behaves 
like, a  linear ortho/anisotropic material.  The ma terial properties of the layer 
should be set to the corresponding properties of th is material.  
3.  The layer should form a cuboid box around the boun ded domain, with the 
axes of the box aligned with the coordinate axes.  Various faces of this box may 
be open, as required by the geometry of the problem , e.g., for a half-space 
problem, the “top” of the box should be open. 
4.  Internally, LS-DYNA will partition the entire PML into regions which form the 
“faces”, “edges” and “corners” of the above cuboid box, and generate a new 
material for each region.  This partitioning will b e visible in the d3plot ﬁle.  The 
user may safely ignore this partitioning. 
5.  The layer should have 5 - 10 elements through its depth.  Typically, 5 - 6 
elements are suﬃcient if the excitation source is r easonably distant from the 
layer, and 8 - 10 elements if it is close.  The siz e of the elements should be simi- 
lar to that of elements in the bounded domain near the layer, and should be 
small enough to suﬃciently discretize all signiﬁcan t wavelengths in the prob- 
lem. 
6.  The nodes on the outer boundary of the layer shoul d be fully constrained.  
7.  The stress and strain values reported by this mate rial do not have any physical 
signiﬁcance. *MAT_246  *MAT_PML_NULL  
 *MAT_PML_NULL  
This is  Material Type 246.  This is a perfectly-matched lay er (PML) material with a 
pressure ﬂuid constitutive law computed using an eq uation of state, to be used in a 
wave-absorbing layer adjacent to a ﬂuid material (* MAT_NULL with an EOS) in order 
to simulate wave propagation in an unbounded ﬂuid m edium.  Only *EOS_LINEAR_-
POLYNOMIAL and *EOS_GRUNEISEN are allowed with this  material.  See the 
Remarks section of *MAT_NULL (*MAT_009) for further  details.  Accurate results are 
to be expected only for the case where the EOS pres ents a linear relationship between 
the pressure and volumetric strain.  
This material is a variant of *MAT_PML_ELASTIC (*MA T_230) and is available only for 
solid 8-node bricks (element type 2).

Remarks: 
1.  Unboundedness.  A layer of this material may be placed at a boundar y of a 
bounded domain to simulate unboundedness of the dom ain at that boundary: 
the layer absorbs and attenuates waves propagating outward from the domain, 
without any signiﬁcant reﬂection of the waves back into the bounded domain.  
The layer cannot support any static displacement.  
2.  Material Properties of Bounded Domain.   It is assumed the material in the 
bounded domain near the layer is, or behaves like, a linear ﬂuid material.  The 
material properties of the layer should be set to t he corresponding properties 
of this material.  *MAT_PML_NULL  *MAT_246  
 3.  Layer Geometry.   The layer should form a cuboid box around the bou nded 
domain, with the axes of the box aligned with the c oordinate axes.  Various 
faces of this box may be open, as required by the g eometry of the problem.  For 
example, for a half-space problem, the “top” of the  box should be open. 
Internally, LS-DYNA will partition the entire PML i nto regions which form the 
“faces,” “edges” and “corners” of the above cuboid box and generate a new 
material for each region.  This partitioning will b e visible in the d3plot  ﬁle.  The 
user may safely ignore this partitioning. 
4.  Number of Elements in the Layer.   The layer should have 5 - 10 elements 
through its depth.  Typically, 5 - 6 elements are s uﬃcient if the excitation 
source is reasonably distant from the layer, and 8 - 10 elements if it is close.  
The size of the elements should be similar to that of elements in the bounded 
domain near the layer, and should be small enough t o suﬃciently discretize all 
signiﬁcant wavelengths in the problem. 
5.  Nodal Constraints.  The nodes on the outer boundary of the layer should  be 
fully constrained.  
6.  Stress and Strain.   The stress and strain values reported by this mat erial do 
not have any physical signiﬁcance. *MAT_248  *MAT_PHS_BMW  
 *MAT_PHS_BMW  
This is Material Type 248. This model is intended f or hot stamping processes with phase 
transformation eﬀects.  It is available for shell e lements only  and is based on Material 
Type 244 (*MAT_UHS_STEEL) . As compared with Material Type 244, Material Type  
248 features: 
1.  a more ﬂexible choice of evolution parameters, 
2.  an approach for transformation induced strains, 
3.  and a more accurate density calculation of individ ual phases. 
Thus, the physical eﬀects of the metal can be taken  into account calculating the volume 
fractions of ferrite, pearlite, bainite and martens ite for fast supercooling as well as for 
slow cooling conditions.  Furthermore, this materia l model features cooling-rate 
dependence for several of its more crucial material  parameters in order to accurately 
calculate the Time-Temperature-Transformation diagr am dynamically.  A detailed 
description can be found in Hippchen et al.  [2013]  and Hippchen [2014]. 
NOTE 1:  For this material “weight%” means “ppm × 10 -4”. 
 
NOTE 2:  For this material the phase fractions are calculat-
ed in volume percent (vol%). 
 
NOTE 3:  The baseline values for this material are mainly 
taken from those for *MAT_244. They are pro- 
vided to give reasonable starting results.  These 
values may not reproduce the results from the 
papers by Hippchen.

5.  Choosing/Excluding Phases.   To exclude a phase from the simulation, set the 
PHASE parameter accordingly. 
6.  Strain Rate Effects.   Note that both strain rate parameters (STRC and S TRP) 
must be set to include the eﬀect.  It is possible t o use a temperature dependent 
load curve for both parameters simultaneously or fo r one parameter keeping 
the other constant. 
7.  Time Units.   TUNIT is time units per hour and is only used for  calculating the 
Vicker Hardness.  By default, it is assumed that th e time unit is seconds.  If 
another time unit is used, for example milliseconds , then TUNIT must be 
changed to TUNIT = 3.6 × 10 6. 
8.  Thermal Speedup Factor.   The thermal speedup factor TSF of *CONTROL_-
THERMAL_SOLVER is used to scale reaction kinetics a nd hardness calcula- 
tions in this material model.  Strain rate dependen t properties (see LCY1 to 
LCY5 or STRC/STRP), however, are not scaled by TSF.  
9.  Re-Austenization and Grain Growth with the HEAT Fie ld.   When HEAT is 
activated, the re-austenitization and grain growth algorithms are also activat- 
ed.  See Remark 8  of MAT_244 for details. 
10.  Phase Indexed Tables.   When using a table ID to describe the Young’s 
modulus as dependent on the temperature, use *DEFIN E_TABLE_2D.  Set the 
abscissa value equal to 1 for the austenite YM-curv e, equal to 2 for the ferrite 
YM-curve, equal to 3 for the pearlite YM curve, equ al to 4 for the bainite YM-
curve and ﬁnally equal to 5 for the martensite YM-c urve.  When using the 
PHASE option only the curves for the included phase s are required, but all ﬁve 
phases may be included.  The total YM is calculated  by a linear mixture law:  
Y M =Y M1 × P H ASE1 +⋯+Y M5 × P H ASE5 
For example: 
*DEFINE_TABLE_2D 
$ The number before curve id:s define which phase t he curve 
$ will be applied to.  1 = Austenite, 2 = Ferrite, 3 = Pearlite, 
$ 4 = Bainite and 5 = Martensite.

11.  Phase-indexed Latent Heat Table.   A table ID may be speciﬁed for the Latent 
heat (LAT1) to describe each phase change individua lly.  Use *DEFINE_TA-
BLE_2D and set the abscissa values to the correspon ding phase transition 
number.  That is, 2 for the Austenite – Ferrite, 3 for the Austenite – Pearlite, 4 
for the Austenite – Bainite and 5 for the Austenite  – Martensite.  See Remark 10  
for an example of a correct table deﬁnition.  If a curve is missing, the corre- 
sponding latent heat for that transition will be se t to zero.  Also, when a table is 
used, LAT2 is ignored.  If HEAT > 0, the latent for  the transition back to Aus- 
tenite can also be included.  This latent heat curv e is marked as 1 in the table 
deﬁnition of LAT1. 
12.  Phase-indexed Thermal Expansion Table.   Tables are supported for deﬁning 
diﬀerent thermal expansion properties for each phas e.  The input is identical to 
the above table deﬁnitions.  The table must have th e abscissa values between 1 
and 5 where the number correspond to phase 1 to 5. To exclude one phase 
from inﬂuencing the thermal expansion you simply in put a curve that is zero 
for that phase or even easier, exclude that phase n umber in the table deﬁnition.  
For example, to exclude the bainite phase you only deﬁne the table with curves 
for the indices 1, 2, 3 and 5. 
13.  Phase-indexed Transformation Induced Strain Propert ies.   Transformation 
induced strains can be deﬁne with a table TABRHO, w here densities are de- 
ﬁned as functions of phase (table abscissas) and te mperature (load curves). *MAT_249  *MAT_REINFORCED_THERMOPLASTIC

This is Material Type 249. This material model desc ribes a reinforced thermoplastic 
composite material.  The reinforcement is deﬁned as  an anisotropic hyper-elastic 
material with up to three distinct ﬁber directions.   It can be used to model unidirection- 
al layers as well as woven and non-crimped fabrics.   The matrix is modeled with a 
simple thermal elasto-plastic material formulation.   For a composite, the overall stress is 
found by adding the ﬁber and matrix stresses.

GE.1: Use *INITIAL_STRESS_ SHELL to initialize some 
material properties on an element-by- element basis (see 
Remark 3  below). 
Remarks: 
1.  Stress Calculation.   This material features an additive split of the m atrix and 
reinforcement contributions to the stress.  Therefo re, the combined stress re- 
sponse, /u1D̅48, equals the sum  /u1D̅48|u1D4JACst+/u1D̅48/u1D45:.st. 
The matrix model uses an elastic-plastic material f ormulation with a von-Mises 
yield criterion.  Material parameters, such as Youn g’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio 
and yield stress, can be given as functions of temp erature.  This material sup- 
ports a mixed hardening approach. 
We formulated the contribution of the ﬁber reinforc ement as a hyperelastic 
material.  Based on the orientation angle, |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst, of the ith  ﬁber family, LS-DYNA 
computes an initial ﬁber direction in the element c oordinate system /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst. By 
using the deformation gradient, /u1D405, the current ﬁber conﬁguration is given as 
/u1D426|iCst=/u1D405 /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst, containing all necessary information on ﬁber stra in and reorienta- 
tion.  Here, this vector is always orthogonal to th e shell normal and can, thus, 
be represented by the two in-plane vector component s. 
Following standard textbook mechanics for anisotrop ic and hyperelastic mate- 
rials, the elastic stresses within the ﬁbers due to  tension or compression are 
given as  *MAT_249  *MAT_REINFORCED_THERMOPLASTIC  
 /u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/u1D45:.st= |summationCv1/u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst)|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst= |summationCv11
/u1D4:D|u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst)(/u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst)|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  , 
where the function |u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst of the ﬁber strain |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst corresponds to the load curve LCEF i. 
|u1D4JB is the number of ﬁber families. 
The shear behavior of the reinforcement can be cont rolled by METH ij.  For val- 
ues less than 10, the behavior is again standard te xtbook mechanics: 
/u1D̅48/u1D446.st/u1D45:.st= |summationCv1/u1D̅48/u1D446.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst/u1D45:.st|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst= |summationCv11
/u1D4:D|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst(/u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst)(/u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst+|oneCst)|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
Here /u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst represents the employed shear measure (scalar prod uct or shear 
angle in radians).  In general, the dyadic product /u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst+|oneCst does not deﬁne a 
shear stress tensor.  This formulation might result  in unphysical shear behavior 
in the case of woven fabrics.  Therefore, we devise d METH ij  = 10 and 11 to 
always give a pure shear stress tensor, /u1D̅48/u1D446.st/u1D45:.st.  
For even values of METH ij,  an elastic shear response is assumed.  If deﬁned, 
the load curve LCG ij corresponds to function |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J7Cst. In this case the values of G ij, 
ALOC ij  and GLOC ij are ignored. 
For odd values of METH ij  on the other hand, an elasto-plastic shear behavio r is 
assumed and the load curve LCG ij deﬁnes the yield stress value as function of 
a normalized shear parameter.  This implies that th e load curve needs to be 
deﬁned for abscissa values between 0.0 and 1.0. A ﬁ rst elastic regime, which is 
controlled by the linear shear stiﬀness G ij , is assumed until the yield stress 
given in the load curve for normalized shear value 0.0 is reached.  A second 
linear elastic regime is deﬁned for shear angles ( /u1D̅0∫|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst )/ ﬁber angles ( |u1D7≠2|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst ) larger 
than the locking angle ALOC ij . The corresponding stiﬀness in that regime is 
GLOC ij.  At the transition point to the second elastic regi me, the shear stress 
corresponds to the load curve value for a normalize d shear of 1.0. 
2.  History Data.   This material formulation outputs to d3plot  additional data for

The above table also shows the order of output as w ell as the number of extra 
history variables associated with the particular ﬂa g.  In total NXH extra varia- 
bles are required depending on the choice of parame ter POSTV. For example, 
the maximum number of additional variables is NXH =  32 for POSTV = 127. 
As mentioned in Remark 1  ﬁber orientation is represented in the material su b- 
routine as vector /u1D426|iCst deﬁned in the element coordinate system.  Prior to  writing 
to the list of histories the vector is transformed into the global coordinate sys- 
tem with three vector components for |u1D44∆|fourCst= 1 and/or into the overall material 
coordinate system with two vector components for |u1D44∆|sevenCst= 1. 
A more complete list of potentially helpful history  variables is given in the

3.  Description of IHIS.   Some material data can be initialized on an element -by-
element basis through history variables deﬁned with  *INITIAL_STRESS_-
SHELL starting at position HISV5.   
How the data is interpreted depends on the paramete r IHIS. Following the 
same concept as for parameter POSTV, the value of I HIS is computed by the 
following expression: 
I H IS = |u1D44∆|oneCst+ 2 |u1D44∆|twoCst 
Each ﬂag  |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary number (can be either 1 or 0) and corr esponds to one 
particular type of material variable.  So far, the only material variables imple- 
mented are ﬁber orientation in two diﬀerent coordin ate systems, global and 
material.  Thus, at most one of the ﬂags |u1D44∆|oneCst and |u1D44∆|twoCst should be set to 1.

This is Material Type 249. This material model desc ribes a reinforced thermoplastic 
composite material with its damage and failure beha vior.  The reinforcement is 
modeled as an anisotropic hyper-elastic material wi th up to three distinguished ﬁber 
directions.  It can be used to model unidirectional  layers as well as woven and non-
crimped fabrics.  The matrix is modeled with a simp le elastic plastic material 
formulation.  For a composite, the overall stress i s found by adding the ﬁber and matrix 
stresses.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
GE.1:  Use *INITIAL_STRESS_ SHELL to initialize some 
material properties on an element-by-ele ment basis (see 
Remark 5  below). 
Remarks: 
1.  Stress Calculation.   This material features an additive split of the m atrix and 
reinforcement contributions to the stress.  Therefo re, the combined stress re- 
sponse, /u1D̅48, equals the sum  /u1D̅48|u1D4JACst+/u1D̅48/u1D45:.st. 
The matrix uses an elastic-plastic material formula tion with a von-Mises yield 
criterion.  This material supports a mixed hardenin g approach. 
We formulated the contribution of the ﬁber reinforc ement as a hyperelastic 
material.  Based on the orientation angle, |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst, of the ith  ﬁber family, LS-DYNA 
computes an initial ﬁber direction in the element c oordinate system /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst. By 
using the deformation gradient, /u1D405, the current ﬁber conﬁguration is given as 
/u1D426|iCst=/u1D405 /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst, containing all necessary information on ﬁber stra in and reorienta- 
tion.  Here, this vector is always orthogonal to th e shell normal and can, thus, 
be represented by the two in-plane vector component s. 
Following standard textbook mechanics for anisotrop ic and hyperelastic mate- 
rials, the elastic stresses within the ﬁbers due to  tension or compression are 
given as  
/u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/u1D45:.st= |summationCv1/u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst)|u1D4JBCst

|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  , 
where the function |u1D4J3|u1D4J6Cst of the ﬁber strain |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst corresponds to the load curve LCEF i. 
|u1D4JB is the number of ﬁber families. 
The shear behavior of the reinforcement can be cont rolled by METH ij.  For val- 
ues less than 10, the behavior is again standard te xtbook mechanics: 
/u1D̅48/u1D446.st/u1D45:.st= |summationCv1/u1D̅48/u1D446.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst/u1D45:.st|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst= |summationCv11
/u1D4:D|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst(/u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst)(/u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst+|oneCst)|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
Here /u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst represents the employed shear measure (scalar prod uct or shear 
angle in radians).  In general, the dyadic product /u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst+|oneCst does not deﬁne a 
shear stress tensor.  This formulation might result  in unphysical shear behavior 
in the case of woven fabrics.  Therefore, we devise d METH ij  = 10 and 11 to 
always give a pure shear stress tensor, /u1D̅48/u1D446.st/u1D45:.st.  *MAT_249_CRASH  *MAT_REINFORCED_THERMOPLASTIC_CRASH  
 For even values of METH ij,  an elastic shear response is assumed.  If deﬁned, 
the load curve LCG ij corresponds to function |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J7Cst. In this case the values of G ij, 
ALOC ij  and GLOC ij are ignored. 
For odd values of METH ij  on the other hand, an elasto-plastic shear behavio r is 
assumed and the load curve LCG ij deﬁnes the yield stress value as function of 
a normalized shear parameter.  This implies that th e load curve needs to be 
deﬁned for abscissa values between 0.0 and 1.0. A ﬁ rst elastic regime, which is 
controlled by the linear shear stiﬀness G ij , is assumed until the yield stress 
given in the load curve for normalized shear value 0.0 is reached.  A second 
linear elastic regime is deﬁned for shear angles ( /u1D̅0∫|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst )/ ﬁber angles ( |u1D7≠2|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst ) larger 
than the locking angle ALOC ij . The corresponding stiﬀness in that regime is 
GLOC ij.  At the transition point to the second elastic regi me, the shear stress 
corresponds to the load curve value for a normalize d shear of 1.0. 
2.  Damage and Failure.   This material features a phenomenological descripti on 
of damage and failure.  User-deﬁned load curves spe cify several damage vari- 
ables as functions of the ﬁber strain values  |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst or shear /u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst. Here, damage 
parameters are always accumulated and cannot decrea se during the simula- 
tion. 
If input parameter DAF i refers to a load curve, it speciﬁes the damage par ame- 
ter |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st as function of the ﬁber strain |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst. If DAF i refers to a table, the material 
distinguishes between tensile and compressive damag e.  In that case, two pa- 
rameters |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D461Cst and |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J≠Cst are introduced as functions of the ﬁber strain |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst (given by 
two load curves referred to by the table deﬁnition)  and are both evaluated in 
every time step.  The eﬀective damager parameter |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st is then deﬁned as  
|u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst) =
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧|u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J≠Cst(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst), |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst< 0
|u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D461Cst(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst), |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst≥ 0 
The damage parameter |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st degrades the ﬁber stress contribution /u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st: 
/u1D̅48/circum⨂lexcmb.h1|u1D447Cst/u1D45:.st= |summationCv1 |parenleftCvJ/u1D̅CF− |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst)|parenriµhtCvJ/u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst)|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
Failure of the composite material at the integratio n point is initiated as soon as 
all ﬁbers have failed: min 
|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/u1D45:.st= 1.0 . 
We assume matrix damage to result from the ﬁber str aining and reorientating.  
Consequently, the input includes load curves DAM i and DAM ij  to specify 
damage parameters |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JACst(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst) and |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst|u1D4JACst|parenleftCv1/u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst|parenriµhtCv1, respectively.  The overall matrix 
damage parameter |u1D4J1|u1D4JACst is given by 
|u1D4J1|u1D4JACst= max |parenleftCv4max 
|u1D4J6Cst≤|u1D4JBCst|u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JACst(|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst), max 
|u1D4J6Cst<|u1D4JBCst|u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst|u1D4JACst|parenleftCv1/u1D̅05|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst|parenriµhtCv1|parenriµhtCv4  . *MAT_REINFORCED_THERMOPLASTIC_CRASH  *MAT_249_CRASH  
 Matrix failure ( |u1D4J1|u1D4JACst= 1.0 ) does not necessarily initiate failure of the comp osite 
material.  In this implementation, matrix damage pa rameters |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JACst and |u1D4J1|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst|u1D4JACst that 
exceed a value of 1.0 are admissible.  Failure of t he composite is initiated as 
soon as the damage parameter reaches 1.5. To accoun t for this delayed failure, 
the degradation of the matrix stresses is given by:  
/u1D̅48/circum⨂lexcmb.h1|u1D4JACst= |parenleftCv21 − min |parenleftCv11.0, |u1D4J1|u1D4JACst|parenriµhtCv1|parenriµhtCv2/u1D̅48|u1D4JACst  . 
3.  Fiber Viscosity.   Input parameter VISC activates ﬁber viscosity.  Thi s feature 
adds numerical damping to the post-damage behavior of the material.  Damp- 
ing might be necessary since brittle ﬁber failure t ends to induce shockwaves 
through the material, resulting in oscillations or even unphysical damage 
propagation.  
If activated, an additional viscous stress term is added to the ﬁber contribution: 
/u1D̅48|u1D447Cst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D463Cst/u1D45:.st= |summationCv11
/u1D4:D⎝⎜⎛/integral.v:|u1D4J3|u1D463Cst(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)|u1D71J|u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst(/u1D̅0F)

⎠⎟⎞(/u1D426|iCst⊗/u1D426|iCst)|u1D4JBCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
The relaxation function, |u1D4J3|u1D463Cst, is represented by up to four terms of the Prony 
series expansions and thus reads 
|u1D4J3|u1D463Cst(|u1D461) = |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J8Csts|u1D461Cst
|u1D4J8Cst 
with relaxation moduli |u1D43A|u1D4J8Cst and decay constants |u1D6FD|u1D4J8Cst. 
4.  History Data.   This material formulation outputs to d3plot  additional data for 
post-processing to the set of history variables if requested.  The parameter 
POSTV speciﬁes the data to be written.  Its value i s calculated as 
POST V = |u1D44∆|oneCst+ 2 |u1D44∆|twoCst+ 4 |u1D44∆|threeCst+8 |u1D44∆|fourCst+ 16 |u1D44∆|fiveCst+ 32 |u1D44∆|sixCst+ 64 |u1D44∆|sevenCst. 
Each ﬂag  |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary number (can be either 1 or 0) and corr esponds to one 
particular type of post-processing variable accordi ng to the following table.

The above table also shows the order of output as w ell as the number of extra 
history variables associated with the particular ﬂa g.  In total NXH extra varia- 
bles are required depending on the choice of parame ter POSTV. For example, 
the maximum number of additional variables is NXH =  32 for POSTV = 127. 
As mentioned in Remark 1  ﬁber orientation is represented in the material su b- 
routine as vector /u1D426|iCst deﬁned in the element coordinate system.  Prior to  writing 
to the list of histories the vector is transformed into the global coordinate sys- 
tem with three vector components for |u1D44∆|fourCst= 1 and/or into the overall  material 
coordinate system with two vector components for  |u1D44∆|sevenCst= 1. 
A more complete list of potentially helpful history  variables is given in the 
following table.  The variable NEIPS in *DATABASE_E XTENT_BINARY must 
be set to output these history variables.

 5.  Description of IHIS.   Some material data can be initialized on an element -by-
element basis through history variables deﬁned with  *INITIAL_STRESS_-
SHELL starting at position HISV5.   
How the data is interpreted depends on the paramete r IHIS. Following the 
same concept as for parameter POSTV, the value of I HIS is computed by the 
following expression: 
I H IS = |u1D44∆|oneCst+ 2 |u1D44∆|twoCst 
Each ﬂag  |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary number (can be either 1 or 0) and corr esponds to one 
particular type of material variable.  So far, the only material variables imple- 
mented are ﬁber orientation in two diﬀerent coordin ate systems, global and 
material.  Thus, at most one of the ﬂags |u1D44∆|oneCst and |u1D44∆|twoCst should be set to 1.

This is Material Type 249. It describes a material with unidirectional ﬁber reinforce- 
ments and considers up to three distinct ﬁber direc tions.  Each ﬁber family is described 
by a spatially transversely isotropic neo-Hookean c onstitutive law.  The implementation 
is based on an adapted version of the material desc ribed by Bonet and Burton  (1998). The 
material is only available for thin shell elements and in explicit simulations.

Stress Calculation: 
In this model up to three distinct ﬁber families ar e considered.  We assume that there is 
no interaction between the families.  Thus, the res ulting stress tensor is the sum of the 
single ﬁber responses.  Each ﬁber response is the s um of an isotropic and a spatially 
transversely isotropic neo-Hookean stress contribut ion, /u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cst|iCst|sCst /o.st  and /u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cst|tCst /r.st , respectively. The 
implementation is based on the work of Bonet and Bu rton (1998), adapted by BMW for 
simulation of unidirectional fabrics (see reference s below).  
 
The isotropic stress tensor, /u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cstiso , depends on an isotropic shear modulus, |u1D7≠7, and an 
isotropic bulk modulus, |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst where:  
|u1D7≠7 =|u1D438|iCst|sCst /o.st 
2(1 +/u1D̅08) and |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst=|u1D438|iCst|sCst /o.st (/u1D̅08+ |u1D4JB|u1D4J6Cst/u1D̅08|twoCst)
2(1 +/u1D̅08). 
Here, the variable |u1D4JB|u1D4J6Cst denotes the ratio between stiﬀness orthogonally to  the ﬁbers and in 
ﬁber direction, that is, |u1D4JB|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D438|iCst|sCst /o.st /|u1D438|u1D4J6Cst.  |u1D438iso , /u1D̅08, and |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst are input parameters.  Using the left 
Cauchy-Green tensor, /u1D41B, the isotropic neo-Hookean model reads: 
/u1D̅48|u1D4J6Cst|iCst|sCst /o.st =|u1D7≠7
/u1D4:D(/u1D41B−/u1D408) + |u1D7≠6|u1D4J6Cst(/u1D4:D− 1)/u1D408 . 
 
Based on the orientation angel |u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst of the ith  ﬁber family, an initial ﬁber direction /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst is 
computed.  The deformation gradient, /u1D405, transforms the initial ﬁber conﬁguration to the 
current ﬁber conﬁguration as /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst=/u1D405 /u1D426 |u1D4J6Cst|zeroCst. This vector contains all necessary information 
on ﬁber elongation and reorientation.

The parameter EZDEF activates a modiﬁcation of the model.  Instead of the standard 
deformation gradient, /u1D405, a modiﬁed tensor /u1D405̃ is employed to calculate current ﬁber 
directions /u1D426|u1D4J6Cst and left Cauchy-Green tensor /u1D41B. For tensor /u1D405̃ only the ﬁrst two rows of the 
deformation gradient are updated based on the defor mation of the element.  This 
simpliﬁcation can in some cases increase the stabil ity of the model, especially if the 
structure undergoes large deformations.

This is  Material Type 251.  It is similar to MAT_PIECEWISE_ LINEAR_PLASTICITY or 
*MAT_024 (see full description there).  Unlike *MAT _024, it has a 3D table option that 
uses a history variable (such as hardness and tempe rature) from a previous calculation 
to evaluate the plastic behavior as a function of 1 ) history variable, 2) strain rate, and 3) 
plastic strain.  Starting with release R12, it is a lso possible to use a 4D table option with 
two history variables, that is, the plastic behavio r would be a function of 1) history 
variable HISVN + 1, 2) history variable HISVN, 3) s train rate, and 4) plastic strain.  This 
material is available for shell and solid elements.

Load Curve.   When LC SS is a load curve ID, it is taken as 
deﬁning stress as a function of eﬀective plastic st rain.  If deﬁned, 
EPS1 - EPS8 and ES1 - ES8 are ignored.  
Tabular Data.   The table ID deﬁnes for each strain rate value a 
load curve ID giving the stress as a function eﬀect ive plastic strain 
for that rate; see Figure M24-1 .  When the strain rate falls below 
the minimum value, the stress as a function of eﬀec tive plastic 
strain curve for the lowest value of strain rate is  used.  Likewise, 
when the strain rate exceeds the maximum value the stress as a 
function of eﬀective pl astic strain curve for the highest value of *MAT_251  *MAT_TAILORED_PROPERTIES  
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
strain rate is used.  EPS1 - EPS8 and ES1 - ES8 are ignored if a 
table ID is deﬁned.  Linear interpolation between t he discrete 
strain rates is used by default. 
Logarithmically Deﬁned Tables.   Logarithmic int erpolation 
between discrete strain rates is assumed if the ﬁrst  value in the 
table is negative, in which case LS-DY NA assumes that all the 
table values represent the natural logarithm of a s train rate.  Since 
the tables are internally discretized to equa lly space the table 
values, it makes good sense from an accuracy standp oint that the 
table values represent the natural log of strain ra te when the 
lowest strain rate and highest strain rate diﬀer by  several orders 
of magnitude.  There is some additional computational cost 
associated with invoking logarithmic interpolation.   
Multi-Dimensional Tables.   Stress values can also be dependent 
upon history variables.  The 3D table gives stress versus plastic 
strain as a function of strain rates as a function of o ne history 
variable (see HISVN).  The 4D table gives stress ve rsus plastic 
strain as a function of strain rates as a function of two history 
variable values (see HISVN). 
VP Formulation for rate eﬀects: 
EQ.0.0: Scale yield stress (default) 
EQ.1.0: Viscoplastic formulation 
HISVN Location of the history variable in the histo ry array of *INITIAL_-
STRESS_SHELL/SOLID that is used to evaluate the 3D table LC-
SS. If a 4D table is used, then HISVN is the locati on of the history 
variable for the *TABLE_3D value, and HISVN + 1 is the location 
of the history variable for the *TABLE_4D values.  
PHASE Constant value to evaluate the 3D table LC SS. PHASE is only 
used if HISVN = 0. 
EPS1 - EPS8 Eﬀective plastic strain values (optiona l).  At least 2 points should 
be deﬁned.  The ﬁrst point must be zero correspondi ng to the 
initial yield stress. 
ES1 - ES8 Corresponding yield stress values to EPS1  - EPS8 *MAT_TAILORED_PROPERTIES  *MAT_251  
 Remarks: 
If the 3D or 4D table is used for LCSS, interpolati on is used to ﬁnd the corresponding 
stress value for the current plastic strain, strain  rate, and history variable(s).  In 
addition, extrapolation is used for the history var iable evaluation, which means that 
some upper and lower “limit curves” have to be used , if extrapolation is not desired. 
 
If material history is written to the dynain  ﬁle using *INTERFACE_SPRINGBACK_LS-
DYNA, the history variables of *MAT_251 (for exampl e, hardness and temperature) are 
written to positions HISV6 and HISV7 of *INITIAL_ST RESS_SHELL/SOLID. 
 
It is recommended to set HISVN = 6 and to put the h istory variables on position HISV6 
(and HISV7 if TABLE_4D is used) if *MAT_251 is used  in combination with *MAT_-

This is  Material Type 252, the Toughened Adhesive Polymer m odel (TAPO).  It is based 
on non-associated /u1D4:C|oneCst - /u1D4:D|twoCst plasticity constitutive equations and was speciﬁca lly developed 
to represent the mechanical behaviour of crash opti mized high-strength adhesives 
under combined shear and tensile loading.  This mod el includes material softening due 
to damage, rate-dependency, and a constitutive desc ription for the mechanical 
behaviour of bonded connections under compression. 
 
A detailed description of this material can be foun d in Matzenmiller and Burbulla 
[2013].  This material model can be used with solid  elements or with cohesive elements 
in combination with *MAT_ADD_COHESIVE.

LCSS Curve ID or Table ID 
Load Curve.  The curve speciﬁes yield stress /u1D̅0F/Y.st as a function of 
plastic strain |u1D4JF. 
Table Data.   If a 2D table is deﬁned, for each strain rate value  the 
table speciﬁes a curve ID giving the yield stress a s a function of 
plastic strain for that strain rate (see *DEFINE_TA BLE).  If a 3D 
table is deﬁned, for each temperature value, a tabl e ID is speciﬁed 
which, in turn, maps strain rates to curves giving the yield stress 
as a function of plastic strain (see DEFINE_TABLE_3 D). 
The yield stress as a function of plastic strain cu rve for the lowest 
value of strain rate or temperature is used when th e strain rate or 
temperature falls below the minimum value.  Likewis e, 
maximum values cannot be exceeded.  Hardening varia bles are 
ignored with this option (TAU0, Q, B, H, C, GAM0, a nd GAMM).

The yield functions |u1D4J3 and |u1D4J3̂ are formulated in terms of the eﬀective stress ten sor

and the isotropic material damage |u1D437 according to the continuum damage mechanics in

The plastic arc length |u1D6F∆̇|vCst characterizes the inelastic response of the materi al and is 
deﬁned by the Euclidean norm:

In addition, the arc length of the damage plastic s train rate |u1D4JḞ is introduced by means of 
the arc length |u1D6F∆̇|vCst and the continuity (1 − |u1D437) as in Lemaitre [1992], where /u1D4:C̃|oneCst=/u1D4:C|oneCst(1 − |u1D437) ⁄  
and  /u1D4:D̃|twoCst=/u1D4:D|twoCst(1 − |u1D437)|twoCst⁄  are the eﬀective stress invariants (see Figure M252-3 ).

The rate-dependent yield strength for shear /u1D̅0F/Y.st can be deﬁned by two alternative 
expressions.  The ﬁrst representation is an analyti c expression for /u1D̅0F/Y.st: 
/u1D̅0F/Y.st= (/u1D̅0F|zeroCst+ |u1D44J) |<racketleftCvJ1 + |u1D436 |parenleftCvJ/uni2ℜE8.β4ln |u1D6F∆̇

where the ﬁrst factor (/u1D̅0F|zeroCst+ |u1D44J)  in /u1D̅0F/Y.st is given by the static yield strength with the ini tial 
yield /u1D̅0F|zeroCst and the non-linear hardening contribution  Figure M252-3.   Accumulated plastic strain |u1D6F∆|vCst and damage plastic strain |u1D4JF as a 
function of strain |u1D6F∆ *MAT_TOUGHENED_ADHESIVE_POLYMER  *MAT_252  
 |u1D44J =/u1D45E|<racketleftCv11 − exp(−|u1D44F|u1D4JF)|<racketriµhtCv1 +/u1D4:B |u1D4JF  . 
The second factor […] in /u1D̅0F/Y.st describes the rate dependency of the yield strengt h by a 
modiﬁed Johnson & Cook approach with the reference strain rates |u1D6F∆̇|zeroCst and |u1D6F∆̇|mCst which 
limit the shear strength /u1D̅0F/Y.st (see Figure M252-4 ).  
 
The second representation of the yield strength /u1D̅0F/Y.st is the table deﬁnition LCSS, where 
hardening can be deﬁned as a function of plastic st rain, strain rate, and temperature. 
 
Toughened structural adhesives show distortional ha rdening under plastic ﬂow, that is, 
the yield surface changes its shape.  This formativ e hardening can be phenomenological 
described by simple evolution equations of paramete rs |u1D44∆|oneCst= |u1D44∆̂|oneCst(|u1D4JF)  ∧  |u1D44∆|twoCst= |u1D44∆̂|twoCst(|u1D4JF) in the 
yield criterions |u1D4J3 with the initial values |u1D44∆|oneCst|zeroCst  and |u1D44∆|twoCst|zeroCst : 
|u1D44∆|oneCst= |u1D44∆̂|oneCst(|u1D4JF)∧|u1D44∆̇|oneCst= |u1D44∆|oneCst/H.st|u1D4JḞ
|u1D44∆|twoCst= |u1D44∆̂|twoCst(|u1D4JF)∧|u1D44∆|twoCst≥ 0∧|u1D44∆̇|twoCst= |u1D44∆|twoCst/H.st|u1D4JḞ 
The parameters |u1D44∆|oneCst/H.st and |u1D44∆|twoCst/H.st can take positive or negative values as long as th e inequality 
|u1D44∆|twoCst≥ 0 is satisﬁed.  The criterion |u1D44∆|twoCst≥ 0 ensures an elliptic yield surface.  The yield 
criterion |u1D4J3̂ uses only the initial values |u1D44∆|oneCst= |u1D44∆|oneCst|zeroCst  and |u1D44∆|twoCst= |u1D44∆|twoCst|zeroCst  without the distortional 
hardening. 
 
The empirical isotropic damage model |u1D437 is based on the approach in Lemaitre [1985].  
Two diﬀerent evolution equations |u1D437/circum⨂lexcmb.h1̇(|u1D4JF, |u1D4JḞ) and |u1D437/c∙roncmb.h1̇(|u1D6F∆|vCst, |u1D6F∆̇|vCst) are available (see Fig-

 *MAT_GENERALIZED_PHASE_CHANGE 
This is Material Type 254. It is designed to model phase transformations in materials 
and the implied changes in the material properties.   It is applicable to hot stamping, 
heat treatment and welding processes for a wide ran ge of materials.  It accounts for up 
to 24 phases and provides a list of generic phase c hange mechanisms for each possible 
phase changes. The parameters for the phase transfo rmation laws are to be given in 
tabulated form. 
Given the current microstructure composition, the f ormulation implements a 
temperature and strain-rate dependent elastic-plast ic material with non-linear 
hardening behavior.  Above a certain temperature, t he model shows an ideal elastic-
plastic behavior with no evolution of plastic strai ns. 
The material has been implemented for solid and she ll elements and is suitable for 
explicit and implicit analysis.

 Remarks: 
1.  Phase Transformation Matrix.   All data deﬁning the microstructure evolution 
is expected to be given in a tabular form.  The inp ut is structured as a two-
dimensional matrix containing one row for any start ing phase and one row for 
any target phase.  The basic structure is depicted in the following table:  
 Target Phase 
1 2 3 … N Starting Phase 1      
2      
3      
…      
N      
For the input in Card 3, the entry at position ij  of this matrix is interpreted as 
scalar data used for the transformation from phase i to phase j. This could for 
example be the transformation law or the start time .  In LS-DYNA, such a ma- 
trix is deﬁned by the keyword *DEFINE_TABLE(_2D).  The abscissa values are 
the starting phase IDs.  Each load curve (*DEFINE_C URVE) that is referenced 
consequently deﬁnes one row of the matrix.  
Some of the implemented transformation models requi re input data that is a 
function of temperature, temperature rate, equivale nt plastic strain or other 
values.  The input of this data has the same basic input structure as the scalar 
values, but the matrix entries are now load curve I Ds.  Therefore, the input is a 
three-dimensional table (*DEFINE_TABLE_3D) and each  row of the matrix is 
represented by a two-dimensional table itself deﬁne d by *DEFINE_TA-
BLE(_2D). 
2.  Phase Transformation Models.  This material features temperature and phase 
composition dependent elastic plastic behavior.  Th e phase composition is de- 
termined using a list of generic phase transformati on mechanisms you can 
choose from for each of the possible phase transfor mations.  So far, eight 
diﬀerent transformation models have been implemente d to describe the transi- 
tion from source phase concentration, |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst, to target phase concentration, |u1D46J|u1D44FCst.  
Table M254-1  at the end of this remark summarizes the input par ameters nec- 
essary for the individual models. *MAT_254  *MAT_GENERALIZED_PHASE_CHANGE  
 a)  Koistinen-Marburger (KM), law 1 .  
The KM formulation is tailored for non-diﬀusive tra nsformations.  In the 
most basic and commonly used version, the temperatu re dependent 
amount of the target phase is computed as 
|u1D46J|u1D44FCst= (|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst)|parenleftCv21.0 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FC.stKM (|u1D447Cststart −|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv2  . 
PTXI deﬁnes the so-called Koistinen-Marburger facto r, |u1D6F+KM . 
b)  Generalized Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK), law 2 . 
This is a widely used model for diﬀusive phase tran sformation.  In litera- 
ture, often the incremental form of the JMAK equati on is given for an iso- 
thermal, incomplete transformation: 
|u1D46J|u1D44FCst= |u1D46Je q (|u1D447)(|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst)

/u1D̅0F.st(|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv4/u1D45B.sts(/u1D44̅.sts)
⎠⎟⎞  . 
In the previous equation, exponent, |u1D4JB; equilibrium concentration, |u1D46Je q ; and 
relaxation time, /u1D̅0F, are functions of the temperature. 
In this material model, the diﬀerential form of the  JMAK equation is em- 
ployed which makes the model readily applicable for  non-isothermal pro- 
cesses: 
|u1D4J1|u1D46J|u1D44FCst
|u1D4J1|u1D461 = |u1D4JB(|u1D447)|parenleftCv1/u1D458|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst−/u1D458|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst |minuteCst|u1D46J|u1D44FCst|parenriµhtCv1

In this evolution equation, the following factors a re deﬁned: 
/u1D458|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst =|u1D46J|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st(|u1D447)

As user input, load curve data for the exponent, |u1D4JB(|u1D447) , is deﬁned in PT-
TAB1, the equilibrium concentration, |u1D46Je q (|u1D447), in PTTAB2, and the relaxa- 
tion time, /u1D̅0F(|u1D447), in PTTAB3.  This model is a generalized JMAK appr oach 
that features additional parameters, such as the te mperature rate correc- 
tion factors, |u1D4J3 |parenleftCv1|u1D447̇|parenriµhtCv1 and |u1D4J3′|parenleftCv1|u1D447̇|parenriµhtCv1, given in PTTAB4 and PTTAB5, respectively.  
As an optional parameter an accelerator |u1D6F+|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1 for the transformation can 
be deﬁned as function of equivalent plastic strain in PTTAB6.  If not de- 
ﬁned, a constant value of 1.0 is assumed. 
Like the Koistinen-Marburger case, a temperature de pendent equilibrium 
concentration, |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst, of the source phase can optionally be deﬁned.  If  de- *MAT_GENERALIZED_PHASE_CHANGE  *MAT_254  
 ﬁned in PTTAB7, the transformation is only active i f the source phase frac- 
tion exceeds the equilibrium, meaning |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst> |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst. 
Note that the JMAK evolution can not only be activa ted by a choice of -2 
(heating) and 2 (cooling), but also by choosing the  law to be 12.  In that 
case, the sign of the temperature rate is not check ed, and the model is al- 
ways active if the temperature is in the temperatur e window deﬁned by 
the start and end temperature of the transformation . 
c)  Kirkaldy, law 3 . 
Similar to the implementation of *MAT_244, the tran sformation for cool- 
ing phases can be computed by the evolution equatio n:  
|u1D4J1/u1D44B|u1D44FCst
|u1D4J1|u1D461 = 2|zeroCst/period.st|fiveCst(/u1D4:A.st−|oneCst)|u1D4J3 (|u1D436)(|u1D447start − |u1D447)|u1D4JBCst/u1D44̅.sts|u1D437(|u1D447)/u1D44B|u1D44FCst|u1D4JBCst|oneCsts|parenleftCv1|oneCst/period.st|zeroCst−/u1D44B.st|u1D44FCsts|parenriµhtCv1(1.0 −/u1D44B|u1D44FCst)|u1D4JBCst|twoCsts/u1D44B.st|u1D44FCsts
Y(/u1D44B|u1D44FCst)  , 
formulated in the normalized phase concentration  
/u1D44B|u1D44FCst=|u1D46J|u1D44FCst
|u1D46Je q (|u1D447)  . 
In contrast to *MAT_244, the parameters for the evo lution equation are 
not determined from the chemical composition of the  material but deﬁned 
directly as user input.  The scalar data in PTX1 to  PTX4 are interpreted as 
|u1D4J3 (|u1D436) , |u1D4JB|u1D447Cst, |u1D4JB|oneCst, and |u1D4JB|twoCst. Tabulated data for |u1D437(|u1D447) , /u1D44C(/u1D44B|u1D44FCst), and |u1D46Je q (|u1D447) are given 
in PTTAB1 to PTTAB3. 
d)  Oddy, law 4 . 
For phase transformation in heating, the equation o f Oddy can be used, 
which can be interpreted as a simpliﬁed JMAK relati on and reads as  
|u1D4J1|u1D46J|u1D44FCst
|u1D4J1|u1D461 = |u1D4JB|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst
/u1D450|oneCst(|u1D447 − |u1D447start )−|u1D4J≠Cst|twoCsts⎝⎜⎛ln |parenleftCvJ(|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst)
|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|parenriµhtCvJ
⎠⎟⎞|u1D4JBCst−|oneCst/period.st|zeroCst
|u1D4JBCst
  . 
Its application requires the input of three scalar parameters, |u1D4JB, /u1D450|oneCst, and /u1D450|twoCst, 
that are read from the respective positions in the tables in PTX1 to PTX3. 
e)  Phase recovery I, law 5.  
This phase transformation law is motivated by the r ecovery of the |u1D6FD-phase 
and |u1D6F+-phase from martensitic |u1D6F+-phase in titanium alloys and is a generali- 
zation of the algorithms described in the literatur e for this process. 
The transformation takes place if and only if the a mount of the target 
phase is below a user-deﬁned, temperature dependent  threshold, |u1D46J|u1D44Ftre .  
This threshold can be deﬁned in PTTAB3. *MAT_254  *MAT_GENERALIZED_PHASE_CHANGE  
 For |u1D46J|u1D44FCst< |u1D46J|u1D44FCsttre , t he transformation scheme comprises three steps.  Fi rst, a 
temperature dependent equilibrium fraction for the starting phase is cal- 
culated based on an incomplete KM equation: 
|u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst= (|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst− |u1D46Jinc )|parenleftCv21.0 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FC.stKM |parenleftCv1|u1D447CstKM /comm∙.sts/u1D460.sts−|u1D447Cst|parenriµhtCv1|parenriµhtCv2  . 
The KM-parameter |u1D6F+KM  and the start temperature |u1D447KM /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D46≠Cst must be given in 
PTX1 and PTX2, respectively.  The incompleteness pa rameter |u1D46Jinc  is a 
function of temperature deﬁned in PTTAB4. 
Second, if the current fraction of the starting pha se |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst exceeds the calculat- 
ed equilibrium concentration |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst,  a diﬀusional process follows.  It is de- 
scribed by a JMAK approach.  Its incremental form f or an isothermal 
process is given by 
|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst= |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst+ |parenleftCv2|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst− |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst|parenriµhtCv2|u1D4J2−|parenleftCv4|u1D461Cst
/u1D̅0F.st(|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv4/u1D45B.sts(/u1D44̅.sts)
. 
Naturally, a diﬀerential form of this equation is u sed in the model in order 
to be applicable to non-isothermal situations.  The  ﬁnal calculated change 
∆|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst in identiﬁed with the formation of a recovery phas e |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst= −∆|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst.  The 
parameters for the JMAK equation are given in PTTAB 1 ( |u1D4JB) and PTTAB2 
(/u1D̅0F). 
Third, some of the recovery phase is partially tran sformed into the target 
phase: 
∆|u1D46J|u1D44FCst= |u1D6F∆(|u1D447)|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst  . 
The quotient |u1D6F∆(|u1D447)  can be deﬁned in PTTAB5. 
f)  Phase recovery II, law 6.  
This is the second part of the recovery and can onl y be deﬁned if the pre- 
vious transformation law (law 5) has also been deﬁn ed with the same 
starting phase.  This second step aims to transform  the remaining fraction 
of the virtual, recovery phase |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst into the physical phases deﬁned in the 
material. 
In order to allow for the deﬁnition of more than tw o target phases for one 
recovery process, an optional parameter |u1D7≠2(|u1D447)  can be deﬁned as the only 
input of this transformation in PTTAB1.  It is used  to control the transfor- 
mation by  
∆|u1D46J|u1D44FCst= |u1D7≠2(|u1D447)|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst  . 
Note that |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4JFCst here refers to the complete fraction of the recove ry phase as 
calculated by the JMAK approach.  If the parameter is not deﬁned, then 
the remainder of the virtual phase fraction is comp letely transformed. *MAT_GENERALIZED_PHASE_CHANGE  *MAT_254  
 g)  Parabolic growth I, law 7.  
The transformation laws 7 and 8 model the subsequen t dissolution of a 
group of phases into one common target phase.  The remaining fraction of 
the group after dissolution within a time step is d enoted by |u1D46Jdiss .  The 
groups are identiﬁed by a group ID that is here deﬁ ned in PTX1. 
You can deﬁne a dissolution function, |u1D4J3diss , and a critical time, |u1D461crit . These 
values are expected to be functions of temperature and are deﬁned in PT-
TAB3 and PTTAB4, respectively.  Based on those and the temperature de- 
pendent equilibrium concentration |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44FCst (PTTAB2), a characteristic 
dissolution time, |u1D461diss , can be calculated as 
|u1D461diss =
⎝⎜⎛|u1D46J|u1D44FCst(|u1D447)
|u1D46J|u1D44FCste q (|u1D447)⎠⎟⎞|twoCst
|u1D461crit (|u1D447)  . 
Depending on the relative size of the step incremen t, ∆|u1D461, with respect to 
the critical and characteristic dissolution time, t he remaining group frac- 
tion |u1D46Jdiss   is calculated as 
|u1D46Jdiss =/˙raceleft.v61 − |u1D46J|u1D44FCste q (|u1D447)|u1D4J3 (|u1D447)/radical.v1∆|u1D461 + |u1D461diss (|u1D447), for  ∆|u1D461 + |u1D461diss < |u1D461crit 
1 − |u1D46J|u1D44FCste q (|u1D447), otherwise  
Now, the fraction |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst (the transformation of which is deﬁned by law 7) i s 
always assumed to be the ﬁrst member of the group t o by dissolved.  It is 
algorithmically assured that there cannot be an inc rease in fraction |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst. 
h)  Parabolic growth II, law 8.  
This law cannot be deﬁned separately, but simulates  the dissolution of the 
further members of the group already deﬁned for a t ransformation with 
law 7.  Naturally, the group ID must also be refere nced here, and it is 
again given in PTX1.  Furthermore, in the case of t hree or more members 
within a group the order in which the fractions are  to be dissolved must 
be deﬁned.  For that purpose, the position in the g roup is deﬁned in PTX2. 
i)  Extenden Koistinen-Marburger, law 9.   
This extension to the standard Koistinen-Marburger (law 1) is motivated 
by the application of the material formulation to t itanium and is only 
available in cooling. 
An equilibrium concentration |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst of the source phase can be deﬁned as 
function of the current temperature in parameter PT TAB1. The transfor- 
mation is only active if the source phase fraction exceeds the equilibrium, 
meaning |u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst> |u1D46Je q /co⋯⋯a.st|u1D44∆Cst. *MAT_254  *MAT_GENERALIZED_PHASE_CHANGE  
 Furthermore, an incomplete transformation is possib le in case of relatively 
slow cooling rates.  For this purpose, you can deﬁn e two rate limits |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|oneCst 
and |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|twoCst in PTX2 and PTX3, respectively, and an incompleten ess parame- 
ter |u1D46Jinc (|u1D447) as a function of temperature in PTTAB2.  The corre sponding 
equation for the transformation then is given by: 
|u1D46J|u1D44FCst=/˙raceleft.v6(|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst)|parenleftCv21.0 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FC.stKM (|u1D447Cststart −|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv2 , for   |u1D447̇< |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|oneCst
(|u1D46J|u1D44∆Cst+ |u1D46J|u1D44FCst− |u1D46Jinc)|parenleftCv21.0 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FC.stKM (|u1D447Cststart −|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv2 , for |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|oneCst<  |u1D447̇< |u1D447̇lim /co⋯⋯a.st|twoCst  
 
A summary of input parameters for the diﬀerent mate rial laws is given in the 
following table.  If not stated otherwise, the para meters in the tabular data PT-
TAB i are expected to be functions of the current temper ature, |u1D447.

3.  User-Deﬁned History Data.   You can deﬁne up to eight additional history 
variables that are added to the list of history var iables starting at position 31 
(see Remark 4 ). These values can for example be used to evaluate  the hardness 
of the material based on diﬀerent formulas given in  the literature. *MAT_GENERALIZED_PHASE_CHANGE  *MAT_254  
 The additional variables are to be given by respect ive *DEFINE_FUNCTION 
keywords in the input as functions of the current t ime, the user deﬁned histo- 
ries themselves, the current phase concentrations, the current temperature, the 
peak temperature, the average temperature rate betw een T2PHASE and 
T1PHASE, the current yield stress, the stress tenso r, and the current values for 
the equivalent plastic strain of the individual pha ses.  
For example, if all 24 phases are used (N = 24) and  eight additional history 
variables (NUSHIS = 8) are deﬁned, a function decla ration could look as fol- 
lows: 
*DEFINE_FUNCTION 
1,user defined history 1 
uhist(time,usrhst1,usrhst2,…,usrhst8,phase1, 
phase2,…,phase24,T,Tpeak,Trate,sigy, 
sigma1,sigma2,…,sigma6, 
epspl1,epspl2,…,epspl24)= ...  
In contrast, for four considered phases (N = 4) and  two additional histories 
(NUSHIS = 2) the keyword input could be  
*DEFINE_FUNCTION 
2,user defined history 1 
uhist(time,usrhst1,usrhst2,phase1,phase2,phase3,pha se4, 
T,Tpeak,Trate,sigy,sigma1,sigma2,…,sigma6,epspl1,ep spl2, 
epspl3,epspl4)= ...  
4.  History Values.  To be able to post-process values of history varia bles, ﬁelds 
NEIPS (shells) or NEIPH (solids) must be deﬁned on *DATABASE_EXTENT_-
BINARY. 
Aside from the user-deﬁned history variables discus sed in Remark 3 , this ma- 
terial formulation can output additional pre-deﬁned  history values for post-
processing. The input value of ﬁeld POSTV deﬁnes th e data to be written.  Its 
value is calculated as 
POST V = a|oneCst+ 2 |u1D44∆|twoCst+ 4 |u1D44∆|threeCst+8 |u1D44∆|fourCst 
Each ﬂag  |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary number (can be either 1 or 0) and corr esponds to one 
particular post-processing variable according to th e following table. This table 
also shows the order of output as well as the numbe r of extra history variables 
associated with the particular ﬂag. The values of t hese user-deﬁned histories 
are reset when the temperature is in the annealing range.

In total NXH extra variables are required depending  on the choice of parame- 
ter POSTV. For example, the maximum number of addit ional variables is 
NXH  =  14 for POSTV  =  15. 
A complete list of history variables for the materi al is given in the following 
table.  “Position” refers to the history variable n umber as listed by LS-PrePost 
when post-processing the d3plot database.  The valu e of N indicates the num- 
ber of phases accounted for in the model.

5.  Simple Annealing.  When the temperature reaches the start annealing 
temperature TASTART, the material starts assuming i ts virgin properties.  
Beyond the start annealing temperature, it behaves as an ideal elastic-plastic 
material but with no evolution of plastic strains.  
For non-zero values of both TASTART and TAEND a sim ple annealing strate- 
gy is used.  The resetting of eﬀective plastic prop erties in the annealing tem- 
perature interval is done by modifying the eﬀective  plastic strain for each 
phase as 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JBCst= |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/co⋯⋯a.ststart |u1D4JBCst |u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend − |u1D447
|u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend − |u1D447|u1D44∆Cststart   , 
where |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/co⋯⋯a.ststart |u1D4JBCst is the plastic strain for phase |u1D4JB at the beginning of the annealing 
process. 
6.  Enhanced Annealing.  For a positive value of TASTART and TAEND = 0, an 
enhanced annealing strategy is employed.  It requir es the input of an addition- 
al keyword card. 
Above the annealing start temperature |u1D447|u1D44∆Cststart , deﬁned by XASTR, the material 
behaves as an ideal-plastic material, but instead o f an evolution of the plastic 
strains, the equivalent plastic strain |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCstis reduced by a scale factor |u1D6F+(|u1D447, |u1D461)  within 
the annealing temperature window 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JBCst= |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/co⋯⋯a.ststart |u1D4JBCst|parenleftCv1|u1D6F+(|u1D447, |u1D461)|parenriµhtCv1  . 
The base value |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst/co⋯⋯a.ststart |u1D4JBCst refers to the equivalent plastic strain found in t he phase, 
|u1D4JB, when the temperature reaches the annealing start temperature for the ﬁrst 
time.  The algorithm used to determine the value of  |u1D6F+ depends on the anneal- 
ing option TASTART. 
a)  Linear annealing.   For TASTART = 1 a linear relation between tempera ture 
and the annealing eﬀect is assumed, similar to the simple annealing option 
discussed above.  But in this case an incomplete re set of the equivalent 
plastic strain data is possible.  The scale factor,  |u1D6F+, is a function of tempera- 
ture and is given by *MAT_254  *MAT_GENERALIZED_PHASE_CHANGE  
 |u1D6F+ =|u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend − |u1D447
|u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend − |u1D447|u1D44∆Cststart + |u1D6F+e q |u1D447 − |u1D447|u1D44∆Cststart 
|u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend − |u1D447|u1D44∆Cststart  
Here, the end temperature, |u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend , is deﬁned by XAEND and the newly in- 
troduced incompleteness factor, |u1D6F+e q , as scalar input data in XAFPA. 
b)  Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK). For TASTART = 2, the evolution 
of the scale factor follows a JMAK-type approach.  For isothermal situa- 
tions and assuming a start time for the process of 0.0, an incremental form 
can be explicitly stated a 
|u1D6F+ = |u1D6F+e q (|u1D447) + |parenleftCv41 − |u1D6F+e q (|u1D447)|parenriµhtCv4|u1D4J2−|parenleftCv4|u1D461Cst
/u1D̅0F.st(|u1D447Cst)|parenriµhtCv4/u1D45B.sts(/u1D44̅.sts)
. 
In the last equation, |u1D4JB(|u1D447)  denotes the exponent for the diﬀerential equa- 
tion, /u1D̅0F(|u1D447) the relaxation time and |u1D6F+|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st(|u1D447) denotes the limit value for the 
scale factor for inﬁnitely long processes.  All of those are functions of tem- 
perature and, thus, require the input of load curve  IDs in XAIPA1 ( |u1D4JB(|u1D447) ), 
XAIPA2 ( |u1D6F+e q (|u1D447)) and XAIPA3 ( /u1D̅0F(|u1D447)). 
In the material implementation a diﬀerential form o f the JMAK approach 
is invoked, which makes the formulation applicable to non-isothermal 
processes as well as independent of the start time of annealing. *MAT_PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLASTIC_THERMAL  *MAT_255  
 *MAT_PIECEWISE_LINEAR_PLASTIC_THERMAL  
This is Material Type 255, an isotropic elastoplast ic material with thermal properties.  It 
can be used for both explicit and implicit analyses .  Young’s modulus and Poisson’s 
ratio can depend on the temperature by deﬁning two load curves.  Moreover, the yield 
stress in tension and compression are given as load  curves for diﬀerent temperatures by 
using two tables.  The thermal coeﬃcient of expansi on can be given as a constant AL-
PHA or as a load curve LALPHA. A positive curve ID for LALPHA models the 
instantaneous thermal coeﬃcient, whereas a negative s curve ID models the thermal 
coeﬃcient relative to a reference temperature, TREF .  The strain rate eﬀects are 
modelled with the Cowper-Symonds rate model with th e parameters C and P on 
Card 1.  Failure can be based on eﬀective plastic s train or using the *MAT_ADD_ERO-
SION keyword.

Remarks: 
1.  Strain Rate Effects.   The strain rate eﬀect is modelled by using the Co wper 
and Symonds model which scales the yield stress acc ording to the factor 
1 + |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇|eCst /f.st/f.st
|u1D436|parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst |u1D443Cst ⁄
 
where |u1D7≠≠̇|eCst /f.st/f.st=/radical.v2tr|parenleftCv1/u1D6C6̇/u1D6C6̇/ε.st|parenriµhtCv1 is the Euclidean norm of the total strain rate ten sor if 
VP = 0 (default), otherwise |u1D7≠≠̇|eCst /f.st/f.st= |u1D7≠≠̇|eCst /f.st/f.st|u1D4JDCst. 
2.  Yield Stress Tables.  The dependence of the yield stresses on the eﬀecti ve 
plastic strains is given in two tables. 
a)  TABIDC gives the behaviour of the yield stresses i n compression 
b)  TABIDT gives the behaviour of the yield stresses i n tension. 
The table indices consist of temperatures, and at e ach temperature a yield 
stress curve must be deﬁned. 
Both TABIDC and TABIDT can be 3D tables, in which t emperatures indexes 
the main table and strain rates are deﬁned as value s for the sub tables with 
hardening curves as targets for those strain rates.  If the same yield stress 
should be used in both tension and compression, onl y one table needs to be 
deﬁned and the same TABID is put in position 1 and 2 on Card 2. If VP = 0, 
eﬀective total strain rates are used in the 3D tabl es, otherwise plastic strain 
rates. 
3.  History Variables.   Two history variables are added to the d3plot  ﬁle, the 
Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio, respective ly.  They can be requested 
through the *DATABASE_EXTENT_BINARY keyword. 
4.  Nodal Temperatures.   Nodal temperatures must be deﬁned by using a 
coupled analysis or some other way to deﬁne the tem peratures, such as 
*LOAD_THERMAL_VARIABLE or *LOAD_THERMAL_LOAD_CURVE.*MAT_256  *MAT_AMORPHOUS_SOLIDS_FINITE_STRAIN  
 *MAT_AMORPHOUS_SOLIDS_FINITE_STRAIN  
This is Material Type 256, an isotropic elastic-vis coplastic material model intended to 
describe the behaviour of amorphous solids such as polymeric glasses.  The model 
accurately captures the hardening-softening-hardeni ng sequence and the Bauschinger 
eﬀect experimentally observed at tensile loading an d unloading respectively.  The 
formulation is based on hyperelasticity and uses th e multiplicative split of the 
deformation gradient |u1D439 which makes it naturally suitable for both large r otations and 
large strains.  Stress computations are performed i n an intermediate conﬁguration and 
are therefore preceded by a pull-back and followed by a push-forward.  The model was 
originally developed by Anand and Gurtin [2003] and  implemented for solid elements 
by Bonnaud and Faleskog [2019].

Remarks: 
1.  Kinematic Hardening.   Kinematic hardening gives rise to the second 
hardening occurrence in the hardening-softening-har dening sequence.  The 
constants |u1D7≠7|u1D44JCst and |u1D7≠6|u1D43FCst enter the back stress, |u1D7≠7|u1D43J  (where |u1D43J is the left Cauchy-Green 
deformation tensor), through the function |u1D7≠7 according to: 
|u1D7≠7=|u1D7≠7|u1D44JCst|parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠6|u1D43FCst
3|u1D7≠6|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCvJ/u1D4:F−|oneCst|parenleftCv6|u1D7≠6|u1D4JDCst
|u1D7≠6|u1D43FCst|parenriµhtCv6  , (256.1)  
where |u1D7≠6|u1D4JDCst=|oneCst
/radical.v1|threeCst/radical.v1|u1D461|u1D4JF(|u1D43J|u1D4JDCst) and |u1D43J|u1D4JDCst is the plastic part of the left Cauchy-Green de- 
formation tensor and /u1D4:F is the Langevin function deﬁned by: 
/u1D4:F(/u1D44B) = coth(/u1D44B) −/u1D44B−|oneCst  . 
2.  Creep.   This material model assumes plastic incompressibi lity.  Nevertheless 
in order to account for the diﬀerent behaviours in tension and compression a 
Drucker-Prager law is included in the creep law acc ording to: 
/u1D̅08|u1D4JDCst=/u1D̅08|zeroCst|parenleftCvJ/u1D̅0F̅
|u1D46≠+|u1D6F+ /u1D̅0B |parenriµhtCvJ|oneCst|u1D4JACst/fraction.v1
  , (256.2) 
where /u1D̅08|u1D4JDCst is the equivalent plastic shear strain rate, /u1D̅0F̅ is the equivalent shear 
stress, |u1D46≠ is the internal variable deﬁned below and −/u1D̅0B is the hydrostatic stress. 
3.  Isotropic Hardening.   Isotropic hardening gives rise to the ﬁrst harden ing 
occurrence in the hardening-softening-hardening seq uence.  Two coupled in- 
ternal variables are deﬁned:  the resistance to pla stic ﬂow, |u1D46≠, and the local free 
volume, |u1D7≠2. Their evolution equations are: 
|u1D46≠̇=ℎ|zeroCst|<racketleftCvJ1−|u1D46≠
|u1D46≠̃|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠2|parenriµhtCv1|<racketriµhtCvJ/u1D̅08|u1D4JDCst (256.3)  *MAT_256  *MAT_AMORPHOUS_SOLIDS_FINITE_STRAIN

This is Material Type 258. This is an elastic-(visc o)plastic material with a non-quadratic 
yield surface where isotropic work hardening is inc luded.  A ductile failure model is 
included in the form of a damage indicator model.  The extended Cockcroft-Latham 
criterion is used to represent the dependence of th e failure strain on stress state; see 
Gruben et.  al. [2012].  Mesh dependency of the fai lure strain is damped out using a 
regularization scheme based on the deformation mode  of the shell element.  A more 
detailed description of this model can be found in the paper by Costas et al.  [2018].  The 
material is available for shell elements only.

Remarks: 
The yield function is deﬁned on the form 
|u1D4J3 =/u1Dℜ11(/u1D̅48) − (|u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D44J) 
where |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st≡/u1Dℜ11(/u1D̅48) is the equivalent stress, |u1D7≠∆|zeroCst is the initial yield stress, and |u1D44J is the 
isotropic hardening variable, which is a function o f the equivalent plastic strain |u1D4JD. The 
equivalent stress is deﬁned as 
/u1Dℜ11(/u1D̅48) =|<racketleftCvJ1
2{||u1D7≠∆|oneCst− |u1D7≠∆|twoCst||u1D44∆Cst+ |dividesCv1|u1D7≠∆|twoCst− |u1D7≠∆|threeCst|dividesCv1|u1D44∆Cst+ |dividesCv1|u1D7≠∆|threeCst− |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|dividesCv1|u1D44∆Cst}|<racketriµhtCvJ|oneCst
|u1D44∆Cst
 
where |u1D7≠∆|oneCst≥ |u1D7≠∆|twoCst≥ |u1D7≠∆|threeCst are the ordered principal stresses.  The isotropic  hardening variable 
is expressed as 
|u1D44J(|u1D4JD) = |summationCv1 |u1D44J|u1D4J6Cst|threeCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst(|u1D4JD) = |summationCv1 |u1D444|u1D4J6Cst
⎝⎜⎛1 − exp |parenleftCvJ−/u1D̅0:|u1D4J6Cst
|u1D444|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JD|parenriµhtCvJ
⎠⎟⎞|threeCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst 
where |u1D444|u1D4J6Cst and /u1D̅0:|u1D4J6Cst are in turn the saturation value and initial harde ning modulus of the 
hardening variable |u1D44J|u1D4J6Cst.  As |u1D4JD→∞ , |u1D44J attains its saturation value |u1D44J|u1D46≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D461Cst , given by 
|u1D44J|u1D46≠Cst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D461Cst = |summationCv1 |u1D444|u1D4J6Cst|threeCst
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
 
Rate-dependent plasticity is described by a fully v iscoplastic formulation.  If rate 
dependence is invoked, the equivalent stress |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st is constrained by the viscoplastic 
relation 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J2Cst /u1D45E.st= |parenleftCv1|u1D7≠∆|zeroCst+ |u1D44J(|u1D4JD)|parenriµhtCv1 |parenleftCvJ1 +|u1D4JḊ
|u1D4JḊ|u1D7≠∆Cst|parenriµhtCvJ/u1D4:6.st/u1Dℜ0E.sts
 for |u1D4J3 > 0 
in the plastic domain.  The parameters |u1D436|u1D7≠∆Cst and |u1D4JḊ|u1D7≠∆Cst govern the rate dependence of the 
material, where |u1D4JḊ|u1D7≠∆Cst is a reference strain rate.  
 
The uncoupled version of the Extended Cockcroft-Lat ham (ECL) criterion is applied 
here to deﬁne damage evolution 
|u1D437̇=/u1Dℜ11(/u1D̅48)

/u1Dℜ11(/u1D̅48)/uni2ℜE9.β4/u1D6FE.st
|u1D4JḊ 
where |u1D437 is the damage variable and /u1D44A|u1D4J≠Cst, /u1D̅1∫, and |u1D6F∆ are parameters governing the damage 
evolution and its dependence of the stress triaxial ity and the Lode parameter.  By 
setting /u1D̅1∫= |u1D6F∆ = 1 , we get the Cockcroft-Latham criterion: *MAT_258  *MAT_NON_QUADRATIC_FAILURE  
 |u1D437̇=〈|u1D7≠∆|oneCst〉
/u1D44A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4JḊ 
where /u1D44A|u1D4J≠Cst is the Cockcroft-Latham (CL) fracture parameter. 
 
In simulations with shell elements, the CL fracture  parameter /u1D44A|u1D4J≠Cst is deﬁned by 
/u1D44A|u1D4J≠Cst=Ω/u1D44A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44FCst+ (1 −Ω)/u1D44A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4JACst 
where /u1D44A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D44FCst is the CL parameter in pure bending,  /u1D44A|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4JACst  is a mesh-dependent CL parameter 
in membrane loading, and Ω  is a bending indicator given as 
Ω=1

where |u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|u1D4JDCst+ and |u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|u1D4JDCst− are the plastic thickness strain rates on the two sides of the shell 
element.  Thus, the bending indicator is Ω= 1 for pure bending ( |u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|u1D4JDCst−= −|u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|u1D4JDCst+) and Ω= 0 
(|u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|u1D4JDCst−= |u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|u1D4JDCst+) for pure membrane loading.  The mesh-dependent CL  parameter for 
membrane loading is deﬁned by

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
SCALE This variable can be used to speed up the simulatio n while 
equalizing the strain rate eﬀect, useful especially  in cases where 
the pulling speed or punch speed is slow.  For exam ple, if the 
pulling speed is at 15 mm/s but running the simulat ion at this 
speed will take a long time, the pulling speed can be increased to 
500 mm/s while SCALE can be set to 0.03, giving the same results 
as those from 15 mm/s, but with the beneﬁt of great ly reduced 
computational time, see Figures M260A-3  and M260A-4 .  Note the 
increased absolute value (within a reasonable range ) of mass 
scaling −1.0 × |u1D4J1|u1D4612|u1D4JA|u1D46≠  frequently used in forming simulation does 
not aﬀect the strain rates, as shown in the Figure M260A-5 .

 *MAT_STOUGHTON_NON_ASSOCIATED_FLOW  *MAT_260A  
 The required stress-strain hardening curve must be for uniaxial tension along the 
rolling direction.  Strain rate sensitivity is impl emented as an option, by deﬁning a 
curve (LCIDV) of strain rates vs.  stress scale fac tors, see Figure M260A-2 . 
 
The variable SCALE is very useful in speeding up th e simulation while equalizing the 
strain rate eﬀect.  For example, if the real, physi cal pulling speed is at 15 mm/s but 
running at this speed will take a long time, one co uld increase the pulling speed to 500 
mm/s while setting the SCALE to 0.03, resulting in the same results as those from 15 
mm/s with the beneﬁt of greatly reduced computation al time.  See examples in 
V erification . 
History Variables: 
1.  Damage accumulation: history variable #1 (when the  option Xue is used and 
EOS is not used).    The value ranges from 0.0 to 1 .0. 
2.  Damage accumulation: history variable #5 (when the  option Xue and EOS are 
used).  
3.  Strain rates: history variable #5 (when the option  XUE is not used). 
4.  Strain rate scale factors: history variable #6, (w hen the option XUE is not used). 
Veriﬁcation: 
Uniaxial tension tests were done on a single shell element as shown in Figure M260A-1 .  
Strain rate eﬀect LCIDV is input as shown in Figure M260A-2 .  In Figure M260A-3 , 
pulling stress vs.  strain from various test condit ions are compared with input stress-
strain curve A.  In summary, using the parameter SC ALE, the element can be pulled 
much faster (500 mm/s vs.  15 mm/s) but achieve the  same stress vs.  strain results, the 
same strain rates (history variable #5), and the sa me strain rate scale factor (history 
variable #6 in Figure M260A-4 ).  Simulation speed can be improved further with 
increased mass scaling (−1.0 × |u1D4J1|u1D4612|u1D4JA|u1D46≠)  without aﬀecting the results, see Figure M260A-5 . 
 
A partial keyword input is provided below, for the case with pulling speed of 500 
mm/s, strain hardening curve ID of 100, LCIDV curve  ID of 105, and strain rate scale 
factor of 0.03.

This is  Material Type 260B.  This material model is impleme nted based on the papers by 
Mohr, D., et al. (2010) and Roth, C.C. and Mohr, D.  (2014) [ 1, 2].  The Johnson-Cook 
plasticity model which includes strain hardening, strain rate hardening, and 
temperature softening is modiﬁed with a mixed Swift-Voce strain hardening function 
coupled with a non-associated ﬂow rule.  For certain Advanced High Strength Steels 
(AHSS), the non-associated ﬂow rule accounts for the diﬀere nce between directional 
dependency of the |u1D4JF-values (planar anisotropic) and the planar isotrop ic material 
response.  A ductile fracture model is included bas ed on Hosford-Coulomb fracture 
initiation model.  This model applies to shell elem ents only.

SCALE This ﬁeld can be used to speed up the simulation while equali zing 
the strain rate eﬀect, which is useful especially in cases where the 
pulling speed or punch speed is slow.  For example,  if the pulling 
speed is 15 mm/s but running the simulation at this  speed will 
take a long time, the pulling speed can be increase d to 500 mm/s 
while "SCALE" can be set to 0.03, giving the same r esults as those 
from 15 mm/s with greatly reduced computational tim e; see 
examples and Figures in *MAT_260A for details.  Furthermore, 
the increased absolute value (within a reasonable r ange) of mass 
scaling -1.0 × dt2ms frequently used in forming simulation does 
not aﬀect the strain rates, as shown in the example s and Figure s 
in *MAT_260A.

 Remarks: 
1.  Non-associated Flow Rule.  Referring to [ 1] and [ 2], Hill’s 1948 quadratic 
yield function is written as: 
|u1D4J3 (/u1D6D4,/u1D458) = |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt−/u1D458= 0  , 
where /u1D6D4 is the Cauchy stress tensor and |u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt is the equivalent stress, deﬁned by: 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt=/radical.v1(/u1D40F /u1D6D4 )∙/u1D6D4  . 
/u1D40F is a symmetric positive-deﬁnite matrix deﬁned thro ugh three independent 
parameters, |u1D443|oneCst|twoCst , |u1D443|twoCst|twoCst , and |u1D443|threeCst|threeCst : 
/u1D40F=
⎣⎢⎡1 P|oneCst|twoCst 0
P|oneCst|twoCst P|twoCst|twoCst 0
0 0 P|threeCst|threeCst ⎦⎥⎤  . 
The ﬂow rule, which deﬁnes the incremental plastic strain tensor, is written as 
follows: 
|u1D4J1/u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst= |u1D4J1|u1D6FF |u1D71J|u1D4J4(/u1D6D4)
|u1D71J/u1D6D4  , 
where |u1D4J1|u1D6FF  is a scalar plastic multiplier.  The plastic poten tial function |u1D4J4(/u1D6D4) can 
be deﬁned as a quadratic function in stress space: 
|u1D4J4(/u1D6D4) =/radical.v1(/u1D406 /u1D6D4 )∙/u1D6D4 
with, 
/u1D406=
⎣⎢⎡1 |u1D43A|oneCst|twoCst 0
G|oneCst|twoCst G|twoCst|twoCst 0
0 0 G|threeCst|threeCst ⎦⎥⎤  . 
When /u1D40F/u1D406, the ﬂow rule is non-associated.  The associated ﬂo w rule is recov- 
ered if  /u1D40F=/u1D406. For example, /u1D40F can represent an isotropic von-Mises yield sur- 
face by setting |u1D443|oneCst|oneCst = |u1D443|twoCst|twoCst = 1.0 , |u1D443|oneCst|twoCst = −0.5 , and |u1D443|threeCst|threeCst = 3.0 .  /u1D406 can represent an 
orthotropic plastic ﬂow potential by setting: 
|u1D43A|oneCst|twoCst  = −|u1D4JF|zeroCst
1 + |u1D4JF|zeroCst  ,
|u1D43A|twoCst|twoCst  =|u1D4JF|zeroCst(1 + |u1D4JF/nine.st |zeroCst )
|u1D4JF/nine.st |zeroCst (1 + |u1D4JF|zeroCst)  ,
|u1D43A|threeCst|threeCst  =(1 + 2|u1D4JF|fourCst|fiveCst )(|u1D4JF|zeroCst+ |u1D4JF/nine.st |zeroCst )
|u1D4JF/nine.st |zeroCst (1 + |u1D4JF|zeroCst)  . 
Here |u1D4JF|zeroCst, |u1D4JF|fourCst|fiveCst , and |u1D4JF/nine.st |zeroCst  are the Lankford coeﬃcients in the rolling, diagon al and 
transverse directions, respectively.  Experiments h ave shown on the stress lev- 
el, some AHSS (Advanced High Strength Steel), e.g.,  DP590, and TRIP780 show 
strong directional dependency for the |u1D4JF-values, while nearly the same stress-
strain curves have been measured in all directions.   The directional dependen- 
cy of |u1D4JF-values suggests planar anisotropy while the materi al response for the *MAT_260B  *MAT_MOHR_NON_ASSOCIATED_FLOW  
 stress is planar isotropic, which is the main reaso n to employ the non-
associated ﬂow rule. 
2.  A Modiﬁed Johnson-Cook Plasticity Model with Mixed Swift-Voce 
Hardening.  The Johnson-Cook plasticity model (1983) multiplic atively decom- 
poses the deformation resistance into three functio ns representing the eﬀects of 
strain hardening, strain rate, and temperature.  Th e Johnson-Cook model is 
modiﬁed to include hardening saturation with a mixe d Swift-Voce hardening 
law (Sung et al, 2010 [ 3]), which gives a better description of the hardeni ng at 
large strain levels, thus improving the prediction of the necking and post-
necking response of metal sheet:

To make this material model more general and ﬂexibl e, three load curves are 
used to deﬁne the three components of the deformati on resistance.  A load 
curve (LCIDS) is used to describe the strain harden ing: 
|u1D6F+|parenleftCv2|u1D434|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|u1D4J9Cst + |u1D7≠≠|zeroCst|parenriµhtCv2|u1D4JBCst|parenriµhtCv2 + (1 − |u1D6F+) |parenleftCv4/u1D458|zeroCst+ |u1D444|parenleftCv31 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|u1D4JDCsts /u1D4⃡9.sts|parenriµhtCv3|parenriµhtCv4 
Strain rate is described by a load curve LCIDV (str ess scale factor vs.  strain 
rates, Figure M260B-1  middle), which scales the stresses based on the st rain 
rates during a simulation: 
1 + |u1D436 /u1D45∫|u1D4JB 
⎝⎜⎛ |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst|u1D4J9Cst 
|u1D7≠≠|zeroCsṫ⎠⎟⎞ 
The temperature softening eﬀect is deﬁned by anothe r load curve LCIDT 
(stress scale factor as a function of temperature, Figure M260B-1  bottom), 
which scales the stresses based on the temperatures  during the simulation: 
1 − |parenleftCvJ|u1D447 − |u1D447|u1D4JFCst
|u1D447|u1D4JACst− |u1D447|u1D4JFCst|parenriµhtCvJ|u1D4JACst
 
The temperature eﬀect is a self-contained model, me aning it does not require 
thermal exchange with the environment.  It calculat es temperatures based on 
plastic strain and strain rate. 
The temperature evolution is determined with: *MAT_MOHR_NON_ASSOCIATED_FLOW  *MAT_260B

As shown in a single shell element undergoing uniax ial stretching (see Fig- 
ure M260B-1 ), the general eﬀect of LCIDV is to elevate the str ain hardening 
behavior as the strain rate increases (curve “D” in  Figure M260B-2  top), while 
the eﬀect of LCIDT is strain softening as the tempe rature rises (curve “C” in 
Figure M260B-2  top).  Initially, due to the combined eﬀect of bot h LCIDV and 
LCIDT strain hardening may occur before the tempera ture rises enough to 
cause strain softening in the model (curve “E” in Figure M260B-2  top).  The 
temperature and strain rates calculated for each el ement can be viewed with 
history variables #4 and #5 (curves “C” and “D” in Figure M260B-2  bottom), 
respectively, while the strain rate scale factors a nd temperature scale factors 
can be viewed with history variable #6 and #7, resp ectively. 
3.  Rate-dependent Hosford-Coulomb Fracture Initiation Model.   An 
extension of the Hosford-Coulomb fracture initiatio n model is used to account 
for the eﬀect of strain rate on ductile fracture.  The damage accumulation is 
calculated through history variable #3.  When this history variable reaches 1.0, 
fracture occurs at an equivalent plastic strain, |u1D7≠≠̅/u1D45:.st, that is, 
/integral.v:|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠̅|u1D4JDCst|u1D4J9Cst

SIGY In-plane shear yield stress (only used when BE TA < 1.0) 
LCSS Load curve ID or Table ID. 
Load Curve.   When LCSS is a load curve ID, it deﬁnes the non-
linear in-plane shear-stress as a function of in-pl ane shear- strain 
(|u1D6F∆|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst ). 
Tabular Data.   The table maps in-plane strain rate values ( |u1D6F∆̇|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst ) to 
a load curve giving the in-plane shear-stress as a function of in-
plane shear- strain.  For strain rates below the minimum value, the 
curve for the lowest deﬁned value of strain rate is  used.  Likewise, 
when the strain rate ex ceeds the maximum value, the curve for 
the highest deﬁned value of strain rate is used. 
Logarithmically Deﬁned Table.   An alternative way to invoke 
logarithmic interpolation between discrete strain r ates is *MAT_LAMINATED_FRACTURE_DAIMLER_PINHO  *MAT_261  
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
described as follows.  If the ﬁrst  value in the table is negative, LS-
DY NA assumes that all the table values represent the natural 
logarithm of a strain rate.  Since the tables are i nternally 
discretized to equally space the table values, it m akes good sense 
from an accuracy standpoint that the table values represent the 
natural log of strain rate when the lowest strain r ate and highest 
strain rate diﬀer by several orders of magnitude.  There is some 
additional computational cost associated with invok ing 
logarithmic interpolation. 
BETA Hardening parameter for in- plane shear plasticity 
(0.0 ≤ BETA ≤ 1.0). 
EQ.0.0: Pure kinematic hardening 
EQ.1.0: Pure isotropic hardening 
0.0 < BETA < 1.0: Mixed hardening 
PFL Percentage of shell or tshell layers which must fai l until 
crashfront is initiated.  For example, if |PFL|  = 80.0, then 80% of 
layers must fail until strengths are reduced in nei ghboring 
elements.  Default: all layers must fail.  A single  layer fails if 1 in-
plane integration point fails (PFL > 0) or if 4 in- plane integration 
points fail (PFL < 0).

2.  Damage Evolution.   As long as the stress state is located within the  failure 
surface, the model behaves in an orthotropic elasti c manner.  When reaching 
the failure criteria, the eﬀective (undamaged) stre sses will be reduced by a 
factor of (1 − |u1D4J1) , where the damage variable |u1D4J1 represents one of the damage 
variables deﬁned for the diﬀerent failure mechanism s ( |u1D4J1da , |u1D4J1k in k , |u1D4J1mat ). The 
growth of these damage variables is driven by a lin ear damage evolution law 
based on fracture toughnesses ( /u1D6E4 → ENKINK, ENA, ENB, ENT, ENL) and a 
characteristic internal element length, /u1D4:F, to account for objectivity.  See Figure

 3.  Nonlinear In-Plane Shear.   To account for the characteristic nonlinear in-
plane shear behavior of laminated ﬁber-reinforced c omposites, a 1D elasto-
plastic formulation is coupled to a linear damage b ehavior once the maximum 
allowable stress state for shear failure is reached .  The non-linearity of the 
shear behavior can be introduced using the deﬁnitio n of an explicit shear stress 
as a function of engineering shear strain curve (LC SS) with *DEFINE_CURVE.  
See Figure M261-3  (in which /u1D̅16|u1D44∆Cst|u1D44FCst  designates engineering shear strain rather than 
tensorial shear strain). 
4.  Element Deletion.   When failure has occurred in all the composite la yers 
(through-thickness integration points), the element  is deleted.  Elements that 
share nodes with the deleted element become “crashf ront” elements and can 
have their strengths reduced by using the SOFT para meter.  An earlier initia- 
tion of crashfront elements is possible by using th e parameter PFL. 
5.  History Variables.   The number of additional integration point variab les 
written to the LS-DYNA database is input by the *DA TABASE_EXTENT_BI-
NARY deﬁnition with the variable NEIPS (shells) and  NEIPH (solids).  These 
additional variables are tabulated below ( i = integration point).    
When intending to initialize the stress state using  *INTIAL_STRESS_ OPTION , 
the stress values SIGXX, SIGYY, etc.  in *INITIAL_S TRESS_ OPTION  are not 
used, rather stresses are determined from the total  strain history variables 31 to 
36.

Once the stress state reaches the failure criterion , a set of scalar damage variables 
(|u1D4J1|oneCst−, |u1D4J1|oneCst+,  |u1D4J1|twoCst−, |u1D4J1|twoCst+, |u1D4J1|sixCst) is introduced associated with the diﬀerent failur e mechanisms.  
A bi-linear (longitudinal direction) and a linear ( transverse direction) damage evolution 
law is used to deﬁne the development of the damage variables driven by the fracture 
toughness and a characteristic internal element len gth to account for objectivity.  See 
Figure M262-2 . 
To account for the characteristic non-linear in-pla ne shear behavior of laminated ﬁber-
reinforced composites a 1D elasto-plastic formulati on with linear hardening is coupled 
to a linear damage behavior once the maximum allowa ble stress state for shear failure is 
reached.  See Figure M262-3 . 
More detailed information about this material model  can be found in Maimí, Camanho, 
Mayugo and Dávila [2007].  
When failure has occurred in all the composite laye rs (through-thickness integration 
points), the element is deleted.  Elements which sh are nodes with the deleted element Damage evolution:

parameter PFL.  
The number of additional integration point variable s written to the LS-DYNA database 
is input by the *DATABASE_EXTENT_BINARY deﬁnition w ith the variable NEIPS 
(shells) and NEIPH (solids).  These additional vari ables are tabulated below ( |u1D4J6 = 
integration point). 
When intending to initialize the stress state using  *INTIAL_STRESS_ OPTION , the stress 
values SIGXX, SIGYY, etc.  in *INITIAL_STRESS_ OPTION  are not used, rather stresses 
are determined from the total strain history variab les 31 to 36.

This is  Material Type 263. It is based on the anisotropic y ield function proposed by Lou 
and Yoon (Lou and Yoon, 2017).  This yield function  extends the original Drucker 
function into an anisotropic form using a fourth or der linear transformation tensor.  The 
non-associated ﬂow rule (non-AFR) can be applied to  accurately describe both the 
directional yield stresses and |u1D44J-values.  The anisotropic ﬂexibility of this model can be 
further improved by summing up components of the an isotropic Drucker function.  See 
the section Constitutive relations  below for more details.  This model is supported f or 
shell and solid elements.

Hardening laws: 
The implemented hardening laws are the following: 
1.  The Swift hardening law 
2.  The Voce hardening law 
3.  The Gosh hardening law 
4.  The Hocket-Sherby hardening law 
5.  A loading curve, where the yield stress is given a s a function of the eﬀective 
plastic strain 
 
The Swift hardening law can be written as: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2 =/u1D45E|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|zeroCst+ |u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2|u1D4JBCst  , 
where /u1D45E and |u1D4JB are material parameters.  
The Voce equation says that the yield stress can be  written in the following form: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst ep  , 
where |u1D44∆, |u1D44Fand /u1D450 are material parameters.  The Gosh equation is sim ilar to the Swift 
equation.  They only diﬀer by a constant 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2 =/u1D45E|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠|zeroCst+ |u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2|u1D4JBCst− |u1D4JD  , *MAT_LOU-YOON_ANISOTROPIC_PLASTICITY  *MAT_263  
 where /u1D45E, |u1D7≠≠|zeroCst, |u1D4JB and |u1D4JD are material constants.  The Hocket-Sherby equatio n resemblance 
the Voce equation, but with an additional parameter  added 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ep |parenriµhtCv2 = |u1D44∆ − |u1D44F|u1D4J2−|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠≠Cst ep /u1D45B.sts
 . 
where |u1D44∆, |u1D44F,/u1D450 and |u1D4JB are material parameters. 
Constitutive relations: 
Drucker proposed a yield function that includes the  eﬀect of the third stress invariant in 
the classic Von Mises yield function.  Lou and Yoon  (2017) extended this yield function 
to an anisotropic form as shown below: 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenriµhtCv2 = (/u1D4:D′|twoCst|threeCst−/u1D450/u1D4:D′|threeCst|twoCst)|oneCst |sixCst ⁄  . 
Here /u1D4:D|twoCst|minuteCst and /u1D4:D|threeCst|minuteCst are the second and third invariants of the linear transformed deviatoric 
stress tensor /u1D42C′: 
/u1D42C|minuteCst=/u1D40B|minuteCst/u1D6D4 . 
The fourth order linear transformation tensor /u1D40B′ is given by:

  . 
/u1D450|oneCst|minuteCst, /u1D450|twoCst|minuteCst, /u1D450|threeCst|minuteCst and /u1D450|sixCst|minuteCst can be calibrated from uniaxial tensile yield stre ss along diﬀerent 
directions and the balanced biaxial yield stress.  /u1D450|fourCst|minuteCst and /u1D450|fiveCst|minuteCst, which are related to the 
through-thickness material properties, are very diﬃ cult to obtain experimentally and 
therefore assumed to be identical with /u1D450|sixCst|minuteCst. 
 
With the non-associated ﬂow rule (non-AFR), the pla stic ﬂow is not necessarily aligned 
with the yield surface normal and the |u1D44J-values are modeled by a diﬀerent plastic 
potential: 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D4JDCst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenriµhtCv2 = (/u1D4:D̂|twoCst|threeCst−/u1D450/u1D4:D̂|threeCst|twoCst)|oneCst |sixCst ⁄  . 
Here /u1D4:D̂|twoCst and /u1D4:D̂|threeCst are the second and third invariants of the linear transformed deviatoric 
stress tensor: 
/u1D42Ĉ=/u1D40B̂/u1D6D4  . 
And /u1D4̅:̂ is deﬁned as:  *MAT_263  *MAT_LOU-YOON_ANISOTROPIC_PLASTICITY  
 /u1D40B̂=

   . 
The anisotropic parameters /u1D450̂|oneCst, /u1D450̂|twoCst, /u1D450̂|threeCst and /u1D450̂|sixCst can be calibrated with experimentally 
measured |u1D44J-values along diﬀerent directions. 
 
Another approach to improve the ﬂexibility of the y ield function is to sum up |u1D4JB 
components of the anisotropic Drucker functions as follows: 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D466Cst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenriµhtCv2 =1

|u1D4JACst=|oneCst  . 
where |u1D4JB is an integer with |u1D4JB ≥ 1 . The same idea can be applied to the plastic poten tial in 
the non-AFR approach, as shown in equation: 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|u1D4JDCst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenriµhtCv2 =1

|u1D4JACst=|oneCst  .

This is  Material Type 266.  This material is an invariant f ormulation for dispersed 
orthotropy in soft tissues, e.g., heart valves, art erial walls or other tissues where one or 
two collagen ﬁbers are used.  The passive contribut ion is composed of an isotropic and 
two anisotropic parts.  The isotropic part is a sim ple neo-Hookean model.  The ﬁrst 
anisotropic part is passive, with two collagen ﬁber s to choose from: (1) a simple 
exponential model and (2) a more advanced crimped ﬁ ber model from Freed et al.  
[2005].  The second anisotropic part is active desc ribed in Guccione et al.  [1993] and is 
used for active contraction. 
NOTE:  This material model is obsolete.  Please use MAT_-
ANISOTROPIC_HYPERELASTIC that contains most 
of the features of MAT_TISSUE_DISPERSED. For

 VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MID Material identiﬁcation.  A unique number must b e speciﬁed. 
RO Mass density. 
F Fiber dispersion parameter governs the extent to wh ich the ﬁber 
dispersion extends to the third dimension. F = 0  and F = 1  apply 
to 2D splay with the normal to the membrane being i n the  |u1D6FD and 
the |u1D6F∆-directions, respectively (see Figure M266-1 ). F = 0.5  applies 
to 3D splay with transverse isotropy.  Splay will b e orthotropic 
whenever F≠0.5. This parameter is ignored if INIT = 1. 
SIGMA The parameter SIG MA governs the extent of dispersion, such that 
as SIG MA goes to zero, the material symmetry reduces to p ure 
transverse isotropy.  Conversely, as SIG MA becomes large, the 
material symmetry becomes isotropic in the plane.  This 
parameter is ignored if INIT = 1. *MAT_266  *MAT_TISSUE_DISPERSED  
  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
MU MU is the isotropic shear modulus that models elast in.  MU 
should be chosen such that the following relation i s satisﬁed: 
0.5 (3KAPPA − 2M U ) (3KAPPA + M U ) ⁄ < 0.5. 
Instability can occur for implicit simulations if t his quotient is 
close to 0.5. A modest approach is a quotient betwe en 0.495 and 
0.497. 
KAPPA Bulk modulus for the hydrostatic pressure. 
ACT ACT = 1 indicates that an active model will be used that acts i n 
the mean ﬁber- direction.  The active model, like the passive 
model, will be dispersed by SIGMA and F, or if INIT  = 1, with the 
*INITIAL_FIELD_SOLID keyword. 
INIT INIT = 1 indicates that the anisotropy eigenvalues will be  given 
by *INITIAL_FIELD_SOL ID variables in the global coordinate 
system (see Remark 1). 
FID The passive ﬁber model number.  There are two passi ve models 
available: FID = 1 or FID = 2. They are described i n Remark 2. 
ORTH ORTH speciﬁes the number (1 or 2) of ﬁbers use d.  When OR-
TH = 2 two ﬁber families are used and arranges symmetric ally 
THETA degrees from the mean ﬁber direction and lyin g in the 
tissue plane. 
C1-C3 Passive ﬁber model parameters.

Details of the passive model can be found in Freed et al.  (2005) and Einstein et al.  
(2005).  The stress in the reference conﬁguration c onsists of a deviatoric matrix term, a 
hydrostatic pressure term, and either one (ORTHO = 1) or two (ORTH = 2) ﬁber terms:

|u1D7≠6 is not a stretch in the classical way, since K embeds the concept of dispersion. K is 
called the dispersion tensor or anisotropy tensor a nd is given in global coordinates.  The 
passive and active ﬁber models are deﬁned in the ﬁb er coordinate system.  In eﬀect the 
dispersion tensor rotates and weights these one dim ensional models, such that they are 
both three-dimensional and in the Cartesian framewo rk.

Remarks: 
1.  Passive ﬁber models.  Currently there are two mode ls available. 
a)  If  FID = 1 a crimped ﬁber model is used.  It is s olely developed for colla- 
gen ﬁbers.  Given  /u1D4:B|zeroCst and |u1D44J|zeroCst compute:  
/u1D4:F|zeroCst=/radical.v2(2/u1D̅0B)|twoCst+ (/u1D4:B|zeroCst)|twoCst,Λ=/u1D4:F|zeroCst
/u1D4:B|zeroCst 
and 
|u1D438|u1D46≠Cst=|u1D438/u1D45:.st/u1D4:B|zeroCst
/u1D4:B|zeroCst+ |parenleftCv61 +3 7

/u1D̅0B|twoCst|parenriµhtCv6 (/u1D4:F|zeroCst−/u1D4:B|zeroCst). 
Now if the ﬁber stretches |u1D7≠6 <Λ the ﬁber stress is given by: 
|u1D7≠∆ =/u1D̅0∫|u1D438|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠6 − 1) 
where 
/u1D̅0∫=6/u1D̅0B|twoCst|parenleftCv2Λ|twoCst+ |parenleftCv24/u1D̅0B|twoCst− 1|parenriµhtCv2|u1D7≠6|twoCst|parenriµhtCv2|u1D7≠6

and if |u1D7≠6 >Λ the ﬁber stress equals: 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D438|u1D46≠Cst(|u1D7≠6 − 1) + |u1D438/u1D45:.st(|u1D7≠6 −Λ). 
In Figure M266-1  the ﬁber stress is rendered with /u1D4:B0 = 2 7.5, |u1D44J0 = 2  and 
the transition point becomes Λ= 1.1.  *MAT_266  *MAT_TISSUE_DISPERSED  
 b)  The second ﬁber model available (FID = 2) is a sim pler but  more useful 
model for the general ﬁber reinforced rubber.  The ﬁber stress is simply 
given by: 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D436|oneCst|<racketleftCv6|u1D4J2/u1D4:6.st|twoCsts
|twoCst|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠6Cst|twoCsts−|oneCst|parenriµhtCv2− 1|<racketriµhtCv6. 
The diﬀerence between the two ﬁber models is given in Figure M266-2 . 
The active model for myoﬁbers (ACT = 1) is deﬁned i n Guccione et al.  (1993) 
and is given by: 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D447max |u1D436|u1D44∆|zeroCst|twoCst
|u1D436|u1D44∆|zeroCst|twoCst+ |u1D438|u1D436|u1D44∆|fiveCst|zeroCst |twoCst|u1D436(|u1D461) 
where 
|u1D438|u1D436|u1D44∆|fiveCst|zeroCst |twoCst=(|u1D436|u1D44∆|zeroCst)|mCst|aCst|xCst

and |u1D43J is a constant, (|u1D436|u1D44∆|zeroCst)|mCst|aCst|xCst  is the maximum peak intracellular calcium con- 
centration, /u1D45∫|zeroCst is the sarcomere length at which no active tension  develops and /u1D45∫|u1D4JFCst 
is the stress free sarcomere length.  The function |u1D436(|u1D461) is deﬁned in one of two 
ways.  First it can be given as: 
|u1D436(|u1D461) =1
2|parenleftCv11 − cos|u1D714(|u1D461)|parenriµhtCv1

Basic Theory.   This model is based on the work done by Arruda an d Boyce [1993], 
in particular Arruda’s thesis [1992].  The eight ch ain rubber model is based on 
hyper-elasticity, and it is formulated by using ela stic strain invariants.  Strain 
softening is accounted for by the parameter from |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst following the work done by Qi 
and Boyce [2004]. 
 
The strain energy is deﬁned in terms of the elastic  deformation gradient /u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst through 
the right Cauchy-Green tensor /u1D46A|u1D4J2Cst=/u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst|u1D447Cst/u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst and its determinant /u1D4:D|u1D4J2Cst= det /u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst as /u1D6F∫=/u1D6F∫|oneCst+
/u1D6F∫|twoCst where 
 
/u1D6F∫|oneCst= |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst|u1D7≠7|<racketleftCvJ/radical.v1/u1D441/u1D6EC|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D6FD +/u1D441ln |parenleftCvJ|u1D6FD

/u1D4:D|u1D4J2Cst/u1D̅08.stcon − 1|parenriµhtCv6  
is the volumetric contribution.  Here 
 
|u1D6FD =ℒ−|oneCst
⎝⎜⎛Λ|u1D4J≠Cst
/radical.v1/u1D441⎠⎟⎞ 
with ℒ−|oneCst denoting the inverse of the Langevin function ℒ(|u1D46J) = coth|u1D46J − 1/|u1D46J  and the 
ampliﬁed chain stretch is given by  
Λ|u1D4J≠Cst=/radical.v2/u1D44B(|u1D463|u1D46≠Cst)|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠6/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|twoCst− 1|parenriµhtCv2 + 1 , 
where |u1D7≠6/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt|twoCst= Tr|parenleftCv1/u1D46A̅|u1D4J2Cst|parenriµhtCv1 3 ⁄ and /u1D46A̅|u1D4J2Cst=/u1D4:D|u1D4J2Cst−|twoCst/|threeCst/u1D46A|u1D4J2Cst. 
 
Among the constant parameters we have |u1D7≠7 is the initial modulus of the soft domain, 
/u1D̅05 the bulk modulus, /u1D̅08con  a pressure inﬂuential exponent and  /u1D441 is the number of 
rigid links between crosslinks of the soft domain r egion. /u1D44B is a general polynomial 
describing the interaction between the soft and har d phases (Qi and Boyce [2004] 
and Tobin and Mullins [1957]).  It is given by 
/u1D44B(|u1D463|u1D46≠Cst) = 1 + |u1D434(1 − |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst) + |u1D43J(1 − |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst)|twoCst *MAT_267  *MAT_EIGHT_CHAIN_RUBBER  
 where |u1D434 and |u1D43J are constants, and an e v olution of |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst is gi v en b elow.  
 
The Cauchy stress is then computed as 
/u1D̅48=2

where /u1D469|u1D4J2Cst=/u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst/u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst|u1D447Cst is the left elastic Cauchy-Green tensor.  Without any Mullins 
eﬀects, /u1D̅08|u1D46≠Cst= 1. 
 
1.  Mullins Effect.   Two models for the Mullins eﬀect are implemented.  
a)  MULL = 1 .  The strain softening is developed by the evoluti on law taken 
from Boyce 2004: 
|u1D463̇|u1D46≠Cst= |u1D44D(|u1D463|u1D46≠Cst|u1D46≠Cst − |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst)/radical.v1/u1D441− 1
|parenleftCv3/radical.v1/u1D441−Λ|u1D4J≠Cst|mCst|aCst|xCst |parenriµhtCv3|twoCstΛ̇|u1D4J≠Cst|mCst|aCst|xCst   , 
where |u1D44D is a parameter that characterizes the evolution in  |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst with increas- 
ing Λ̇|u1D4J≠Cst|mCst|aCst|xCst . The parameter |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst|u1D46≠Cst  is the saturation value of |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst. Note that Λ̇|u1D4J≠Cst|mCst|aCst|xCst  is 
the maximum of Λ|u1D4J≠Cst from the past: 
Λ̇|u1D4J≠Cst|mCst|aCst|xCst = |<raceleftCvJ0Λ|u1D4J≠Cst<Λ|u1D4J≠Cst|mCst|aCst|xCst 
Λ̇|u1D4J≠CstΛ|u1D4J≠Cst>Λ|u1D4J≠Cst|mCst|aCst|xCst . 
The structure now evolves with the deformation.  Th e dissipation inequal- 
ity requires that the evolution of the structure is  irreversible |u1D463̇|u1D46≠Cst≥ 0.  See Qi 
and Boyce [2004]. 
b)  MULL = 2 .  The energy driven model is based on Ogden and Ro xburgh.  
When activated the strain energy is automatically t ransformed to a stand- 
ard eight chain model, meaning the variables |u1D44D, |u1D463|u1D46≠Cst and /u1D44B are automatical- 
ly set to 0, 1, and 1, respectively.  The stress is  multiplicative split of the 
true stress and the softening factor |u1D7≠2. 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt= |u1D7≠2|u1D7≠∆,   |u1D7≠2 = 1 −1

|u1D44≠3 − |u1D44≠2Ψ|oneCst|mCst|aCst|xCst |parenriµhtCv6  . 
2.  Viscoelasticity.  Two models for viscoelasticity are implemented. 
a)  VISEL = 1 .  The viscoelasticity is based on work done by Hol zapfel (2004) 
/u1D410̇/u1D6FC.st+/u1D410/u1D6FC.st
/u1D̅0F/u1D6FC.st= 2|u1D6FD/u1D6FC.st|u1D4J1
|u1D4J1|u1D461 ∂Ψ|oneCst
∂/u1D402|u1D4J2Cst= |u1D6FD/u1D6FC.st/u1D412̇/u1D̅CF 
where |u1D6F+ is the number of viscoelastic terms (1, …, 6). *MAT_EIGHT_CHAIN_RUBBER  *MAT_267  
 b)  VISEL = 2.   With this option the evolution is based on work d one by Simo 
and Hughes (2000). 
/u1D410̇/u1D6FC.st+/u1D410/u1D6FC.st
/u1D̅0F/u1D6FC.st= 2|u1D6F∆|u1D44∆Cst
/u1D̅0F|u1D44∆Cst|u1D4J1
|u1D4J1|u1D461 ∂Ψ|oneCst
∂/u1D402|u1D4J2Cst=|u1D6F∆|u1D44∆Cst
/u1D̅0F|u1D44∆Cst/u1D412/u1D̅CF 
The number of Prony terms is restricted to a maximu m of 6.  Also /u1D̅0F/u1D6FC.st and 
|u1D6F∆/u1D6FC.st must be greater than 0.  The Cauchy stress is obta ined by a push for- 
ward operation on the total second Piola-Kirchhoﬀ s tress. 
σ=1
/u1D4:D/u1D405|u1D4J2Cst/u1D412/u1D405|u1D4J2Cst|u1D447Cst. 
3.  Viscoplasticity.   Plasticity is based on the general Hills’ yield s urface 
|u1D7≠∆eff |twoCst= |u1D439(|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst − |u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst )|twoCst+ |u1D43A(|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst − |u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst )|twoCst+/u1D4:B(|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst − |u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst )|twoCst+ 2/u1D4:F|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst |twoCst+ 2|u1D44≠|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|threeCst |twoCst+ 2/u1D441|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|threeCst |twoCst 
and the hardening is either based on a load curve I D (-YLD0) or an extended Voce 
hardening 
|u1D7≠∆yld = |u1D7≠∆yld0+ |u1D444|oneCst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2|u1D43JCst|oneCsts|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D444|twoCst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2|u1D43JCst|twoCsts|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D444|threeCst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2|u1D43JCst|threeCsts|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|parenriµhtCv2 + |u1D444|fourCst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2|u1D43JCst/four.sts|u1D7≠≠Cst̅|parenriµhtCv2  . 
The evolution of the elastic deformation gradient /u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst is written as 
 
/u1D46Ḋ|u1D4J2Cst= (/u1D4̅:−/u1D4̅:|u1D4JDCst)/u1D46D|u1D4J2Cst 
 
where /u1D4̅: is the spatial velocity gradient and /u1D4̅:|u1D4JDCst is the spatial (Eulerian) plastic 
velocity gradient which is given by the associative  ﬂow rule 
/u1D4̅:|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠̅̇|u1D71J|u1D4J3 
|u1D71J/u1D̅48 
 
with |u1D4J3 being the rate independent yield surface 
|u1D4J3 = |u1D7≠∆eff − |u1D7≠∆yld . 
For rate independent plasticity ( VISPL = 0 ) the evolution of plastic strain |u1D7≠≠̅ follows 
from the consistency conditions |u1D4J3 ≤ 0 , |u1D7≠≠̅̇≥ 0 and |u1D4J3 |u1D7≠≠̅̇= 0. For viscoplasticity these 
conditions are abandoned, but we instead invoke a c onstitutive equation for the 
eﬀective plastic strain rate.  This is the Perzyna (1966) overstress model, and three 
diﬀerent formulations are available. 
a)  VISPL = 1 .  The evolution equation is 
|u1D7≠≠̅̇= |parenleftCvJmax (|u1D4J3 , 0)
|u1D43∆|oneCst|parenriµhtCvJ/u1D446.st|oneCsts
  , 
where |u1D43∆|oneCst and |u1D446|oneCst are viscoplastic material parameters. 
b)  VISPL = 2 .  The evolution equation is *MAT_267  *MAT_EIGHT_CHAIN_RUBBER  
 |u1D7≠≠̅̇=
⎣⎢⎡ max (|u1D4J3 , 0)
|u1D43∆|oneCst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2−/u1D446.st|oneCsts(|u1D7≠≠Cst̅+/u1D4:E.st|twoCsts)|parenriµhtCv2|u1D4J2/u1D446.st|twoCsts|u1D7≠≠Cst̅/u1D43E.sts|threeCsts⎦⎥⎤/u1D446.st|threeCsts
  , 
where |u1D43∆|oneCst, |u1D43∆|twoCst, |u1D43∆|threeCst, |u1D446|oneCst, |u1D446|twoCst, and |u1D446|threeCst are viscoplastic parameters. 
c)  VISPL = 3 .  The evolution equation is 
|u1D7≠≠̅̇= |parenleftCvJmax (|u1D4J3 , 0)
|u1D43∆|oneCst|parenriµhtCvJ/u1D446.st|oneCsts
(|u1D7≠≠̅+ |u1D43∆|twoCst)/u1D446.st|twoCsts 
where |u1D43∆|oneCst, |u1D43∆|twoCst, |u1D446|oneCst, and |u1D446|twoCst are viscoplastic parameters. 
4.  Kinematic Hardening.   The back stress is calculated similar to the Cauc hy 
stress above but without the softening factors: 
β=|u1D7≠7|u1D4JDCst
3/u1D4:D/radical.v1/u1D441
Λ|u1D4J≠Cst/u1D4:F−|oneCst

3/u1D4:C|u1D4JDCst/u1D402|u1D4JDCst−|oneCst|parenriµhtCvJ  . 
|u1D7≠7|u1D4JDCst is a hardening material parameter (PMU).  The tota l Piola-Kirchhoﬀ stress is 
now given by /u1D412∗=/u1D412−β and the total stress is given by a standard push f or- 
ward operation with the elastic deformation gradien t.

This is material type 269. This is a rubber model b ased on the Arruda and Boyce (1993) 
chain model accompanied with a viscoelastic contrib ution according to Bergström and

entangled chain in an embedded polymer gel matrix a nd the implementation is based

POSTV Deﬁne additional history variables that might  be useful for post-
processing.  See remarks below for details. 
Remarks: 
1.  Material birth.   This material is initially in a quiet state, some times referred to 
as a ghost material.  In this state the material ha s the thermo-elastic properties 
deﬁned by the quiet Young’s modulus, quiet Poisson’ s ratio and quiet thermal 
expansion coeﬃcient.  These should represent void, i.e., the Young’s modulus 
should be small enough to not inﬂuence the surround ings but large enough to 
avoid numerical problems.  A quiet material stress should never reach the 
yield point.  When the temperature reaches the birt h temperature, a history 
variable representing the indicator of the welding material is incremented.  
This variable follows 
|u1D6F∆(|u1D461) = min |parenleftCv61, max |<racketleftCv60,|u1D447max − |u1D447|u1D4J9Cststart 
|u1D447|u1D4J9Cstend − |u1D447|u1D4J9Cststart |<racketriµhtCv6|parenriµhtCv6 
where |u1D447max = max 
|u1D46≠Cst≤|u1D461Cst|u1D447(|u1D46≠) . This parameter is available as history variable 9  in the 
output database.  The eﬀective thermo-elastic mater ial properties are interpo- 
lated as 
|u1D438 = |u1D438(|u1D447)|u1D6F∆ + |u1D438quiet (1 − |u1D6F∆) 
/u1D̅08=/u1D̅08(|u1D447)|u1D6F∆ +/u1D̅08quiet (1 − |u1D6F∆) 
|u1D6F+ = |u1D6F+(|u1D447, |u1D447max )|u1D6F∆ + |u1D6F+quiet (1 − |u1D6F∆)  
where |u1D438, /u1D̅08, and |u1D6F+ are the Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio and therma l expan- 
sion coeﬃcient, respectively.  Here, the thermal ex pansion coeﬃcient is either a 
temperature dependent curve, or a collection of tem perature dependent 
curves, ordered in a table according to maximum tem perature |u1D447max .  
2.  Stress Update.   The stress update follows a classical isotropic a ssociative 
thermo-elastic-plastic approach with kinematic hard ening that is summarized 
in the following.  The explicit temperature depende nce is sometimes dropped 
for the sake of clarity.  
 
The stress evolution is given as 
σ̇=/u1D402|parenleftCv2ε̇−ε̇|u1D4JDCst−ε̇|u1D447Cst|parenriµhtCv2 *MAT_CWM  *MAT_270  
 where /u1D402 is the eﬀective elastic constitutive tensor and 
 
ε̇|u1D447Cst= |u1D6F+|u1D447̇/u1D408 
ε̇|u1D4JDCst= |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst3
2/u1D42C−κ
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt 
are the thermal and plastic strain rates, respectiv ely.  The latter expression in- 
cludes the deviatoric stress  
/u1D42C=/u1D6D4−1
3Tr (/u1D6D4)/u1D408, 
the back stress κ and the eﬀective stress 
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt=/radical.v53
2(/u1D42C−κ):(/u1D42C−κ) 
that are involved in the plastic equations.  To thi s end, the eﬀective yield stress 
is given as 
|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st= |u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st(|u1D447) + |u1D6FD /u1D4:B (|u1D447)|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst 
and plastic strains evolve when the eﬀective stress  exceeds this value.  The 
back stress evolves as 
κ̇= (1 − |u1D6FD)/u1D4:B(|u1D447)|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst/u1D42C−κ
|u1D7≠∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rt 
where |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst is the rate of eﬀective plastic strain that follow s from consistency 
equations. 
3.  Annealing.   When the temperature reaches the start annealing temperature, 
the material starts assuming its virgin properties.   Beyond the start annealing 
temperature it behaves as an ideal elastic-plastic material but with no evolution 
of plastic strains.  The resetting of eﬀective plas tic properties in the annealing 
temperature interval is done by modifying the eﬀect ive plastic strain and back 
stress before the stress update as 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst= |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst|u1D4JBCstmax |<racketleftCv60, min |parenleftCv61,|u1D447 − |u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend 
|u1D447|u1D44∆Cststart − |u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend |parenriµhtCv6|<racketriµhtCv6 
κ|u1D4JBCst+|oneCst=κ|u1D4JBCstmax |<racketleftCv60, min |parenleftCv61,|u1D447 − |u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend 
|u1D447|u1D44∆Cststart − |u1D447|u1D44∆Cstend |parenriµhtCv6|<racketriµhtCv6 
 
Depending on the choice for parameter ANOPT, anneal ing may also aﬀect the 
thermal expansion of the structure.  A cut-oﬀ tempe rature can be deﬁned for 
the evaluation of the thermal expansion.  Above thi s temperature limit, further 
expansion is suppressed.  The cut-oﬀ temperature do es not necessarily coin- 
cide with the annealing temperature. 
4.  Average temperature rate.   The optional Card 3 is used to set history variab le 
11, which is the average temperature rate by which the temperature has gone 
from T2PHASE to T1PHASE. To fringe this variable th e range should be set to 
positive values since it is during the simulation t emporarily used to store the 
time when the material has reached temperature T2PH ASE and is then stored *MAT_270  *MAT_CWM  
 as a negative value.  A strictly positive value mea ns that the material has 
reached temperature T2PHASE and gone down to T1PHAS E and the history 
variable is (T2P H ASE − T1P H ASE) (T1 − T2) ⁄ , where T2 is the time when 
temperature T2PHASE is reached and T1 is the time w hen temperature 
T1PHASE is reached.  Note that T2P H ASE > T1P H ASE  and T1 > T2 . A value 
of zero means that the element has not yet reached temperature T2PHASE. A 
strictly negative value means that the element has reached temperature 
T2PHASE but not yet T1PHASE. 
5.  History variables.   This material formulation outputs additional data  for post-
processing to the set of history variables if reque sted by the user.  The parame- 
ter POSTV deﬁnes the data to be written.  Its value  is calculated as 
POST V = a|oneCst+ 2 |u1D44∆|twoCst+ 4 |u1D44∆|threeCst+8 |u1D44∆|fourCst 
Each ﬂag  |u1D44∆|u1D4J6Cst is a binary (can be either 1 or 0) and corresponds  to one particular 
post-processing variable according to the following  table. 
 
 
Flag Description Variables # hist 
|u1D44∆|oneCst Accumulated thermal strain  |u1D7≠≠|u1D447Cst 1 
|u1D44∆|twoCst Accumulated strain tensor  /u1D6C6 6 
|u1D44∆|threeCst Plastic strain tensor  /u1D6C6|u1D4JDCst 6 
|u1D44∆|fourCst Equivalent strain  |u1D7≠≠/V.st/M.st   1 
 
The above table also shows the order of output as w ell as the number of extra history 
variables associated with the particular ﬂag. The v alues of these user-deﬁned histories 
are reset when the temperature is in the annealing range. 
 
In total NXH extra variables are required depending  on the choice of parameter POSTV. 
For example, the maximum number of additional varia bles is NXH  =  14 for 
POSTV  =  15. 
 
A complete list of history variables for the materi al is given in the following table.  
“Position” refers to the history variable number as  listed by LS-PrePost when post-
processing the d3plot database.  The variable NEIPS  in *DATABASE_EXTENT_BINA-

Remarks: 
This model is intended to be used in two stages.  D uring the ﬁrst step the compaction of 
a powder specimen is simulated after which the resu lts are dumped to ﬁle, and in a 
subsequent step the model is restarted for simulati ng sintering of the compacted 
specimen.  In the following, an overview of the two  diﬀerent models is given, for a 
detailed description we refer to Brandt (1998).  Th e progressive stiﬀening in the material 
during compaction makes it more or less necessary t o run double precision and with 
constraint contacts to avoid instabilities, unfortu nately this currently limits the use of 
this material to the smp version of LS-DYNA. 
 
The powder compaction model makes use of a multipli cative split of the deformation 
gradient into a plastic and elastic part according to 
/u1D405=/u1D405|u1D4J2Cst/u1D405|u1D4JDCst  , 
where the plastic deformation gradient maps the ini tial reference conﬁguration to an 
intermediate relaxed conﬁguration 
|u1D6FF/u1D431̃=/u1D405|u1D4JDCst|u1D6FF/u1D41ℜ 
and subsequently the elastic part maps this onto th e current loaded conﬁguration 
|u1D6FF/u1D431=/u1D405|u1D4J2Cst|u1D6FF/u1D431̃  . 
The compactness tensor, /u1D40F, then maps the intermediate conﬁguration onto a vi rtual 
fully compacted conﬁguration 
|u1D6FF/u1D431̅=/u1D40F|u1D6FF/u1D431̃ 
and we deﬁne the relative density as 
|u1D4J1 = det /u1D40F=|u1D7≠+
|u1D7≠+̅  , 
where |u1D7≠+ and |u1D7≠+̅ denote the current and fully compacted density, re spectively.  The elastic 
properties depend highly on the relative density th rough the bulk modulus |u1D43∆(|u1D4J1) , but 
the Poisson’s ratio is assumed constant.

The sintering model is a thermo and viscoelastic mo del where the evolution of the mean

Remarks: 
In the RHT model, the shear and pressure part is co upled in which the pressure is 
described by the Mie-Gruneisen form with a polynomi al Hugoniot curve and a |u1D4JD-|u1D6F+ 
compaction relation.  For the compaction model, we deﬁne a history variable 
representing the porosity |u1D6F+ that is initialized to |u1D6F+|zeroCst> 1. This variable represents the 
current fraction of density between the matrix mate rial and the porous concrete and 
will decrease with increasing pressure, that is, th e reference density is expressed as |u1D6F+|u1D7≠+ . 
The evolution of this variable is given as *MAT_272  *MAT_RHT

where |u1D4JD(|u1D461) indicates the pressure at time |u1D461. This expression also involves the initial pore

we deﬁne the cap pressure, or current pore crush pr essure, as

For the shear strength description we use  
|u1D4JD∗=|u1D4JD
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst    
as the pressure normalized with the compressive str ength parameter.  We also use /u1D42C to 
denote the deviatoric stress tensor and |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst the plastic strain rate.  The eﬀective plastic 
strain is thus denoted ε|u1D4JDCst and can be viewed as such in the post processor of  choice. 
 
For a given stress state and rate of loading, the e lastic-plastic yield surface for the RHT 
model is given by 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst(|u1D4JD∗,/u1D42C, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst∗) = |u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D7≠∆|u1D466Cst∗(|u1D4JD∗, |u1D439|u1D4JFCst(|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst, |u1D4JD∗), |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JDCst∗)|u1D44J|threeCst(/u1D̅0:, |u1D4JD∗)

Plastic ﬂow occurs in the direction of deviatoric s tress, meaning  
ε̇|u1D4JDCst~/u1D42C  , 
but for tension there is an option to set the param eter PFC to a number corresponding 
to the inﬂuence of plastic volumetric strain.  If |u1D7≠6 ≤ 1  is used to denote this parameter, 
then for the special case of |u1D7≠6 = 1  
ε̇|u1D4JDCst~/u1D42C− |u1D4JD/u1D408  . *MAT_272  *MAT_RHT  
 This was introduced to reduce noise in tension that  was observed on some test 
problems.  A failure strain can be used to erode el ements with severe deformation 
which by default is set to 200%. 
 
For simplicity, automatic generation of material pa rameters is available using ONEM-
PA < 0; no other parameters are needed.  If FC = 0 then the 35 MPa strength concrete in 
Riedel (2004) is generated in the units speciﬁed by  the value of ONEMPA. For FC > 0 
FC then speciﬁes the actual strength of the concret e in the units speciﬁed by the value of 
ONEMPA. The other parameters are generated by inter polating between the 35 MPa 
and 140 MPa strength concretes as presented in Ried el (2004).  Any automatically 
generated parameter may be overridden by the user; one of these parameters may be 
the initial porosity ALPHA0 of the concrete.

This is material type 273. CDPM is a damage plastic  concrete model based on work 
published in Grassl et al.  (2011, 2013) and Grassl  and Jirásek (2006).  This model is 
aimed to simulations where failure of concrete stru ctures subjected to dynamic loadings 
is sought.  It describes the characterization of th e failure process subjected to multi-axial 
and rate-dependent loading.  The model is based on eﬀective stress plasticity and with a 
damage model based on both plastic and elastic stra in measures.  This material model is 
available only for solids. 
 
There are a lot of parameters for the advanced user  but note that most of them have 
default values that are based on experimental tests .  They might not be useful for all 
types of concrete and all types of load paths but t hey are values that can be used as a 
good starting point.  If the default values are not  good enough the theory chapter at the 
end of the parameter description can be of use.

The variable ℎ is a mesh-dependent measure used to convert strain s to displacements.  
The variable  |u1D7≠≠|u1D461 is called the inelastic tensile strain and is deﬁn ed as the sum of the 
irreversible plastic strain |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JD and the reversible strain |u1D464|u1D461|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ − |u1D7≠≠ |u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv2 (in compression 
|u1D464/u1D450|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠≠ − |u1D7≠≠ |u1D4JD|parenriµhtCv2). To get the inﬂuence of multi-axial stress states  on the softening a damage 
ductility measure |u1D46J|u1D46≠ is added: 
|u1D46J|u1D46≠= 1 + |parenleftCv1|u1D434|u1D46≠− 1|parenriµhtCv1|u1D44J|u1D46≠|u1D43J|u1D46≠

The inelastic strain is then modiﬁed according: 
|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6=|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6
|u1D46J|u1D46≠ 
Compressive damage is controlled by an exponential stress-inelastic strain law.  Stress 
value /u1D48ℜ/u1D484 and inelastic strain /u1D̅:A/u1D48ℜ/u1D484 need to be speciﬁed, see ﬁgure below how the stres s 
softening is controlled by the input parameters.  A  small value of /u1D̅:A/u1D48ℜ/u1D484, i.e. 1.0E-4

 Strain rate: 
Concrete is strongly rate dependent.  If the loadin g rate is increased, the tensile and 
compressive strength increase and are more prominen t in tension then in compression.  
The dependency is taken into account by an addition al variable |u1D6F+|u1D4JF≥ 1. The rate 
dependency is included by scaling both the equivale nt strain rate and the inelastic 
strain.  The rate parameter is deﬁned by 
|u1D6F+|u1D4JF= (1 −/u1D44Bcompression ) |u1D6F+|u1D4JF|u1D461 +/u1D44Bcompression |u1D6F+|u1D4JF /u1D450 
Where /u1D44Bcompression  is continuous compression measure (= 1 means only compression, = 0 
means only tension) and for tension we have 
|u1D6F+|u1D4JF|u1D461 =

For shell elements, |u1D437|threeCst|threeCst |u1D4JDCst= 0, and only two yield surfaces are present: the in-

This is Material Type 275, a smooth viscoelastic vi scoplastic model based on the works 
of Hollenstein et.al.  [2013, 2014] and Jabareen [2 015].  The stress response is 
rheologically represented by HJR (Hollenstein-Jabar een-Rubin) elements in parallel (see 
Figure 0-1 ), where each element exhibits combinations of visc oelastic and viscoplastic 
characteristics.  The model is based on large displ acement hyper-elastoplasticity and the 
numerical implementation is strongly objective; thi s together with the smooth 
characteristics makes it especially suitable for im plicit analysis.

The Cauchy stress for this smooth viscoelastic visc oplastic material is given by

|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst   , 
where |u1D43∆ is the elastic bulk modulus provided on the ﬁrst c ard and /u1D4:D= det(/u1D405) is the 
relative volume with /u1D46D being the total deformation gradient.  The deviato ric stresses, /u1D4∫4|u1D4J6Cst, 
are coming from the HJR (Hollenstein-Jabareen-Rubin)  elements in parallel.  Up to 6 such 
elements can be deﬁned for the deviatoric response and a rheological representation of 
one is shown in Figure 0-1 . Each element is associated with 8 material parame ters that 
are provided on the optional cards and characterize  its inelastic response.  All this 
allows for a wide range of stress strain relationsh ips.  The critical part involves 
estimating parameters for a given test suite.  Some  elaboration on the physical 
interpretation of the individual parameters in the context of uniaxial stress is given 
following a general description of the model.

each inelastic material parameter individually; the  material parameters above are input 
on the HJR element cards as A0, B0, A1, B1 and KAPA S. 
 
A Maxwell material is obtained by providing an elem ent with a nonzero |u1D44∆|zeroCst (A0) and 
with other parameters set to zero.  This parameter should be interpreted as the 
viscoelastic relaxation coeﬃcient determining the r ate at which the stress relaxes to zero 
(see parameter BETA in *MAT_VISCOELASTIC).  In Figure M275-1  a stress relaxation 
is shown for a strain controlled problem using two HJR elements and normalized 
material parameters using a bulk modulus of |u1D43∆ = 1 . For the ﬁrst element |u1D43A = 0.5  and 
for the other |u1D43A = 1  while |u1D44∆|zeroCst varies; all other parameters are zero.  The engine ering strain 
is ramped to 50 %  from |u1D461 = 0  to |u1D461 = 1  and then kept constant.  The response is very 
similar to other viscoelastic models in LS-DYNA. No t surprisingly, a HJR element with 
|u1D44∆|zeroCst> 0 (and |u1D44∆|oneCst= |u1D44F|oneCst= 0) will always relax to zero stress, which follows f rom ( M275.1 ) 
and ( M275.2 ); thus the relaxed stress in this case comes from the purely elastic element.  
A general viscoelastic material can be obtained by putting several such HJR elements in 
parallel, in analogy to *MAT_GENERAL_VISCOELASTIC. -0.08-0.05-0.030.000.020.050.07

For a nonzero |u1D44F|zeroCst (B0) with other parameters set to zero, a rate ind ependent plastic 
response is obtained exhibiting zero yield stress, that is, inelastic strains develop 
immediately upon loading.  From ( M275.2 ) the value of |u1D44F|zeroCst determines the saturated 
stress value for the associated HJR element by ( M275.1 ) and 
|u1D44F̅= |parenleftCvJ|u1D44F|zeroCst±1

in tension ( +) and compression ( −), respectively.  A smooth response is obtained tha t is 
characterized by hysteresis as shown in Figure M275-2 . The same material parameters 
as in the previous example are used with the except ion of varying |u1D44F|zeroCst instead of |u1D44∆|zeroCst. The 
deformation is controlled by a cyclic Cauchy stress  between −0.25  and 0.25 ; for larger |u1D44F|zeroCst 
a hysteresis is observed.  It should however be men tioned that the hysteresis vanishes 
as |u1D44F|zeroCst→∞  as the stress for the second element saturates qui ckly to a small value, so it is 
not trivial to quantitatively estimate the amount o f hysteresis for a given parameter 
setting and deformation. 
 
Rate independent plasticity with a nonzero yield st ress can be obtained by a nonzero |u1D44F|oneCst 
(B1) in combination with parameters /u1D̅05|zeroCst (KAPA0), /u1D̅05|u1D46≠Cst (KAPAS) and |u1D4JA (M).  The yield 
stress in the sense of von Mises is given by 
|u1D7≠∆/u1D44C.st= 2|u1D43A/u1D4:D−|oneCst/u1D̅05 
from which /u1D̅05 is interpreted as the current yield strain.  Here |u1D44F|oneCst determines the amount 
of overstress through ( M275.1 ) and ( M275.2 ), requiring the solution of a non-trivial -0.08-0.05-0.030.000.020.050.07

and down to 0 and |u1D44F|oneCst is varied with all other parameters zero; the resp onse tends to an

Isotropic strain hardening ( /u1D̅05|u1D46≠Cst>/u1D̅05|zeroCst) or softening ( /u1D̅05|u1D46≠Cst</u1D̅05|zeroCst) is obtained with |u1D4JA > 0 ; /u1D̅05 
tends exponentially towards /u1D̅05|u1D46≠Cst at a rate determined by |u1D4JA. Using |u1D44F|oneCst= 1000  (meaning 
very little overstress), /u1D̅05|zeroCst= 0.02 , and /u1D̅05|u1D46≠Cst= 0.01  while varying |u1D4JA, the softening response 
in Figure M275-4  is obtained.  The rate at which the element harden s is diﬃcult to 
quantitatively estimate, but presumably it depends not only on |u1D4JA but also on |u1D44F|oneCst. It is 
important to note however that for small to moderat e |u1D44F|oneCst the model appears to harden 
with |u1D4JA = 0 , which is due to larger overstress.  The hardening  determined by |u1D4JA can be 
determined from a loading, unloading and reloading cycle to detect how the the yield 
strain /u1D̅05 changes; see Hollenstein et.al.  [2013]. 
 
Finally, |u1D44∆|oneCst (A1) is the viscoplastic parameter determining how  stress responds to change 
in strain rate.  Its interpretation is very similar  to that of |u1D44∆|zeroCst; stress increases with 
increasing loading rate and relaxes to the saturate d stress value given by ( M275.1 ) and 
(M275.2 ). In Figure M275-5  a rate dependency is illustrated for |u1D43∆ = 1 , |u1D43A = 1.5 , /u1D̅05|zeroCst=/u1D̅05|u1D46≠Cst=-0.075-0.050-0.0250.0000.0250.0500.0750.1000.125

varies from 0.2 to 20 and for small strain rates ( M275.3 ) can be used for estimating the 
saturated stress, but in general ( M275.2 ) must be used. 
 
Putting several HJR elements in parallel can thus p rovide a fairly general combination 
of viscoelastic/viscoplastic response with isotropi c hardening/softening, but this of 
course requires a rich test suite and a good way of  estimating the material parameters.  
Presumably it is often suﬃcient to neglect some eﬀe cts and work with only a subset of 
the material parameters.

This is Material Type 276.  This material model pro vides a general viscoelastic Maxwell 
model having up to 6 terms in the Prony series expa nsion and is useful for modeling 
dense continuum rubbers and solid explosives.  It i s similar to Material Type 76 but 
allows the incorporation of aging eﬀects on the mat erial properties.  Either the 
coeﬃcients of the Prony series expansion or a relax ation curve may be speciﬁed to

Remarks: 
The Cauchy stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst , is related to the strain rate by  
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst (|u1D461) = −|u1D4JD|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst +/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (/u1D̅0F)

|zeroCst 
For this model, it is postulated that the mathemati cal form is preserved in the 
constitutive equation for aging; however two new ma terial functions, |u1D4J4|zeroCst|minuteCst(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) and |u1D4J4|oneCst|minuteCst(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst, |u1D461) 
are introduced to replace |u1D4J4|zeroCst and |u1D4J4|oneCst(|u1D461), which is expressed in terms of a Prony series as 
in material model 76, *MAT_GENERAL_VISCOELASTIC.  T he aging time is denoted 
by |u1D461|u1D44∆Cst. 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst (|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst, |u1D461) = −|u1D4JD|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst +/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst |minuteCst(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst, |u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (/u1D̅0F)
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst 
where 
|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst |minuteCst(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst, |u1D461) = |u1D6F+(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst)|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst |<racketleftCv1|u1D6FD(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst)|u1D461|<racketriµhtCv1  . 
Here |u1D6F+(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) and |u1D6FD(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) are two new material properties that are functions  of the aging 
time |u1D461|u1D44∆Cst.  The material properties functions |u1D6F+(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) and |u1D6FD(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) will be determined using 
experimental results.  For determination of |u1D6F+(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) and |u1D6FD(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst), the above equations can be 
written in the following form 
log|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst − |u1D4JD|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenriµhtCv2|u1D461Cst|u1D44∆Csts/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D461Cst= log |u1D6F+(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) + log|parenleftCv2|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst − |u1D4JD|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenriµhtCv2|u1D461Cst|u1D44∆Csts=|zeroCst/co⋯⋯a.st|u1D461Cst→/u1Dℜ09.st
log /u1D̅0∫= log |u1D6FD(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) + log |u1D461 
Therefore, if one plots the stress as a function of  time on log-log scales, with the vertical 
axis being the stress and the horizontal axis being  the time, then the stress-relaxation 
curve for any aged time history can be obtained dir ectly from the stress-relaxation curve 
at |u1D461|u1D44∆Cst= 0 by imposing a vertical shift and a horizontal shif t on the stress-relaxation 
curves.  The vertical shift and the horizontal shif t are log |u1D6F+(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) and log |u1D6FD(|u1D461|u1D44∆Cst) respectively. *MAT_277  *MAT_ADHESIVE_CURING_VISCOELASTIC

This is Material Type 277.  It is useful for modeli ng adhesive materials during chemical 
curing.  This material model provides a general vis coelastic Maxwell model having up 
to 16 terms in the Prony series expansion.  It is s imilar to Material Type 76, but the 
viscoelastic properties not only depend on the temp erature but also on an internal 
variable representing the state of cure for the adh esive.  The kinematics of the curing 
process depend on temperature as well as on tempera ture rate and follow the Kamal 
model.

Remarks:  
1.  Material Formulation.  Within this material formulation an internal varia ble |u1D6F+ 
has been included to represent the degree of cure f or the adhesive.  The evolu- 
tion equation for this variable is given by the Kam al model and reads 
d|u1D6F+
dt = |parenleftCv4/u1D458|oneCst exp |parenleftCv4−/u1D450|oneCst
|u1D44J|u1D447 |parenriµhtCv4 +/u1D458|twoCst exp |parenleftCv4−/u1D450|twoCst
|u1D44J|u1D447 |parenriµhtCv4 |u1D6F+|u1D4JACst|parenriµhtCv4 (1 − |u1D6F+)|u1D4JBCst  . 
The chemical reaction of the curing process results  in a shrinkage of the mate- 
rial.  The coeﬃcient of the chemical shrinkage |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+)  can either be given by a 
load curve or by using the quadratic expression  *MAT_ADHESIVE_CURING_VISCOELASTIC  *MAT_277  
 |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+) = |u1D6F∆|twoCst|u1D6F+|twoCst+ |u1D6F∆|oneCst|u1D6F+ + |u1D6F∆|zeroCst  . 
For positive values of the parameter LCCHEXP, a diﬀ erential form is used to 
compute the chemical strains: 
|u1D4J1|u1D7≠≠ ch = |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+)|u1D4J1|u1D6F+  . 
Otherwise a secant form deﬁnes the strains: 
|u1D7≠≠ch = |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+)(|u1D6F+ − |u1D6F+|zeroCst) − |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+/u1D4:C.st)(|u1D6F+/u1D4:C.st− |u1D6F+|zeroCst)  . 
Consequently, the deﬁnition of |u1D6F∆(|u1D6F+)  as quadratic expression goes along the 
secant formulation. 
Analogously, the thermal strains are either deﬁned in a secant or diﬀerential 
form, depending on the load curve parameter LCTHEXP . For positive values 
of that parameter , the diﬀerential form is applied, otherwise the sec ant form is 
used.  For the latter the reference temperature |u1D447|zeroCst is identiﬁed with the input 
parameter TREFEXP. In both cases the coeﬃcient of t hermal expansion can be 
given as table depending on degree of cure and temp erature. 
Finally, the Cauchy stress, |u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6 /u1D45̅, is related to the strain rate by  
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst (|u1D461) =/integral.v:|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F)∂|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J9Cst (/u1D̅0F)
∂/u1D̅0F|u1D4J1 /u1D̅0F |u1D461Cst
|zeroCst  . 
The relaxation functions |u1D4J4|u1D4J6 /u1D45̅/u1D458/u1D45∫(|u1D461 −/u1D̅0F) are represented in this material formulation 
by up to 16 terms (not including the instantaneous modulus |u1D43A0) of the Prony 
series: 
g(|u1D461, |u1D6F+) = |u1D43A|zeroCst(|u1D6F+) − |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D6F+)
|u1D4J6Cst+ |summationCv1 |u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D6F+)
|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts|u1D461Cst  . 
For the sake of simplicity, a constant ratio |u1D43A|u1D4J6(|u1D6F+)|u1D43A0(|u1D6F+) ⁄ for all degrees of cure is 
assumed.  Consequently, it suﬃces to deﬁne one term  |u1D43A0(|u1D6F+) as a function of the 
degree of cure and further coeﬃcients for the fully  cured state of the adhesive: 
g(|u1D461, |u1D6F+) = |u1D43A|zeroCst(|u1D6F+)
⎝⎜⎜⎛1 − |summationCv1|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst/co⋯⋯a.st/u1D6FC.st=|oneCst/period.st|zeroCst
|u1D43A|zeroCst/co⋯⋯a.st/u1D6FC.st=|oneCst/period.st|zeroCst |u1D4J6Cst|parenleftCv21 − |u1D4J2−/u1D6FD.st|u1D4J6Csts|u1D461Cst|parenriµhtCv2
⎠⎟⎟⎞  . 
2.  Temperature Effect on the Stress Relaxation.  A possible temperature eﬀect 
on the stress relaxation (see Remark 1 ) is accounted for by the Williams-
Landel-Ferry (WLF) shift function or the Arrhenius shift function.  For details 
on this function, please see material formulation 7 6, *MAT_GENERAL_VIS-
COELASTIC. If all three values (WLFTREF, WLFA, and WLFB) are nonzero, 
the WLF function is used; the Arrhenius function is  used if WLFB is zero; and 
no scaling is applied if all three values are zero.*MAT_278  *MAT_CF_MICROMECHANICS

In this elastoplastic cohesive material the normal and tangential directions are treated 
separately, but can be connected by expressing the in-plane traction parameters as 
functions of the normal traction.  In the normal di rection the material uses diﬀerent 
models in tension and compression.

Tangential traction: 
Assume the total separation is an additive split of  the elastic and plastic separation in 
each in-plane direction 
|u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst= |u1D6FF|u1D4J2Cst|u1D4J6Cst+ |u1D6FF|u1D4JDCst|u1D4J6Cst, |u1D4J6 = 1,2.

  VARIABLE   DESCRIPTION  
AT Tensile damage evolution parameter |u1D6F+|u1D461Cst. Can be interpreted as the 
residual load carrying capacity ratio for tensile f ailure ranging 
from 0 to 1. 
BT Tensile damage evolution parameter, |u1D6FD|u1D461Cst. It controls the softening 
velocity for tensile failure. 
AC Compressive damage evolution parameter, |u1D6F+|u1D4J≠Cst. Can be interpreted 
as the residual load carrying capacity ratio for co mpressive failure 
ranging from 0 to 1. 
BC Compressive damage evolution parameter |u1D6FD|u1D4J≠Cst. It controls the 
softening velocity for compressive failure. 
FTSCL Scale factor for the tensile strength (defaul t = 1.0): 
FT mod = FTSCL × FT 
If RATENL = 0.0 (see Card 4), then the tensile strength drops to 
its original value, FT, as soon as the ﬁrst crack h appens in the 
associated part.  In this case, FTSCL > 1.0 can be helpful to model 
high force peaks in impact events. 
 
If RATENL ≠ 0.0, then, when a crack forms in a neighboring 
element, the tensile strength for an element is eva luated 
depending on the smoothed eﬀective strain rate (see  Remark 7 ).   
SFSTI Scale factor for stiﬀness after failure.  For  example, SFSTI = 0.001 
means that stiﬀness is reduced to 0.1% of the elast ic stiﬀness at 
failure. 
SFSTR Scale factor for stress in case of failure.  For example, SF-
STR = 0.01 means that stress is reduced to 1% of the fail ure stress 
at failure. 
ICRIN Flag for crack strain initialization: 
EQ.0.0: initial crack strain is strain at failure (default) . 
EQ.1.0: initial crack strain is zero.

Remarks: 
1.  Plane Stress Failure Criteria.  The underlying material behavior before 
failure is isotropic, small strain linear elasticit y with Young’s modulus, |u1D438, and 
Poisson’s ratio, /u1D̅08. Asymmetric (tension-compression dependent) failur e hap- 
pens as soon as one of the following plane stress f ailure criteria is violated. 
a)  Rankine Maximum Stress.   For FMOD = 0, a maximum stress criterion 
(Rankine) is used where principal stresses, |u1D7≠∆|oneCst and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst, are bound by tensile 
strength, |u1D4J3|u1D461Cst, and compressive strength, |u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst, as follows: 
−|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst<{|u1D7≠∆|oneCst, |u1D7≠∆|twoCst}< |u1D4J3|u1D461Cst 
b)  Mohr-Coulomb.   With FMOD = 1, the Mohr-Coulomb criterion with ex - 
pressions in four diﬀerent categories is used: 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst> 0 and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst> 0:  max |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠∆|oneCst
|u1D4J3|u1D461Cst,|u1D7≠∆|twoCst
|u1D4J3|u1D461Cst|parenriµhtCvJ < 1
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst< 0 and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst< 0:             max |parenleftCvJ−|u1D7≠∆|oneCst
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst, −|u1D7≠∆|twoCst
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|parenriµhtCvJ < 1
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst> 0 and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst< 0:  |u1D7≠∆|oneCst
|u1D4J3|u1D461Cst−|u1D7≠∆|twoCst
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst< 1
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst< 0 and |u1D7≠∆|twoCst> 0: −|u1D7≠∆|oneCst
|u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst+|u1D7≠∆|twoCst
|u1D4J3|u1D461Cst< 1 
c)  Drucker-Prager.   For FMOD = 2, the plane stress Drucker-Prager cri terion 
is given by: *MAT_280  *MAT_GLASS

The modiﬁed versions, FMOD = 10, 11, 12, change wha t is considered tensile 
and compressive failure.  The form of the failure s tays the same for each type.  
In each case, a line with slope − |u1D4J3|u1D4J≠Cst|u1D4J3|u1D461Cst⁄ distinguishes the diﬀerence between the 
two types of failure.  See Figure M280-1  for an example of how the tensile and 
compressive failure are modiﬁed for the Rankine fai lure criterion. 
2.  Crack Formation.   As soon as failure happens in the tensile regime,  a crack 
occurs perpendicular to the maximum principal stres s direction.  That means a 
crack coordinate system is set up and stored, deﬁne d by a relative angle with 
respect to the element coordinate system.  Appropri ate stress and stiﬀness ten- 
sor components (e.g. normal to the crack) are reduc ed according to SFSTR and 
SFSTI if IMOD = 0. The stress reduction takes place  in a period of NCYCR time 
step cycles.  For IMOD = 1.0 the stress and stiﬀnes s tensor are reduced by a 
damage model (see Remark 5 ). A second crack orthogonal to the ﬁrst crack is 
possible which can open and close independently fro m the ﬁrst one, further 
reducing the element stiﬀness. 
3.  Crack Closure.   To deal with crack closure, the current strain in  principal 
stress direction is stored as initial crack strain (ICRIN = 0, default) or the initial 
crack strain is set to zero (ICRIN = 1).  After fai lure, the crack strain is tracked, 
so that later crack closure will be detected.  If t hat is the case, appropriate stress 
and stiﬀness tensor components (e.g. compressive) a re reactivated so that e.g. 
under pressure a load could be carried and cause a nonzero stress perpendicu- 
lar to the crack. /g11/g12

failure criterion does not change but what is consider ed compressive failure is 
modiﬁed. *MAT_GLASS  *MAT_280  
 4.  Number of Failed Integration Points.   If the critical number of failed 
integration points (NIPF) in one element is reached , all integration points over 
the element thickness fail as well.  The default va lue of NIPF=1 resembles the 
fact, that a crack in a glass plate immediately run s through the thickness. 
5.  Damage Model.   Starting with the release of LS-DYNA version R10,  a damage 
model for stress and stiﬀness softening can be acti vated with IMOD = 1. The 
corresponding evolution law for ILAW = 0 is given b y: 
|u1D437 =
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧ 0 for /u1D̅05≤/u1D̅05|zeroCst
1 −/u1D̅05|zeroCst

meaning tensile and compressive failure are treated  in the same fashion.  
However, with ILAW = 1 the damage evolution for ten sile failure is given by: 
|u1D437 =
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧ 0 for /u1D̅05≤/u1D̅05|zeroCst
1 −/u1D̅05|zeroCst

while damage for compressive failure evolves as (mo re delayed stress reduc- 
tion): 
|u1D437 =
⎩|<raceleftCex⎨|<raceleftCex⎧ 0 for /u1D̅05≤/u1D̅05|zeroCst
1 −/u1D̅05|zeroCst

6.  Nonlocal Failure.   A nonlocal failure criterion which is mainly inte nded for 
windshield impact can be deﬁned using ENGCRT and RA DCRT. The same 
procedure is used as in *MAT_ADD_EROSION; see Remark 1i  there. 
7.  Strain Rate Dependent, Nonlocal Tensile Strength. If RATENL > 0.0, all 
elements in the appropriate part are initialized wi th a tensile strength of 
FTSCL × FT . If one integration point in an element fails, the n the tensile 
strength in the neighboring elements is set to FT /tilℂecomb.h4 where

Remarks: 
1.  Material Model.   The total strain |u1D7≠≠ is composed of elastic strain |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J2Cst and 
martensite strain |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JACst according to the additive split 
|u1D7≠≠ = |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J2Cst+ |u1D7≠6|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JACst  , 
where 0 ≤ |u1D7≠6 ≤ 1  is the volume fraction of martensite.  Initially, the material is 
only composed of austenite, that is, |u1D7≠6 = 0 . The material is assumed to be iso- 
tropic elastic 
|u1D7≠∆ = |u1D436(|u1D7≠6):|u1D7≠≠|u1D4J2Cst  , 
and the martensite strain is assumed to be trace-fr ee 
tr(|u1D7≠≠|u1D4JACst) = 0  . 
Given the total strain |u1D7≠≠ and temperature |u1D447, this model ﬁnds |u1D7≠6 and  |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JACst that min- 
imize the mechanical energy 
/u1D448=/u1D44A+ |u1D437  , 
where /u1D44A is the Helmoltz’ free energy and |u1D437 is the dissipated energy.  The 
Helmoltz’ free energy is here given by 
/u1D44A(|u1D7≠≠, |u1D7≠6, |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JACst, |u1D447) =1

where 
|u1D714(|u1D447) = L H |u1D447 − TC 
TC   , 
/u1D450(|u1D7≠6) = |u1D7≠6⋅CPM + (1 − |u1D7≠6)⋅CPA  . 
The functions |u1D43A/u1D4:C.st and  |u1D43A/u1D446.st denote initiation energy and saturation energy, re - 
spectively, and are deﬁned as 
|u1D43A|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D46J) = K|u1D4J6 × max|parenleftCv1|u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst(|u1D46J), 0|parenriµhtCv1/M.st|u1D4J6Cst+|oneCst, |u1D4J6 =/u1D4:C, |u1D446, K|u1D4J6, M|u1D4J6 > 0, *MAT_SHAPE_MEMORY_ALLOY  *MAT_291  
 where the functions of |u1D4J4/u1D4:C.st and |u1D4J4/u1D446.st depends on the parameter ST Y PE . For nega- 
tive values of |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst, there will be no contribution to the free energy and |u1D4J4|u1D4J6Cst≤ 0 thus 
deﬁnes the set of admissible values for |u1D7≠6 and |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JACst. 
The function |u1D43A|u1D7≠6Cst denotes volume fraction energy and is deﬁned as 
|u1D43A|u1D7≠6Cst(|u1D7≠6) =KL × |u1D7≠6/M.st/L.st +|oneCst
ML + 1, KL, ML ≥ 0. 
Thus, the amount of stored energy in the system can  increase with increasing 
volume fraction.

In this model,  |u1D7≠6 and |u1D7≠≠|u1D4JACst can, however, evolve freely, and the evolution is in- 
stead postulated to satisfy the kinetic relations:

 2.  Transition Temperatures.   The initial (zero stress) austenite and martensit e 
start and ﬁnish temperatures, TMF ≤ TMS ≤ TAS ≤ TAF , can be given instead 
of the parameters TC , KL, and D0L . The temperatures are deﬁned as  
TMS = TC |parenleftCvJ1 −D0L 
L H |parenriµhtCvJ
TMF = TC |parenleftCvJ1 −D0L + KL 
L H |parenriµhtCvJ
TAS = TC |parenleftCvJ1 +D0L − KL 
L H |parenriµhtCvJ
  TAF = TC |parenleftCvJ1 +D0L 
L H |parenriµhtCvJ 
which gives

L H = 1 −TMF + TAS

KL, and D0L  are calculated as above, and their keyword values are ignored. 
3.  Heat Generation.   The internal energy is 
/u1D̅16=/u1D44A− |u1D7≠2|u1D447  , 
and the entropy is deﬁned as 
|u1D7≠2 = −|u1D71J /u1D44A 
|u1D71J|u1D447 = −|u1D7≠6L H 
TC +/u1D450(|u1D7≠6) |parenleftCvJ1 + ln |parenleftCvJ|u1D447
TC |parenriµhtCvJ|parenriµhtCvJ  . 
From the diﬀerential of /u1D44A, we have 
/u1D44Ȧ=  |u1D7≠∆:|u1D7≠≠̇− |u1D437 − |u1D7≠2|u1D447̇  , 
and thus 
/u1D̅16̇= |u1D7≠∆:|u1D7≠≠̇− |u1D437 − |u1D7≠2|u1D447̇− |parenleftCv1|u1D7≠2̇|u1D447 + |u1D7≠2|u1D447̇|parenriµhtCv1 = |u1D7≠∆:|u1D7≠≠̇− |u1D437 − |u1D7≠2̇|u1D447  . 
Combining this with the energy balance 
/u1D̅16̇= |u1D7≠∆:|u1D7≠≠̇+∇⋅(/u1D458∇|u1D447)  , 
we get 
/u1D450(|u1D7≠6)|u1D447̇=∇⋅(/u1D458∇|u1D447) + |u1D444  , 
with the volumetric heat generation rate 
|u1D444 = |u1D447L H 
TC |u1D7≠6̇− |u1D447/u1D450|minuteCst(|u1D7≠6)|u1D7≠6̇|parenleftCvJ1 + ln |parenleftCvJ|u1D447

This is  Material Type 293. This material models the behavio r of pre-impregnated 
(prepreg) composite ﬁbers during the high temperatu re preforming process.  In 
addition to providing stress and strain, it also pr ovides warp and weft yarn directions 
and stretch ratios after the forming process.  The major applications of the model are for 
materials used in light weight automobile parts.

Remarks: 
1.  Fiber and Resin Properties.   The dry ﬁber properties, EF3 and VF23, and the 
cure resin properties, EM and VM, are used to calcu late the through thickness 
elastic modulus of the prepreg using the rule of mi xture.  These properties will 
not aﬀect the in-plane deformation of the prepreg d uring the preforming 
simulation. 
2.  Shear Locking.   In most of the preforming cases, the angle betwee n the ﬁber 
yarns will not reach the shear locking state.  This  model is not designed for, 
and, therefore, not recommended for simulating shea r locking. 
3.  History Variables.  hsv1 represents the angle between warp/weft yarns,  and 
hsv2,3 are the stretch ratio of ﬁbers in 1,2 direct ions respectively. *MAT_293  *MAT_COMPRF  
 4.  BULK and G.   BULK and G are used by the contact algorithm.  Ch anging these 
parameters will not aﬀect the ﬁnal simulation resul t signiﬁcantly (but it may 
aﬀect the time step). 
5.  Model Description.   Woven composite prepregs are characterized using a 
non-orthogonal coordinate system having two princip al directions: one aligned 
with the longitudinal warp yarns and the other with  the transverse weft yarns.  
Prior to deformation the warp and weft yarns are or thogonal.  The directions 
and the ﬁber stretch ratios are determined from the  deformation gradient.  In 
Figure M293-1 , the angles |u1D6F+ and |u1D6FD refer to the relative of the rotation of the 
warp yarn coordinate to the local corotational |u1D46J coordinate and the angle be- 
tween the warp and weft yarns, respectively [2,3,4] .   
The stress from material deformation is divided int o two parts: (1) stress caused 
by the ﬁber stretch, /u1D6D4/u1D45:.st, as shown in Figure M293-1  (a); (2) stress caused by the 
ﬁber rotation, /u1D6D4|u1D4JACst, as shown in Figure M293-1  (b).  The total stress tensor, /u1D6D4, in 
the local corotational |u1D46J − |u1D466  coordinate system is the sum where the components 
are given below [3]:

6.  Material Property Characterization.   The non-orthogonal stress components 
caused by yarn stretch and rotation at various defo rmation states will be char- 
acterized via a set of experiments, which are uniax ial tension, bias-extension 
and cantilever beam bending tests.  All the tests n eed to be performed at the 
preforming temperature.  See references [1] and [3]  for more details. *MAT_COMPRF  *MAT_293  
 The uniaxial tension test is used to obtain the ﬁbe r direction undulation strains 
and the stable tensile moduli, together with the in -plane Poisson’s ratio (PR).  A 
typical test result is shown in Figure M293-2 .  From the stretch ratio-
engineering stress curve, the tensile modulus, ET, and the stretch ratio at the 
end of undulation, EPSILON, can be captured. 
The bias-extension test is used to characterize the  shear behavior of the compo- 
site needed for ﬁelds G12 |u1D4J6. The test procedure comes from the benchmark test 
literature [1].  An example of the bias-extension t est angle change-engineering 
stress curve is shown in Figure M293-3 . Undulation

 The angle change is calculated by using the equatio n [1]: 
|u1D6F∆ =/u1D̅0B
2− 2 cos −|oneCst|u1D437 + |u1D4J1
/radical.v12|u1D437 
where |u1D4J1 is the cross-head displacement and |u1D437 is the diﬀerence between the 
original height and the original width of the sampl e.  This equation holds only 
before the shear locking angle, speciﬁed in ﬁeld GA MMAL, which is measured 
directly at the end of the test, so the curve shoul d end when the ﬁber yarn angle 
reaches the shear locking state. 
The bending test should be performed to characteriz e the compression modulus 
along the yarn directions, as speciﬁed in the EC ﬁe ld.  The test setup is shown 
in Figure M293-4 .  The composite specimen is held in a clamp and de forms 
under its own gravity.  During the test, the compos ite is heated to the preform- 
ing temperature and the tip displacement is recorde d.  Due to the nonlinearity 
of the tensile modulus, the compression modulus is reversely calculated using a 
simulation: it is adjusted until the simulation lea ds to similar tip displacement 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.400.020.040.060.080.1

This is Material Type 295 which includes a collecti on of (nearly-in)compressible, 
(an)isotropic, hyperelastic  material models primarily aimed at describing the mechanical 
behavior of biological soft tissues.  Some of the m aterial models may also be used to 
analyze a wider class of materials including ﬁber-r einforced elastomers and stretchable 
fabrics. 
The constitutive laws are implemented in a modular fashion.  Each module may be 
invoked at most once, however, the order of modules  is interchangeable.  Each module 
may comprise of diﬀerent models.  Consequently, one  may easily change models in a 
module and include additional modules to account fo r more complex material behavior 
within the same keyword.  Extending an existing mod ule with a new model or even 
including a new module is straightforward and does not require a new material 
keyword.

elements only. 
EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with ma terial axes determined by 
vectors /u1D41A and /u1D41D input below, as with *DEFINE_COOR-
DINATE_VECTOR 
EQ.3.0: Locally orthotropic material axes determined by a 
vector /u1D42F and the normal vector to the plane of the ele- 
ment.  The plane of a solid element is the mi dsurface 
between the inner surface and outer surface deﬁned by 
the ﬁrst four nodes and the last four nodes of the con- 
nectivity of the element, respectively.  Thus, for solid 
elements, AOPT = 3 is only available for hexahedrons. 
/u1D41A is determined by taking the cross product of /u1D42F with 
the normal vector, /u1D41B is determined by taking the cross 
product of the normal vector with /u1D41A, and /u1D41C is the nor- 
mal vector.  Then /u1D41A and /u1D41B are rotated about /u1D41C by an an- 
gle BETA. BE TA may be set in the keyword input for 
the element or in the input for this keyword.  Note  that 
for solids, the material axes may be switched depen d-

fore or after applying BETA depending on MACF.  
EQ.4.0: Locally orthotropic in a cylindrical coordinate syst em

Remarks: 
1.  Volumetric Strain Energy Function.   The pure volumetric part of the strain 
energy function is deﬁned as part of the ISOtropic module. 
2.  Compressible and Nearly-Incompressible Models.  Depending on the sign 
of ITYPE and ATYPE, several formulations are availa ble.  Negative model 
numbers indicate that the corresponding part of the  strain energy function is 
considered isochoric.  Furthermore, the sign of FTY PE and INTYPE is directly 
linked to ATYPE.  For example, if ATYPE is negative , both ﬁber and ﬁber in- 
teraction models are in their isochoric form.  Cons equently, compressible and 
nearly-incompressible anisotropy is obtained by usi ng both INTYPE and 
ATYPE with or without a sign, respectively. 
3.  Incompressibility Limit. While there is no strict lower bound on the Poisson ’s 
ratio (|u1D71≠|u1D43FCst), for nearly-incompressible materials, LS-DYNA will  issue a warning 
message if  |u1D71≠ < |u1D71≠|u1D43FCst= 0.4 9. 
4.  Special Cases of the Compressible/Nearly-Incompress ible Ogden Model.   
The following described special cases of the OGDEN Model (ITYPE = ±1). 
a)  The (nearly-in)compressible neo-Hookean model is o btained as special 
case of ITYPE = (-)1 with |u1D7≠7|oneCst> 0, |u1D6F+|oneCst= 1. 
b)  The Mooney-Rivlin model is obtained as a special c ase of ITYPE = -1 with 
|u1D7≠7|u1D4J6Cst|u1D6F+|u1D4J6Cst> 0 for i = 1,2 , |u1D6F+|oneCst= 2, and |u1D6F+|twoCst= −2 . *MAT_ANISOTROPIC_HYPERELASTIC  *MAT_295  
 c)  By setting |u1D6FD = −1  and ITYPE = -1, one obtains an equivalent formulat ion 
with *MAT _077 _O. 
5.  General Structure Tensor.  Considering the anisotropic part of the strain 
energy function, one may distinguish angular integr ation (AI) and general 
structure tensor (GST) based models.  Owing to thei r numerical eﬃcacy, cur- 
rently all models in LS-DYNA rely on the general st ructure tensor [7] , [8] . Pa- 
rameters deﬁning the structure tensor and ﬁber mode ls need to be provided 
for each ﬁber family.  Consequently, one may use di ﬀerent structure tensors 
and/or ﬁber models to describe the behavior of the individual ﬁber families. 
The model proposed by Freed et al. [3]  is a special case of the general structure 
tensor-based models assuming rotational symmetric ﬁ ber dispersion, deter- 
mining the parameters A and B using a normal distri bution, and invoking the 
ﬁber model introduced by Freed and Doehring [2] . 
6.  Fiber Families.  Characteristic material directions within the plan e are deﬁned 
by ﬁber families.  The number of ﬁber families for INTYPE = 0 is currently 
limited to 3. If INTYPE = 1, the number of ﬁber fam ilies is limited to 2 that 
represent the ﬁber and sheet directions, respective ly.  The ﬁber and sheet direc- 
tions form an orthonormal basis. 
7.  Coupling (Quasi-)Invariants.  To further enhance the material model, coupling 
(quasi-) invariants associated with pairs of direct ions may be included in the 
strain-energy function.  Following the formulation in Holzapfel and Ogden [7]  
and Eriksson et al. [1] , a single coupling invariant deﬁned between the or - 
thonormal ﬁber and sheet directions is included wit h INTYPE = 1. 
8.  Onset of Active Stress. The input for this model gives you several diﬀerent  
methods for triggering the activation and deactivat ion of the active stress de- 
velopment.  
a)  For ACTYPE = 1, 2, 3, and 4, T0 speciﬁes the time at which active stress 
development is activated.  This method does not inc lude deactivation.  
The other methods take priority over setting T0. 
b)  For all ACTYPE options, you can specify ACID and A CTHR. ACID repre- 
sents the evolution of either the calcium ion conce ntration (ACTYPE = 1, 
2, 3, or 5) or the transmembrane potential (ACTYPE = 4) over time.  AC-
THR is a threshold value for one of these quantitie s depending on AC-
TYPE. When the calcium ion concentration or transme mbrane potential 
from the curve exceeds the threshold, the active st ress development is ac- 
tivated.  When it is less than the threshold, the a ctive stress development 
is deactivated.  With this method, the active stres s development can be re- 
activated again when the value in the curve exceeds  the threshold. *MAT_295  *MAT_ANISOTROPIC_HYPERELASTIC  
 c)  For all ACTYPE methods, if you set up a coupled pr oblem with the elec- 
trophysiology solver, ACTHR again gives the thresho ld value for the cal- 
cium ion concentration (ACTYPE = 1, 2, 3, or 5) or transmembrane 
potential (ACTYPE = 4).  The electrophysiology solv er provides the value 
to compare to the threshold to activate and deactiv ate the active stress de- 
velopment.  As with ACID, the active stress develop ment is activated 
when the value exceeds ACTHR and deactivates when t he value is less 
than ACTHR. With this method, the active stress dev elopment can be re- 
activated again when the value exceeds the threshol d. 
9.  Active stress development. Active stress is developed along direction(s) 
deﬁned by ACDIR and may be scaled using the scaling  factors SF, SS, and SN. 
For ACTYPE < 5, if SS and SN are zero, they are res et internally to ST.  
Depending on ACDIR active stress may develop along one or multiple ﬁber 
families.  Consider a single ﬁber family with unit ﬁber orientation vector /u1D41E/u1D45:.st. Let 
/u1D̅0F|u1D434Cst be the active stress.  Then, the active stress ten sor in the local ﬁber frame is: 
/u1D̅4∫|u1D434Cst=  /u1D̅0F|u1D434Cst|parenleftCv2SF /u1D41E/u1D45:.st⊗/u1D41E/u1D45:.st+ SS /u1D41E|u1D46≠Cst⊗/u1D41E|u1D46≠Cst+ SN /u1D41E|u1D4JBCst⊗/u1D41E|u1D4JBCst|parenriµhtCv2  . 
Here /u1D41E|u1D46≠Cst and /u1D41E|u1D4JBCst are the unit vectors in the sheet and normal direc tions that form 
a basis with /u1D41E/u1D45:.st. 
If active tension develops along multiple ﬁber fami lies, then the active stress 
tensor is: 
/u1D̅4∫|u1D434Cst= |summationCv1/u1D̅4∫|u1D434Cst|u1D4J6CstsNF 
|u1D4J6Cst=|oneCst  . 
In the above NF is the number of ﬁber families and /u1D̅4∫|u1D434Cst|u1D4J6Csts is the active stress ten- 
sor for the ith  ﬁber family. 
10.  Serial stress function. The serial stress function needs to be expressed in  
terms of the ﬁber stretch λ and contractile stretch λCE . Thus, the elastic stretch 
in the serial element  λSE  needs to be eliminated using the multiplicative de - 
composition of the ﬁber stretch, that is, λ=λ/C.st/E.st λ/S.st/E.st . 
11.  History Variables.   The history variables are listed in the table bel ow.  The 
default number of history variables depends on the used modules.  If only the 
mandatory ISOtropic module is used, the number of h istory variables is 9. In- 
cluding the ANISOtropic and ACTIVE modules in a hie rarchical fashion yields 
an additional 12 and 9 history variables, that is, making the total number of 
history variables 21 and 30, respectively.

|u1D7≠∆ =/u1D450|parenleftCv1|u1D447, |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst|parenriµhtCv1|u1D46≠ ,

The material parameter /u1D450 depends on material constants deﬁned in the variab le list 
above and the universal gas constant |u1D44J. 
 
The above equations can be rearranged to express th e equivalent inelastic strain rate |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst 
in terms |u1D7≠∆, |u1D447, and |u1D46≠ as

This is called the ﬂow equation.   
 
The rate of deformation resistance |u1D46≠̇ is deﬁned as  
|u1D46≠̇=/u1D4:B|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4JDCst  ,

Remarks: 
1.  Cohesive Elements for Modeling Gaskets.   A gasket is a mechanical seal 
placed between two mating surfaces to prevent leaka ge.  A gasket is typically 
thin in comparison to the length and width of its s urface.  This makes it cum- 
bersome to model with solid elements, since these r equire good aspect ratios.  
Cohesive elements, however, are less sensitive to t his kind of geometric quality 
and are, therefore, better suited for modeling gask ets.  To use cohesive ele- 
ments for modeling gaskets, the normal (the local 3-direction) of the cohesive 
element must be aligned with the gasket thickness d irection, and the mid-
surface of the cohesive element (the local 1-, and 2-direction) must coincide 
with the gasket surface.   
2.  Material Model.  The strains pertaining to the normal are deﬁned by:  |u1D7≠≠|oneCst|threeCst = |u1D6FF|oneCst, 
|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|threeCst = |u1D6FF|twoCst, and |u1D7≠≠|threeCst|threeCst = |u1D6FF|threeCst. |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst is the separation in local direction |u1D4J6 = 1,2,3 , meaning 
the relative displacement between the top and botto m face of the cohesive ele- 
ment measured along local direction |u1D4J6. In particular, −|u1D7≠≠|threeCst|threeCst  is the so-called gas- 
ket closure, /u1D450. The so-called membrane strains, |u1D7≠≠|oneCst|oneCst , |u1D7≠≠|oneCst|twoCst , and  |u1D7≠≠|twoCst|twoCst , in the plane 
orthogonal to the normal follow the usual deﬁnition  |u1D7≠≠|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = (|u1D71J|u1D4J7Cst|u1D462|u1D4J6Cst+ |u1D71J|u1D4J6Cst|u1D462|u1D4J7Cst)/2, 
where |u1D462|u1D4J6Cst, |u1D4J6 = 1,2 , is the local displacement of the mid-surface.  *MAT_COHESIVE_GASKET  *MAT_326  
 The cohesive gasket material model is comprised of the following three un- 
coupled material models:  
a)  Isotropic linear elastic membrane stress: 
⎣⎢⎡|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|oneCst 
|u1D7≠∆|twoCst|twoCst 
|u1D7≠∆|oneCst|twoCst ⎦⎥⎤= |u1D437
⎣⎢⎡|u1D7≠≠|oneCst|oneCst 
|u1D7≠≠|twoCst|twoCst 
2|u1D7≠≠|oneCst|twoCst ⎦⎥⎤ 
with |u1D437 as the constitutive matrix for either plane strain  or stress. 
b)  Isotropic linear elastic transverse stress: 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|threeCst= |u1D438|u1D447Cst /u1D446.st |u1D44JCst |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst, |u1D4J6 = 1,2 
c)  A user deﬁned pressure-closure relation of the for m (see Remark 3 ): 
−|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst ≡|u1D4JD = |u1D4J3 (/u1D450),        /u1D450> 0
|u1D7≠∆|threeCst|threeCst = 0, otherwise  
3.  Pressure-Closure Relation.  The pressure-closure relation, |u1D4J3, is an important 
feature of the material model.  It can be used to i nclude mechanical eﬀects that 
are typical for gaskets, such as hysteresis.  It co nsists of a main loading curve 
and one or more unloading curves.  
Figure M326-1  gives a schematic of a pressure-closure response.  As the gasket 
is compressed the closure, /u1D450, increases and the pressure, |u1D4JD, follows the main 
loading curve from A to, say, B. Now, if the gasket  for some reason is unloaded 
at B, /u1D450 will then decrease and |u1D4JD follows the unloading curve BCA back to the 
initial conﬁguration A. If the gasket is then reloa ded it will follow the path 
ACB back to B. Then, when /u1D450 exceeds the closure value at point B, it will con-

 tinue on the main loading curve until some new poin t D, where unloading 
takes place.  The new unloading then follows the pa th DEA back to A. If un- 
loading occurs between two unloading curves, interp olation is used to deter- 
mine the pressure. 
Which unloading path to follow and where to switch to the main loading curve 
is determined by keeping track of the maximum value  of /u1D450, called /u1D450max , at the 
last unloading point.  If the closure becomes negat ive, that is, the gasket is sub- 
ject to tension rather than compression, its stiﬀne ss is given by |u1D438|u1D447Cst|u1D438Cst|u1D441Cst . This is 
mostly for numerical stability.  The unloading curv es must be input using *DE-
FINE_TABLE_2D, with the ﬁrst dependency being maxim um closure and the 
second closure, meaning |u1D4JD = |u1D4JD(/u1D450|u1D4JACst|u1D44∆Cst|u1D46JCst ,/u1D450). Also, the unloading curves should be in 
a normalized form giving zero pressure for zero clo sure and unit pressure for 
unit closure. 
4.  History Variables.   This material model outputs the maximum closure a s 
history variable #1 to the post-processing database .  Therefore, NEIPH and 
NEIPS must be set in *DATABASE_EXTENT_BINARY. *MAT_ALE_VACUUM  *MAT_ALE_01

This may also be referred to as MAT_ALE_03.  This “ ﬂuid-like” material model is very 
similar to Material Type 9 (*MAT_NULL).  It allows the modeling of non-viscous ﬂuids 
with constant or variable viscosity.  The variable viscosity is a function of an equivalent 
deviatoric strain rate.  If inviscid material is mo deled, the deviatoric or viscous stresses 
are zero, and the equation of state supplies the pr essures (or diagonal components of 
the stress tensor).  All *MAT_ALE_ cards apply only  to ALE elements.

Remarks: 
1.  Deviatoric Viscous Stress.   The null material must be used with an equation-
of-state.  Pressure cutoﬀ is negative in tension.  A (deviatoric) viscous stress of 
the form 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst= 2|u1D7≠7|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst 
|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|<racketriµhtCvJ~|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ |<racketleftCvJ1
|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ 
is computed for nonzero |u1D7≠7 where |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst is the deviatoric strain rate.  |u1D7≠7 is the dy- 
namic viscosity.  For example, in SI unit system, |u1D7≠7 has a unit of [Pa × s] . 
2.  Hourglass Control Issues.   The null material has no shear stiﬀness and 
hourglass control must be used with care.  In some applications, the default 
hourglass coeﬃcient might lead to signiﬁcant energy  losses.  In general for 
ﬂuid(s), the hourglass coeﬃcient QM should be small  (in the range 10 -4 to 10 -6 
for the standard default IHQ choice). 
3.  Null Material Properties.   Null material has no yield strength and behaves i n 
a ﬂuid-like manner. 
4.  Numerical Cavitation.   The pressure cut-oﬀ, PC, must be deﬁned to allow for 
a material to “numerically” cavitate.  In other wor ds, when a material under- 
goes dilatation above certain magnitude, it should no longer be able to resist 
this dilatation.  Since dilatation stress or pressu re is negative, setting PC limit 
to a very small negative number would allow for the  material to cavitate once 
the pressure in the material goes below this negati ve value. 
5.  Issues with Small Values of Viscosity Exponent.   If the viscosity exponent is 
less than 1.0 ( RN < 1.0 ), then RN − 1.0 < 0.0.   In this case, at very low equiva- 
lent strain rate, the viscosity can be artiﬁcially very high.  MULO is then used 
as the viscosity value. *MAT_ALE_VISCOUS  *MAT_ALE_03  
 6.  Empirical Dynamic Viscosity.   The empirical variable dynamic viscosity is 
typically modeled as a function of equivalent shear rate  based on experimental 
data.

 Remarks: 
1.  Deviatoric Viscous Stress.   The null material must be used with an equation 
of-state.  Pressure cutoﬀ is negative in tension.  A (deviatoric) viscous stress of 
the form 
|u1D7≠∆′|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠7|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst
|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|<racketriµhtCvJ≈|<racketleftCvJ/u1D441
|u1D4JA|twoCst|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ |<racketleftCvJ1
|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ 
is computed for nonzero |u1D7≠7 where |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst is the deviatoric strain rate.  |u1D7≠7 is the dy- 
namic viscosity with unit of [Pa × s] . 
2.  Hourglass Control Issues.   The null material has no shear stiﬀness and 
hourglass control must be used with care.  In some applications, the default 
hourglass coeﬃcient might lead to signiﬁcant energy  losses.  In general for 
ﬂuid(s), the hourglass coeﬃcient QM should be small  (in the range 10 -4 to 10 -6 
for the standard default IHQ choice). 
3.  Null Material Properties.   The null material has no yield strength and behav es 
in a ﬂuid-like manner. 
4.  Numerical Cavitation.   The pressure cut-oﬀ, PC, must be deﬁned to allow for 
a material to “numerically” cavitate.  In other wor ds, when a material under- 
goes dilatation above certain magnitude, it should no longer be able to resist 
this dilatation.  Since dilatation stress or pressu re is negative, setting PC limit 
to a very small negative number would allow for the  material to cavitate once 
the pressure in the material goes below this negati ve value. 
5.  Issues with Small Value of Viscosity Exponent.   If the viscosity exponent is 
less than 1.0 ( RN < 1.0 ) then RN − 1.0 < 0.0 .  In this case, at very low equiva- 
lent strain rate, the viscosity can be artiﬁcially very high.  MULO is then used 
as the viscosity value. 
6.  Turbulent Viscosity.   Turbulence is treated simply by considering its e ﬀects on 
viscosity.  Total eﬀective viscosity is the sum of the laminar and turbulent vis- 
cosities, |u1D7≠7eff = |u1D7≠7|u1D4J9Cst+ |u1D7≠7|u1D461Cst where |u1D7≠7eff  is the eﬀective viscosity, and |u1D7≠7|u1D461Cst is the turbu- 
lent viscosity.  The turbulent viscosity is compute d based on the Prandtl’s 
Mixing Length Model,

This may also be referred to as MAT_ALE_06.  This i s the Herschel-Buckley model.  It is 
an enhancement to the power law viscosity model in *MAT_ALE_VISCOUS (*MAT_-
ALE_03).  Two additional input parameters: the yiel d stress threshold and critical shear 
strain rate can be speciﬁed to model “rigid-like” m aterial for low strain rates.   
It allows the modeling of non-viscous ﬂuids with co nstant or variable viscosity.  The 
variable viscosity is a function of an equivalent d eviatoric strain rate.  All *MAT_ALE_ 
cards apply only to ALE element formulation.

3.  If MULO > 0.0, and MUHI > 0.0, then MU LO and MUHI 
are lower and upper viscosity limit values for a po wer-
law-like variable viscosity model. 
4.  If MULO is negative (for example, MULO = - 1), then a 
user-input data load curve (with LCID = 1) deﬁning dy- 
namic viscosity as a function of equivalent strain rate is 
used. 
MUHI Upper dynamic viscosity limit (default = 0.0).  This is deﬁned 
only if RK and RN are deﬁned for the variable visco sity case.

Remarks: 
1.  Viscous Stress.   The null material must be used with an equation-o f-state.  
Pressure cutoﬀ is negative in tension.  A (deviator ic) viscous stress of the form 
|u1D7≠∆′|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = 2|u1D7≠7|u1D7≠≠′̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst

|u1D4JA|twoCst|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ |<racketleftCvJ1
|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ 
is computed for nonzero |u1D7≠7 where |u1D7≠≠′̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  is the deviatoric strain rate.  |u1D7≠7 is the dy- 
namic viscosity.  For example, in SI unit system, |u1D7≠7 has a unit of [Pa-s]. 
2.  Hourglass Control.   The null material has no shear stiﬀness and hourg lass 
control must be used with care.  In some applicatio ns, the default hourglass 
coeﬃcient might lead to signiﬁcant energy losses.  In general for ﬂuid(s), the 
hourglass coeﬃcient QM should be small (in the rang e of 10 -4 to 10 -6 for the 
standard default IHQ choice). 
3.  Yield Strength.   Null material has no yield strength and behaves i n a ﬂuid-like 
manner. 
4.  Pressure Cut-Off.   The pressure cut-oﬀ, PC, must be deﬁned to allow for a 
material to “numerically” cavitate.  In other words , when a material undergoes 
dilatation above certain magnitude, it should no lo nger be able to resist this *MAT_ALE_06  *MAT_ALE_HERSCHEL  
 dilatation.  Since dilatation stress or pressure is  negative, setting PC limit to a 
very small negative number would allow for the mate rial to cavitate once the 
pressure in the material goes below this negative v alue. 
5.  Viscosity.   If the viscosity exponent is less than 1.0, |u1D44J /u1D441 < 1.0 , then |u1D44J /u1D441 − 1.0 <
0.0.  In this case, at very low equivalent strain rate , the viscosity can be artiﬁ- 
cially very high.  MULO is then used as the viscosi ty value. 
6.  Herschel-Buckley Model.   The Herschel-Buckley model employs a large 
viscosity to model the “rigid-like” behavior for lo w shear strain rates ( |u1D6F∆̇< |u1D6F∆̇|u1D4J≠Cst).

 *MAT_SPH_VISCOUS  
This may also be referred to as *MAT_SPH_01.  This “ﬂuid-like” material model is very 
similar to Material Type 9 (*MAT_NULL).  It models viscous ﬂuids with constant or 
variable viscosity.  The variable viscosity is a fu nction of an equivalent deviatoric strain 
rate.  If an inviscid material is modeled, the devi atoric or viscous stresses are zero, and 
the equation of state supplies the pressures (or di agonal components of the stress 
tensor).

Remarks: 
1.  Deviatoric Viscous Stress.   This material must be used with an equation-of-
state.  Pressure cutoﬀ is negative in tension.  A ( deviatoric) viscous stress of the 
form 
|u1D7≠∆|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst= 2|u1D7≠7|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst

|u1D4JA|twoCst|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ |<racketleftCvJ1
|u1D46≠|<racketriµhtCvJ 
is computed for nonzero |u1D7≠7 where |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst is the deviatoric strain rate.  |u1D7≠7 is the dy- 
namic viscosity.  For example, in the SI unit syste m, |u1D7≠7 has units of [Pa × s] . 
2.  Hourglass Control Issues.   This material has no shear stiﬀness and hourglass  
control must be used with care.  In some applicatio ns, the default hourglass 
coeﬃcient might lead to signiﬁcant energy losses.  In general for ﬂuid(s), the 
hourglass coeﬃcient QM should be small (in the rang e 10 -4 to 10 -6 for the stand- 
ard default IHQ choice). 
3.  Null Material Properties.   This material since it is based on the null mater ial 
has no yield strength and behaves in a ﬂuid-like ma nner. 
4.  Numerical Cavitation.   The pressure cut-oﬀ, PC, must be deﬁned to allow for 
a material to “numerically” cavitate.  In other wor ds, when a material under- *MAT_SPH_VISCOUS  *MAT_SPH_01  
 goes dilatation above certain magnitude, it should no longer be able to resist 
this dilatation.  Since dilatation stress or pressu re is negative, setting PC limit 
to a very small negative number would allow for the  material to cavitate once 
the pressure in the material goes below this negati ve value. 
5.  Issues with Small Values of Viscosity Exponent.   If the viscosity exponent is 
less than 1.0 (RN < 1.0), then RN − 1.0 < 0.0 .  In this case, at very low equiva- 
lent strain rate, the viscosity can be artiﬁcially very high.  MULO is then used 
as the viscosity value. 
6.  Empirical Dynamic Viscosity.   The empirical variable dynamic viscosity is 
typically modeled as a function of equivalent shear rate  based on experimental 
data: 
|u1D7≠7|parenleftCv1|u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ|minuteCst|parenriµhtCv1 = RK × |u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ|minuteCst(RN−|oneCst)  . 
For an incompressible ﬂuid, this may be written equ ivalently as 
|u1D7≠7|parenleftCv1|u1D7≠≠̅̇|minuteCst|parenriµhtCv1 = RK × |u1D7≠≠̅̇|minuteCst(RN−|oneCst)  . 
The “overbar” denotes a scalar equivalence, the “do t” denotes a time deriva- 
tive or rate eﬀect, and the “prime” symbol denotes deviatoric or volume pre- 
serving components.  The equivalent shear rate  components may be related to 
the basic deﬁnition of (small-strain) strain rate c omponents as follows: 
|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst =1
2|parenleftCv6∂|u1D462|u1D4J6Cst
∂|u1D46J|u1D4J7Cst+∂|u1D462|u1D4J7Cst
∂|u1D46J|u1D4J6Cst|parenriµhtCv6⇒|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst= |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst − |u1D6FF|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |parenleftCvJ|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst 
3|parenriµhtCvJ
|u1D6F∆̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = 2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst  
Typically, the 2 nd  invariant of the deviatoric strain rate tensor is deﬁned as: 
/u1D4:C|twoCst|u1D7≠≠Cst̅̇/⋯inute.sts=1
2/˙racketleft.v2|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst/˙racketright.v2  . 
The equivalent (small-strain) deviatoric strain rat e is deﬁned as:  
|u1D7≠≠̅′̇≡2/radical.v2/u1D4:C|twoCst|u1D7≠≠Cst/⋯inute.stṡ=/radical.v:2/˙racketleft.v:|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst|u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst/˙racketright.v:=/radical.v:4/˙racketleft.v:|u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst|twoCst |minuteCst|twoCst+ |u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst|threeCst |minuteCst|twoCst+ |u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|oneCst |minuteCst|twoCst/˙racketright.v:+ 2/˙racketleft.v:|u1D7≠≠̇|oneCst|oneCst |minuteCst|twoCst+ |u1D7≠≠̇|twoCst|twoCst |minuteCst|twoCst+ |u1D7≠≠̇|threeCst|threeCst |minuteCst|twoCst/˙racketright.v:  . 
In non-Newtonian literatures, the  equivalent shear rate  is sometimes deﬁned as  
|u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ≡/radical.v5|u1D6F∆̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |u1D6F∆̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst

It turns out that when (a) the material is incompre ssible material ( |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J8Cst|u1D4J8Cst = 0) and 
(b) the shear terms are equivalent (when |u1D4J6 ≠/u1D45̅→ |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst = |u1D7≠≠̇|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4J7Cst |minuteCst), the equivalent shear 
rate  is algebraically equivalent to the equivalent (small-strain) deviatoric strain 
rate : 
|u1D7≠≠̅̇|minuteCst= |u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ|minuteCst  . *MAT_SPH_01  *MAT_SPH_VISCOUS  
 7.  Cross Viscous Model.   The Cross viscous model is one of simplest and mo st 
used model for shear-thinning behavior.  With shear -thinning behavior, the 
ﬂuid’s viscosity decreases with increasing local sh ear rate, |u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ.  Thus, using the 
Cross viscous model, the dynamic viscosity |u1D7≠7 is deﬁned as a function of |u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ: 
|u1D7≠7|parenleftCv1|u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ|minuteCst|parenriµhtCv1 = M UH I + (M U LO − M UH I)/(1.0 + RK × |u1D6F∆/overlinec⋯˙.lft/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.ex/overlinec⋯˙.rṫ|minuteCst)RN−|oneCst  . 
Here RK and RN are two positive ﬁtting parameters, and MULO and MUHI 
are the limiting values of the viscosity at low and  high shear rates, respectively.

The displacement origin of the “unloading” curve is  arbitrary, since it will be 
shifted as necessary as the element extends and con tracts.  On reverse yielding 
the “loading” curve will also be shifted along the displacement re or.  rotation 
axis.

compressive yield forces (TYI and CYI) deﬁne a rang e within which the ele- 
ment remains elastic (meaning the “loading” curve i s used for both loading

tion of time or incrementally following the approac h of Herrmann and Peter- *MAT_S07  *MAT_SPRING_MAXWELL  
 son [1968].  The continuous function of time implem entation has the disad- 
vantage of the energy absorber’s resistance decayin g with increasing time even 
without deformation.  The advantage of the incremen tal implementation is that 
an energy absorber must undergo some deformation be fore its resistance de- 
cays, meaning there is no decay until impact, even in delayed impacts.  The 
disadvantage of the incremental implementation is t hat very rapid decreases in

Remarks: 
The material behavior of the muscle model is adapte d from the original model 
proposed by Hill [1938].  Reviews of this model and  extensions can be found in Winters 
[1990] and Zajac [1989].  The most basic Hill-type muscle model consists of a contractile 
element (CE) and a parallel elastic element (PE) ( Figure MS15-1 ).  An additional series 
elastic element (SEE) can be added to represent ten don compliance. 
 
The main assumptions of the Hill model are that the  contractile element is entirely 
stress free and freely distensible in the resting s tate and is described exactly by Hill’s 
equation (or some variation).  When the muscle is a ctivated, the series and parallel 
elements are elastic, and the whole muscle is a sim ple combination of identical 
sarcomeres in series and parallel.  The main critic ism of Hill’s model is that the division 
of forces between the parallel elements and the div ision of extensions between the series 
elements is arbitrary and cannot be made without in troducing auxiliary hypotheses.  
However, these criticisms apply to any  discrete element model.  Despite these *MAT_S15  *MAT_SPRING_MUSCLE  
 limitations, the Hill model has become extremely us eful for modeling musculoskeletal 
dynamics, as illustrated by its widespread use toda y. 
 
 
 
When the contractile element (CE) of the Hill model  is inactive, the entire resistance to 
elongation is provided by the PE element and the te ndon load-elongation behavior.  As 
activation is increased, force then passes through the CE side of the parallel Hill model, 
providing the contractile dynamics.  The original H ill model accommodated only full 
activation - this limitation is circumvented in the  present implementation by using the 
modiﬁcation suggested by Winters (1990).  The main features of his approach were to 
realize that the CE force-velocity input force equa ls the CE tension-length output force.  
This yields a three-dimensional curve to describe t he force-velocity-length relationship 
of the CE.  If the force-velocity |u1D466-intercept scales with activation, then given the 
activation, length and velocity, the CE force can b e determined. 
 
Without the SEE, the total force in the muscle FM i s the sum of the force in the CE and 
the PE because they are in parallel: 
|u1D439/M.st= |u1D439/P.st/E.st + |u1D439/C.st/E.st   . 
The relationships deﬁning the force generated by th e CE and PE as a function of /u1D4:FM 
(length of the muscle), |u1D449M (shortening velocity of the muscle) and |u1D44∆(|u1D461) are often scaled 
by |u1D439max , the peak isometric force (p.  80, Winters 1990), /u1D4:F|zeroCst, the initial length of the 
muscle (p.  81, Winters 1990), and |u1D449max , the maximum unloaded CE shortening velocity 
(p.  80, Winters 1990).  From these, dimensionless length and velocity can be deﬁned as: CE a(t) LM

Figure  MS15-1.   Discrete model for muscle contraction dynamics, based o n a

generation by the muscle.  The series elastic element (SEE), shown in dashed 
lines, is often neglected when a series tendon compli ance is included.  Here, 
|u1D44∆(|u1D461) is the activation level, /u1D4:FM is the length of the muscle, and |u1D449M is the 
shortening velocity of the muscle. *MAT_SPRING_MUSCLE  *MAT_S15

|u1D449max × |u1D446|u1D463Cst[|u1D44∆(|u1D461)] 
Here, |u1D446|u1D463Cst scales the maximum CE shortening velocity |u1D449max  and changes with activation 
level |u1D44∆(|u1D461). This has been suggested by several researchers, t hat is, Winters and Stark 
[1985].  The activation level speciﬁes the level of  muscle stimulation as a function of 
time.  Both have values between 0 and 1. The functi ons |u1D446|u1D463Cst[|u1D44∆(|u1D461)]  and |u1D44∆(|u1D461) are speciﬁed 
using load curves in LS-DYNA, but the default value s of |u1D446v= 1 and |u1D44∆(|u1D461) = 0  can also be 
used.  Note that /u1D4:F is always positive and that |u1D449 is positive for lengthening and negative 
for shortening. 
 
The relationship between |u1D439CE , |u1D449 and /u1D4:F was proposed by Bahler et al.  [1967].  A three-
dimensional relationship between these quantities i s now considered standard for 
computer implementations of Hill-type muscle models  [Winters 1990].  It can be written 
in dimensionless form as: 
|u1D439/C.st/E.st = |u1D44∆(|u1D461) × |u1D439|mCst|aCst|xCst × |u1D4J3/ε.st /L.st (/u1D4:F) × |u1D4J3/ε.st /V.st (|u1D449) . 
Here, |u1D4J3TL (/u1D4:F) and |u1D4J3T V (|u1D449) are the tension-length and tension-velocity functi ons for active 
skeletal muscle.  Thus, if current values of /u1D4:FM, |u1D449M, and |u1D44∆(|u1D461) are known, then |u1D439CE  can be 
determined ( Figure MS15-1 ). 
 
If FPE = 0.0, the force in the parallel elastic ele ment, |u1D439PE , is determined directly from the 
current length of the muscle using an exponential r elationship [Winters 1990]: 
|u1D4J3PE =|u1D439/P.st/E.st 
|u1D439/M.st /A.st/X.st =

/u1D4:F|mCst|aCst|xCst (/u1D4:F− 1) |<racketriµhtCvJ− 1|<raceriµhtCvJ/u1D4:F> 1 
Here, /u1D4:F|mCst|aCst|xCst  is the dimensionless length at which the force |u1D439max  occurs, and |u1D43∆sh  is a 
dimensionless shape parameter controlling the rate of rise of the exponential.  
Alternatively, the user can deﬁne a custom |u1D4J3PE  curve giving tabular values of 
normalized force as a function of dimensionless len gth as a load curve. 
 
For computation of the total force developed in the  muscle |u1D439M, the functions for the 
tension-length |u1D4J3TL (/u1D4:F) and force-velocity f TV  relationships used in the Hill element must 
be deﬁned.  These relationships have been available  for over 50 years but have been 
reﬁned to allow for behavior such as active lengthe ning.  The active tension-length 
curve |u1D4J3TL (/u1D4:F) describes the fact that isometric muscle force dev elopment is a function of 
length, with the maximum force occurring at an opti mal length.  According to Winters, 
this optimal length is typically around /u1D4:F= 1.05 , and the force drops oﬀ for shorter or 
longer lengths, approaching zero force for /u1D4:F= 0.4  and /u1D4:F= 1.5 . Thus the curve has a 
bell-shape.  Because of the variability in this cur ve between muscles, the user must 
specify the function |u1D4J3|u1D447Cst|u1D43FCst (/u1D4:F) using a load curve, specifying pairs of points rep resenting *MAT_S15  *MAT_SPRING_MUSCLE  
 the normalized force (with values between 0 and 1) and normalized length /u1D4:F.  See 
Figure MS15-2 . 
 
The active tension-velocity relationship |u1D4J3T V (|u1D449) used in the muscle model is mainly due 
to the original work of Hill.  Note that the dimens ionless velocity |u1D449 is used.  When |u1D449 =
0.0, the normalized tension is typically chosen to hav e a value of 1.0.  When |u1D449 is greater 
than or equal to 0.0, muscle lengthening occurs.  A s |u1D449 increases, the function is typically 
designed so that the force increases from a value o f 1.0 and asymptotes towards a value 
near 1.4 ass shown in Figure MS15-2 .  When |u1D449 is less than zero, muscle shortening 
occurs and the classic Hill equation hyperbola is u sed to drop the normalized tension to 
0.0 as shown in Figure MS15-2 .  The user must specify the function |u1D4J3T V (|u1D449) using a load 
curve, specifying pairs of points representing the normalized tension (with values 
between 0.0 and 1.0) and normalized velocity |u1D449.

GAB Shear modulus in the |u1D44∆|u1D44F  direction.  Set to a very small value for an 
isotropic elastic material; see *MAT_FAB RIC.  If deﬁned to be 
zero, a default value of EA |parenleftCv22 × (1 + PRBA)|parenriµhtCv2 ⁄  will be used where 
EA is the Young’s modulus along the lon gitudinal direction and 
is set to 1% of the Young’s modulus determined by L S-DY NA

Remarks: 
1.  Loading and Unloading.  Each belt material deﬁnes stretch characteristics a nd 
mass properties for a set of belt elements.  The us er enters a load curve for 
loading, the points of which are (Strain, Force) .  Strain is deﬁned as engineer- 
ing strain, that is, 
Strain =current length 
initial length − 1.0 
Another similar curve is entered to describe the un loading behavior.  Both load 
curves should start at the origin (0,0)  and contain positive force and strain 
values only.  The belt material is tension only wit h zero forces being generated 
whenever the strain becomes negative.  The ﬁrst non -zero point on the loading 
curve deﬁnes the initial yield point of the materia l.  On unloading, the unload- 
ing curve is shifted along the strain axis until it  crosses the loading curve at the 
“yield” point from which unloading commences.  If t he initial yield has not yet 
been exceeded or if the origin of the (shifted) unl oading curve is at negative 
strain, the original loading curves will be used fo r both loading and unloading.  
If the strain is less than the strain at the origin  of the unloading curve, the belt 
is slack and no force is generated.  Otherwise, for ces will then be determined 
by the unloading curve for unloading and reloading until the strain again ex- 
ceeds yield after which the loading curves will aga in be used. *MAT_SEATBELT  *MAT_B01  
 2.  Damping.   A small amount of damping is automatically includ ed.  This 
reduces high frequency oscillation, but, with reali stic force-strain input charac- 
teristics and loading rates, does not signiﬁcantly alter the overall forces-strain 
performance.  The damping forced opposes the relati ve motion of the nodes 
and is limited by stability: 
|u1D437 =0.1 ×  mass × relati v e v elocity 
 time step si ze  
In addition, the magnitude of the damping force is limited to one-tenth of the 
force calculated from the force-strain relationship  and is zero when the belt is 
slack.  Damping forces are not applied to elements attached to sliprings and 
retractors. 
3.  Nodal Masses.  MPUL, the mass per unit length, is used to calculat e the nodal 
masses during initialization. 
4.  Minimum Length.   LMIN, the “minimum” length, controls the shortest  length 
allowed in any element and determines when an eleme nt passes through 
sliprings or is absorbed into the retractors.  One tenth of a typical initial ele- 
ment length is usually a good choice. 
5.  Bending and Compression Stiffness for 1D Elements.   Since one-
dimensional elements do not possess any bending or compression stiﬀness, 
dynamic analysis is mandatory during an implicit an alysis that includes belts.  
However, one dimensional belt elements can  be used in implicit statics by asso- 
ciating them with bending/compression properties wi th the ﬁrst optional card.  
Two-dimensional belt elements are not supported wit h this feature. 
To achieve bending and compression stiﬀness in one- dimensional belts, the 
belt element is overlayed with a Belytschko-Schwer beam element (see *SEC-
TION_BEAM, ELFORM = 2, for a more comprehensive des cription of ﬁelds A, 
I, J and AS) with circular cross section.  These el ements have 6 degrees of free- 
dom including rotational degrees of freedom.  The m aterial used in this context 
is an elastic-ideal-plastic material where the elas tic part is governed by the 
Young’s modulus, |u1D438.  Two yield values, F (the maximum compression/ten sion 
force) and M (the maximum torque), are used as uppe r bounds for the result- 
ants.  The bending/compression forces and moments f rom this contribution 
are accumulated to the force from the seatbelt itse lf.  Since the main purpose is 
to eliminate the singularities in bending and compr ession, it is recommended 
to choose the bending and compression properties in  the optional card careful- 
ly so as to not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the overall r esponse. 
For the sake of completeness, this feature is also supported by the explicit inte- 
grator; therefore, a rotational nodal mass is neede d.  Each of the two nodes of 
an element gets a contribution from the belt that i s calculated as RMASS =*MAT_B01  *MAT_SEATBELT  
 R × (MASS/2) × I/A , where MASS indicates the total translational mass  of the 
belt element and R is a scaling factor input by the  user.  The translational mass 
is not modiﬁed.  The bending and compression proper ties do not aﬀect the 
stable time step.  If the belts are used without  sliprings, then incorporating this 
feature is virtually equivalent to adding Belytschk o-Schwer beams on top of 
conventional belt elements as part of the modelling  strategy.  If sliprings are  
used, this feature is necessary to properly support  the ﬂow of material through 
the sliprings and swapping of belt elements across sliprings.  Retractors cannot 
be used with this feature.  *MAT_THERMAL

Rate Model for a Single Reaction: 
Chemical reactions are usually expressed in chemical equation notation ; for example, a 
chemical reaction involving two reactants and two p roducts is 
|u1D44∆A+|u1D44FB→|u1D4J4G+ℎH, (MT6.1)  
where A, B, G, and H are chemical species such as NaOH or HCl, and |u1D44∆, |u1D44F, |u1D4J4, and ℎ are 
integers called stoichiometric numbers , indicating the number of molecules involved in a 
single reaction. 
 
The rate of reaction is the number of individual re actions per unit time .  Using a stoichiometric 
identity, which is just an accounting relation, the  rate of reaction is proportional to the 
rate of change in the concentrations of the species  involved in the reaction.  For the 
chemical reaction in Equation (MT6.1) , the relation between concentration and rate, |u1D4JF, is, *MAT_THERMAL_CHEMICAL_REACTION  *MAT_T06  
LS-DYNA R13 3-19 (MAT_THERMAL) |u1D4JF=−1
|u1D44∆d[A]
d|u1D461=−1
|u1D44Fd[B]
d|u1D461=+1
|u1D4J4d[G]
d|u1D461=+1
ℎd[H]
d|u1D461, (MT6.2)  
where [X] denotes the concentration of species X, and the sign depends on whether or 
not the species is an input, in which case the sign  is negative, or a product, in which 
case the sign is positive. 
The Model 
This thermal material model (T06) is built on the a ssumption that the reaction rate 
depends on the concentration of the input species a ccording to 
|u1D4JF =/u1D458(|u1D447)/product.v1[X]|u1D4JDCst/u1D44B.sts
/u1D44B.st , 
where X ranges over all species, and, for each species, th e exponent, |u1D4JD/X.st, is determined 
by empirical measurement but may be approximated by  the stoichiometric number 
associated with X.  The proportionality constant, /u1D458, is related to the cross-section for the 
reaction, and it depends on temperature through the  Arrhenius equation: 
/u1D458= |u1D44D(|u1D447) exp |parenleftCvJ−|u1D438|u1D4J6Cst
|u1D44J|u1D447 |parenriµhtCvJ  , 
where |u1D44D(|u1D447)  is experimentally determined (see Card 6), |u1D438|u1D4J6Cst is the activation energy (see 
Card 7), |u1D44J is the gas constant, and |u1D447 is temperature.  As an example, for the chemical 
reaction of Equation (MT6.1)  
|u1D4JF = |u1D44D(|u1D447) exp |parenleftCvJ−|u1D438|u1D4J6Cst
|u1D44J|u1D447 |parenriµhtCvJ [A]/u1D6FC.st[B]/u1D6FD.st  , 
where the stoichiometric numbers have been used ins tead of experimentally 
determined exponents. 
 
The rate of heat generation (exothermic) and absorp tion (endothermic) associated with 
a reaction is calculated by multiplying the heat of  reaction, |u1D444|u1D4J6Cst, by its rate. 
User-Deﬁned Single Reaction Model: 
In addition to the standard model described in the previous section this material model 
also allows the user to specify a chemical reaction  rate equation.  In case of a single 
reaction model with two species, the equation can b e deﬁned using the *DEFINE_-
FUNCTION keyword.  Here, the equation can be given as function of the current 
temperature and concentration of the second species .  Consequently, the input may 
read as follows: 
 
*DEFINE_FUNCTION 
1, reaction rate 
chemrx(temp,conc)= …  *MAT_T06  *MAT_THERMAL_CHEMICAL_REACTION  
3-20 (MAT_THERMAL) LS-DYNA R13  
Note that in this case the actual argument names ar e used for the interpretation of the 
function: the material model expects the temperatur e argument to be names “temp” 
and the concentration of the second species to be d enoted by “conc”. 
Rate Model for a System of Reactions: 
For a system of coupled chemical reactions, the cha nge in a species’s concentration is 
the sum of all the contributions from each individu al chemical reaction: 
d[X]
d|u1D461= |summationCv1(±)|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JB(|u1D46J)|u1D4J6Cst|u1D4JF|u1D4J6Cst
|u1D4J6Cst  . 
The index i runs over all reactions; |u1D4JB(|u1D46J)|u1D4J6Cst is the stoichiometric number for species X in 
reaction |u1D4J6; and |u1D4JF|u1D4J6Cst is the rate of reaction |u1D4J6.  The sign (±)|u1D4J6Cst is positive for reactions that have 
X as a product and negative for reactions that invol ve X as an input.

For the following system of reactions: 
A→B   ⇒   |u1D4JF|oneCst= −d[A]

Equivalent Units (Normalized Units): 
The concentrations are often scaled so that each un it of reactant yields one unit of 
product.  Systems for which each species is assigne d its own  unit of concentration based 
on stoichiometric considerations are equivalent unit systems . 
 *MAT_THERMAL_CHEMICAL_REACTION  *MAT_T06  
LS-DYNA R13 3-21 (MAT_THERMAL) Being unit-agnostic, LS-DYNA is capable of working in equivalent units.  However, 
care must be taken so that units are treated consis tently, as applying a unit scaling to 
the time evolution equations can be nontrivial. 
1.  For each reaction, the experimentally measured pre -exponential coeﬃcients 
carry units that depend on the reaction itself.  Fo r instance, the pre-exponential 
factors |u1D44D|oneCst, |u1D44D|twoCst, and |u1D44D|threeCst for the reactions A→B, A + B→C, and 2B→C respec- 
tively will have units of 
[|u1D44D|oneCst] =1
[time]×1
[Concentration of A] 
[|u1D44D|twoCst] =1
[time]×1
[Concentration of A]×1
[Concentration  of B] 
[|u1D44D|threeCst] =1
[time]× |<raceleftCvJ1
[Concentration of B]|<raceriµhtCvJ|twoCst
. 
Note that each pre-factor has a diﬀerent dimensiona lity. 
2.  The equations in (MT6.2) , which relate rate to concentration change, are 
logically inconsistent unless all species are measu red using the same  units for 
concentration.  A species-dependent system of equiv alent units would require 
the insertion of additional conversion factors into  (MT6.2)  thereby changing 
the form of the time-evolution equations. 
To avoid unit consistency issues, we recommend 
that reactions be deﬁned in the same unit system 
that was used to measure their empirical values. 
Example of Equivalent Units: 
The following system of reactions: 
A→B
A + B→C
2B →C 
changes species A into species C through an intermediate which is species B.  For each 
unit of species C that is produced, the reaction consumes two units of species A (1 unit 
from the 1 st  and 1 unit from the 2 nd  equation).  Since this set of chemical formulae 
corresponds to the curing of epoxy, which is a near ly volume-preserving process, it is 
customary to work in a system of equivalent units t hat correspond to species volume 
fractions. 
 
The following set of equivalent units, then, is use d in the published literature: *MAT_T06  *MAT_THERMAL_CHEMICAL_REACTION  
3-22 (MAT_THERMAL) LS-DYNA R13 1.  Whatever the starting concentration of species A is, all units are uniformly 
rescaled so that [A] = 1  at time zero.  Per the boxed remark above, since t he 
constants were measured with respect to these units , this consideration does 
not introduce new complexity. 
2.  Since the process preserves volume, and since one particle of species C replaces 
two particles of species A (and one particle of B replace one of A), the units of 
concentration for species C are doubled. 
|u1D436̃= 2[C]

HGHOST Speciﬁc heat for ghost (quiet) material 
TGHOST Thermal conductivity for ghost (quiet) mater ial 
Remarks: 
This material is initially in a quiet state, someti mes referred to as a ghost material . In this 
state the material has the thermal properties deﬁne d by the quiet speciﬁc heat 
(HGHOST) and quiet thermal conductivity (TGHOST).  These should represent the 
void, for example, by picking a relatively small th ermal conductivity. 
 
However, the ghost speciﬁc heat must be chosen with  care, since the temperature must 
be allowed to increase at a reasonable rate due to the heat from the weld source.  When 
the temperature reaches the birth temperature, a hi story variable representing the 
indicator of the welding material is incremented.  This variable follows 
|u1D6F∆(|u1D461) = min |<racketleftCv61, max |parenleftCv60,|u1D447max − |u1D447|u1D4J9Cststart 
|u1D447|u1D4J9Cstend − |u1D447|u1D4J9Cststart |parenriµhtCv6|<racketriµhtCv6  , 
where |u1D447max = max {|u1D447(|u1D46≠)||u1D46≠ < |u1D461}. 
 
The eﬀective thermal material properties are interp olated as 
/u1D450̃|u1D4JDCst=/u1D450|u1D4JDCst(|u1D447, |u1D447max )|u1D6F∆ +/u1D450|u1D4JDCstq uiet (1 − |u1D6F∆)

3-26 (MAT_THERMAL) LS-DYNA R13 where  /u1D450|u1D4JDCst and |u1D7≠7 are the speciﬁc heat and thermal conductivity, res pectively.  Here, the 
speciﬁc heat, /u1D450|u1D4JDCst, is either a temperature dependent curve, or a col lection of temperature 
dependent curves, ordered in a table according to m aximum temperature |u1D447max . 
 
The time parameters for creating the material provi de additional formulae for the ﬁnal 
values of the thermal properties.  Before the birth  time |u1D461|u1D4J6Cststart  of the material has been 
reached, the speciﬁc heat /u1D450|u1D4JDCstdead  and thermal conductivity |u1D7≠7dead  are used.  The default 
values, that is, the values used if no user input i s given, are

thereby deﬁne a multistage welding process.  Prior to the birth time, the temperature is 
kept more or less constant due to the large speciﬁc  heat, and, thus, the material is

This is Thermal Material Type 17. The chemical spec ies making up this material 
undergo speciﬁed chemical reactions.  The chemical reaction kinetics is the same as for 
thermal material *MAT_T06, but the thermal conducti vity is assumed to be orthotropic.  
A maximum of 8 species and 8 chemical reactions can  be deﬁned.  The orthotropic 
thermal material properties of a ﬁnite element unde rgoing chemical reactions are 
calculated based on a mixture law consisting of tho se chemical species currently present 
in the element.  The dependence of the chemical rea ction rate on temperature is 
described by the Arrhenius equation.  Time step spl itting is used to couple the system 
of ordinary diﬀerential equations describing the ch emical reaction kinetics to the system 
of partial diﬀerential equations describing the diﬀ usion of heat.
